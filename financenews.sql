Who should you trust with your money?	By Priya Anand, MarketWatchBrokers, advisers and planners have different training and credentials and charge based on varying fee models and commissions for products they recommend. And even when markets are strong, as they are now, it is important to know what professional standards apply in each case.Some are held to a so-called fiduciary standard, which requires them to act in a client’s best interest. But others aren’t. The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law in 2010 amid the financial crisis, gave the Securities and Exchange Commission authority to require brokers to meet the fiduciary standard, but the SEC is still pondering a possible rule.For now, investors should interview investment professionals just as they would a job candidate, says Ohio Securities Commissioner Andrea Seidt, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association.Inquire about the credentials and licenses they hold to help ensure you are entrusting your money with someone who can meet your needs. Ask how they are compensated, whether they’re paid by the hour, are on retainer, make a commission from trades, or collect a percentage of the assets they manage. Check their backgrounds with state regulators, and run names through BrokerCheck, a website run by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, an industry-funded Wall Street watchdog.“People spend more time researching a car for $20,000 than they do when handing over their life savings,” Seidt says.• Brokers. Brokers can buy and sell securities — stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other products — for customers or for their own accounts. They must pass exams to qualify with state securities regulators and Finra. They are often employed by Wall Street banks, whose products they may favor even if a better or lower-cost option is available from another firm.Some brokers like to call themselves “financial advisers” or “investment consultants.” But they aren’t obligated to give what they consider the best advice. Instead, they are required only to recommend “suitable” investments based on a customer’s risk profile, financial status, age, investment goals and liquidity needs, among other factors.That means, in practice, that they can recommend investments with high fees or conflicts of interest that can benefit themselves or their firms ahead of the clients.“Unfortunately, when the market is going up in value like it is now, unsuitable investments are really hard to identify,” says Jason Doss, president of the Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association.Unsuitable investments become more obvious when markets sour, exposing unforeseen risks. Finra opened 560 arbitration cases involving the sale of unsuitable products to investors through May, on pace to surpass last year’s total of 1,243 cases.• Registered investment advisers. These advisers, also known as RIAs, are typically regulated under state and federal laws that require them to act solely in the best interests of their clients.Registered investment advisers who manage less than $100 million must register with their state securities agency, while those who manage more than that are generally required to register with the SEC. RIAs are also required to disclose conflicts of interest.Still, not everyone who is supposed to act in a client’s best interest does so. Finra opened 975 arbitration cases involving an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by a financial professional through May this year.•  Certified financial planners. Investors who want a professional to look at all their assets and liabilities and develop a plan for reaching their financial goals might opt for a certified financial planner. Many brokers and registered investment advisers are also CFPs.CFPs must pass an exam administered by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, an industry group. They also need three years of professional experience in financial planning or two years of apprenticeship, and have to undergo a background check.Like RIAs, CFPs are supposed to adhere to a high standard. They must act in “utmost good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the client,” according to the CFP Board rules of conduct.Depending on whether CFPs are also practicing insurance agents or brokers, they may, however, recommend only products on which they earn commissions or other payments. Investors should ask if a planner’s offerings are limited, and why.So which investment professional is right for you? First, figure out what you want from the relationship. An adviser or a planner might be a better choice if you want help from someone who is looking at the bigger picture or you are worried about being pushed to make risky investments.On the other hand, a broker who comes with references from family or friends and who has a clean record with state regulators might offer more diverse financial products than an independent planner or adviser, Seidt says.With all investment pros, experts say investors should request that the terms of the relationship, including fees and commissions, be put in writing. And stay vigilant.“It’s not just once and done,” Seidt says.More from MarketWatch:10 things rich people do better than youSneaky malware lurks on your computer until you log into your bankCaring for mom and dad?

You’re not talking about your salary nearly enough	By Mackenzie DawsonOur Protestant founding fathers would be appalled by all of this emoting.And they’d be even more appalled by what I’m going to say next, which is that I think we need to ditch the WASPy aversion to talking about money (“If you have to ask, you probably can’t afford it, darling!”) and instead start discussing our finances more openly.I don’t mean chatting about stocks and investments, or about what we paid for a car or an expensive pair of shoes — the latter qualifies as bragging, and it’s not very interesting on a date or at a cocktail party.I’m talking about money talk that can actually help and inform you. Salary talk. The stuff we’re not supposed to talk about right after we’re finished not talking about politics or religion or all the other topics that keep showing up in our Facebook /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB -0.24%  News Feed.For some reason, the taboo about money has held strong for centuries, and while attitudes are changing in some demographic groups — more on that later — I think it’s time to give it the boot, once and for all.When I moved to New York from Boston 12 years ago, I was shocked by how often people — not even close friends, but casual acquaintances — would ask how much I paid for rent. At first I would just laugh, hoping they’d take the hint and change the subject.But they didn’t. They kept asking. And after a year or so of living in Manhattan — yes, it took a year for the surprise to wear off — I started to realize that people weren’t being rude when they asked. They were being direct. They just wanted to know what the market was like, and where they stood on the scale: Were they getting a good deal, or at least paying a fair rate (“fair rate” in Manhattan being a relative term), or being bilked?And just as I came to appreciate the gorgeous transparency of the question as it applied to real estate, I realized the same applies to talking about salaries. This goes for everyone, but especially women. We’re more likely to shy away from the kinds of conversations that would help us the most. A survey of graduating professional students by Linda Babcock of Carnegie Mellon University, author of the book “Women Don’t Ask: The High Cost of Avoiding Negotiation,” depressingly found that only 7% of graduating women tried to negotiate their first job offers, whereas 57% of the men did so.“It’s a myth to believe that if you keep your head down, stay quiet, and just do a great job, then someone will notice and reward you handsomely with exceptional compensation. Totally untrue,” says Tory Johnson, CEO of Women for Hire, a recruitment services firm. “Not speaking up costs all of us countless mortgage payments and fancy shoes. We simply take what’s offered, as if we’re supposed to be thankful for anything.”Of course, then there are the times when women do negotiate, and it backfires spectacularly, as a recent New Yorker article by Maria Konnikova found. The article cites four different studies in which women interviewing for jobs were penalized for asking for higher compensation — even when the interviewers were women. Simply put, people didn’t like the idea of women asking for “too much,” and viewed it as aggressive and unappealing.This is bleak news for women who might have thought pay parity was simply a matter of asking for it.But this only makes the case for pay transparency stronger. When you’ve done the research and have the most relevant, accurate information about what you can expect to be fairly paid, that’s half the battle.Sound crazy? In Sweden, Finland and Norway, everyone’s personal income and tax information is regularly published online in the ultimate act of transparency (although I’m not sure how anyone is able to get any work done, given the glorious snooping opportunities).Of course, while many employees might be nodding their heads in agreement with this idea, there’s a pretty good chance their companies will not. Easy to see why, of course — keeping salaries hush-hush benefits companies, but not most workers.Many companies across various industries actually have clauses in their employee contracts that prohibit discussion of salary and benefits with other employees; others, including Apple, have reportedly conveyed the same message in their orientation programs, according to an article in The Wall Street Journal.But these companies might be surprised to learn that such policies aren’t legal , as the company Flex Frac Logistics, a trucking and freight shipping company, recently learned when an unfair labor practice case ruled against them. The National Labor Relations Act actually contains a provision that allows all employees to basically talk salary shop with each other without fear of punishment or termination.OK, so maybe you’re a manager who doesn’t want a full-scale employee riot on your hands after someone finds out that Jim in the cubicle next to them makes 30% more despite having the same job title. A reasonable concern. But one way for companies to combat this — and I’m not trying to sound like a Pollyanna — is to pay employees fairly in the first place, and for companies to regularly conduct internal assessments of pay practices to ensure that they aren’t using discriminatory policies.If your pay structure makes sense, there’s no problem. And when companies have Human Resources departments that support employees, workers will feel comfortable having a place to go to voice their concerns.While those above the age of 35 might still feel squeamish about the idea of discussing salary with friends and co-workers, there’s one group that probably doesn’t: millennials. This group, made up of those born in the 1980s and 90s, has come of age using social media, where sharing personal information is common, if not the entire point. Millennials have a different perception of privacy, and of what they are and aren’t willing to discuss, and they’re more likely to challenge traditional conventions if they don’t make sense to them.Companies might want to get ready — there’s soon going to be a whole lot of talking. And unlike previous generations of workers, which tended to do their whispering at the water cooler, these new, younger workers are more likely to be chatting about it on Twitter /quotes/zigman/23556538/delayed/quotes/nls/twtr TWTR -1.05%   and Facebook and Instagram, for everyone to see.Mackenzie Dawson is a contributing editor at the New York Post.

U.S in fresh German spying scandal	By Anton TroianovskiThe German federal prosecutor announced that a 31-year-old German had been arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of working for foreign intelligence agencies. The arrested man was an employee of the German foreign-intelligence agency, known as the BND, according to two people familiar with the matter.The worker initially raised suspicions because he apparently tried to contact Russian spies, but then told investigators he had been passing information to U.S. intelligence, one person said.The people briefed on the investigation cautioned that the man’s links to U.S. intelligence haven’t been conclusively established.But the suspicions were serious enough that Chancellor Angela Merkel was informed on Thursday and select members of parliament were briefed.Outraged reactions in the media made clear the allegations were already dealing a new blow to the U.S.-German relationship -- an alliance critical to matters as diverse as the Ukraine crisis and negotiations for a trans-Atlantic free-trade agreement.“This is a very serious development,” a spokesman for Merkel said. “The government will now await the conclusions of the federal prosecutor and federal criminal police’s investigation.”Deputy Foreign Minister Stephan Steinlein urged U.S. Ambassador John B. Emerson in their Fourth of July meeting to help clear up the matter quickly, a ministry statement said.U.S. officials in Washington and Berlin declined to comment.Ties between the U.S. and Germany are still strained after last year’s revelations of National Security Agency activities and U.S. monitoring of Merkel’s cellphone. The leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden struck a particular nerve in a country acutely sensitive to domestic spying because of its history with Communist and Nazi mass surveillance.Read the full article on WSJ.com here.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A754C03C-0391-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-04

Soon everyone will be an electric company	By Bill SandersonThe idea of powering the electric grid from a multitude of sources is called distributed generation. Homeowners can already buy solar generators and furnaces that simultaneously produce heat and electricity. On the horizon are home battery systems that could let homeowners store solar power generated during the day for use at night.Distributed generation isn’t pie-in-the sky — the know-how exists to build these systems. But the technology is held back by cost and by regulations that don’t allow for tiny contributions to the power grid. Federal energy experts figure costs will drop and regulatory issues will be overcome, and that the amount of electricity homes and businesses produce through distributed generation could roughly double over the next 25 years. That’s not enough to replace big generating plants, but enough to have a big impact.Here’s a rundown of the three main distributed generation technologies.SolarThis is the big story for residential consumers. Prices for home solar systems have dropped 10% a year for the last five years, according to Sanford C. Bernstein Research. Home solar installations already compete on price with utilities in Hawaii and Washington, D.C., Bernstein says. It also says home utility customers in parts of California, the Southwest and the Northeast will find solar increasingly practical because of the rising price of natural gas used to run big generating plants.Solar City, a California-based company, installs solar panels on homes in 15 states, including New York, California and Texas. Its 100,000 customers pay via a leasing plan with monthly payments. “We can offer many homeowners power at a lower rate than they pay their utility,” said company spokesman Will Craven.Sunrun, another player in the solar market, says its panels can produce electricity at a cost of 10 cents to 13 cents per kilowatt hour — competitive with the 2013 national average residential electricity price of 12.12 cents per kilowatt hour.Sunnyvale, Calif., resident Louis Gray installed Sunrun panels on his family’s home in March. Instead of paying by the month, Gray opted to pay $17,000 up front for a 20-year lease. Sunrun installed, owns and maintains the system. Gray’s bill from PG&E, the local electric utility, has dropped from $200 to $300 a month to about $20.“We estimate we will save $60,000 in the 20 years,” said Gray, who is married and has three children. “It’s probably the best decision we’ve made all year financially. There’s only so many ways you can take costs out [of your budget] every month, and this has been a great one.”You don’t need to live in a perpetually sunny climate to use solar. Germany — which gets about the same amount of sun as Washington state — is the biggest user of solar energy in the world. On a national holiday in June — admittedly a low-power use day — solar generated half of Germany’s electricity.In the U.S., solar now provides just 0.2% of all electricity. Bernstein foresees rapid growth in solar in the coming years as the price of solar panels continues to fall. Eventually, the company says, home solar will take a sizable amount of business away from operators of big electricity generators.Solar City, Sunrun and other solar companies make money by leasing or selling the solar systems they install. They say once installation and maintenance costs are figure in, many customers will end up spending less on electricity. Customers may also benefit by selling their excess power back into the electric grid.Combined heat and power unitsThe home versions of these systems — called microCHP for short — use the same heat that warms your home to generate electricity. Japanese residential electric customers operate 155,000 microCHP units, and Europeans operate 45,000 of them, says Mike Cocking, a microCHP consultant in Wisconsin.Only a few hundred microCHP units operate in the U.S., but Cocking expects the number to grow. In simple terms, microCHP units are home furnaces with electric generators attached. The energy that heats your home also turns a turbine that makes electricity. “The whole value proposition for this technology type is that you have to heat your home anyway,” Cocking said. “What happens is, you are heating with this device, and electricity comes along as a free byproduct.”A microCHP unit installed in 2009 in a 56-unit Bronx, N.Y., apartment building provides hot water and electricity, and saved its owner $17,000 in electricity costs in its first year. Cocking says a Dover, Mass., family with a microCHP system has used the system to heat its home and generate power at a cost of 15 cents per kilowatt hour when the local utility’s going rate was 23 cents.A downside of the units for owners of single-family homes is that in warm weather, the heat they produce can go to waste. So in the residential market, microCHP is mainly practical in big houses with some need for heat year round. The Massachusetts home Cocking cited uses microCHP as a swimming pool heater in the summer. Cocking says engineers are working on microCHP heating/cooling systems that will be more broadly practical.Electricity storage systemsHome battery systems are still being developed, by electric vehicle maker Tesla Motors /quotes/zigman/118681/delayed/quotes/nls/tsla TSLA -0.08%  and others.Solar City and Tesla are marketing home battery systems in parts of California, and hope to offer them nationwide by the end of the year. The system can store enough electricity to work like a backup generator and “keep the lights on and fridge cold in a power outage or natural disaster,” Solar City says on its website. Attached to the grid, the systems could also let people gain from utilities’ time-of-use pricing plans by letting them store electricity bought when prices are low for use when prices are high.A University of Delaware program does something similar with electric car batteries. Willett Kempton, a professor of electrical engineering and computing and director of the university’s Center for Carbon-free Power Integration, is overseeing studies of a fleet of electric cars that make money by providing stability to the power grid. When grid demand is low, the cars’ batteries fill up with electricity. When demand is high, the cars’ batteries pump the stored electricity back into the power grid.Grid operators will pay for the stability provided by the cars’ batteries. Kempton says a car plugged into the system can earn its owner $90 to $100 a month. “It’s an advantage to be paid for having your car sitting in the garage,” he said.Kempton doubts Solar City, Tesla or other companies will come up with a home-storage system better than the battery in an electric car. He sees no need for electric car owners to invest in home electricity storage. “If you buy an electric car, you have a very large storage device,” he said. “Why would you buy a second large storage device?”The Delaware program is backed by the local utility and power grid operator — but regulations keep it from spreading. “We can’t offer this throughout the United States yet,” Kempton said. But the technology is here. “This works on its own. It’s just a matter of getting different areas of the country to change the rules.”Bill Sanderson blogs about New York-area utilities at www.nypowerandlight.com .More from MarketWatch:How to pay less for everythingDavid Einhorn’s top small-cap picksGold might be up this year, but it’s worth only $800	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A8684F94-02D7-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-04
David Einhorns top small-cap picks	By Meena Krishnamsetty and Javier HasseYou may think this is just one data point and his other large-cap stock picks probably outperformed the market by a large margin. Unfortunately, an equal-weighted portfolio of Einhorns large-cap picks that are disclosed in 13F filings outperformed the market by an average of 11 basis points a month between 2008 and 2012. These stocks had a risk-adjusted monthly alpha of -6 basis points.Blue Harbour Group isnt good at picking large-cap stocks. What makes it successful is its small-cap stock picks. These stocks generated double digit annual outperformance during the same five year period. Our research has shown that the most popular small-cap stocks ($1 billion to $5 billion market cap) among hedge funds have historically outperformed the market by an average of 18 percentage points a year ( read the details ). If you want to have a decent shot at beating the market, you should take a look at David Einhorns top small-cap picks. David Einhorn seems to be aware of his edge in small-cap companies. Among his 20 most valuable long equity positions, 6 are placed at companies with market caps below $4 billion. The funds biggest small-cap bet is the one at Oil States International, Inc. /quotes/zigman/271016/delayed/quotes/nls/ois OIS +1.00% , a $3.35 billion market cap worldwide provider of specialty products and services to oil and gas drilling and production companies. Although Greenlight Capitals position in the company remained unchanged over the last reported quarter, a series of stock sales that Barry Rosensteins Jana Partners made over June have transformed Mr. Einhorns fund in the largest hedge fund shareholder in the company — among the 700 funds that we track. Its 2.75 million shares are worth more than $270 million. Following the June disposals, Jana Partners owns 2.6 million shares, down from the 6.1 million shares held at the end of Q1. Second in this list is CONNS, Inc. /quotes/zigman/91157/delayed/quotes/nls/conn CONN -0.55% , a $1.8 billion market cap specialty retailer of branded consumer durable goods, and a provider of consumer credit, oriented at supporting its customers purchases. As reported in Greenlight Capitals investor letter, this was a newcomer to Mr. Einhorns portfolio in Q1. Here is what Einhorn said about this position: CONN is a specialty retailer of appliances, furniture, mattresses and electronics with 79 locations in Texas and the Southwest. CONN finances 77% of customer purchases through its proprietary subprime credit portfolio. In February, the company announced 33% comparable-store sales growth in Q4 with strong gross margins. However, it also announced increased credit losses and reduced earnings guidance from a range of $3.80-$4.00 to a range of $3.40-$3.70 for calendar 2014. Given the markets past experience with deterioration in subprime credit, the stock reaction was severe: The price fell from $79 at the start of the year to $32 on the news. We believe that this is a retailer with 15-20% unit growth and current double digit comparable-store sales growth, and that the market overreacted to moderately bad news. We acquired shares at an average price of $35.49 and they ended the quarter at $38.85. Greenlight Capital last declared owning 3.3 million shares, worth more than $128 million. In addition, Christian Leones Luxor Capital Group holds 3.5 million shares, which account for more than 2.5% of its total equity portfolio. Babcock & Wilcox Co /quotes/zigman/604218/delayed/quotes/nls/bwc BWC +0.55% is a $3.6 billion market cap technology innovator in power generation systems, a specialty manufacturer of nuclear components and a service provider. Greenlight Capital owned 3.8 million shares, worth more than $127 million at the end of Q1. While the fund slightly decreased its stake in the company over the last reported quarter, Clifton S. Robbins Blue Harbour Group almost quintupled its bets over the period, and continued to buy its stock in Q2. The fund last declared ownership of 6.62 million shares, a 6.0% -activist- stake. Next is McDermott International /quotes/zigman/203905/delayed/quotes/nls/mdr MDR +0.63% , a $1.9 billion market cap engineering, procurement, construction and installation company, engaged on designing and executing complex offshore oil and gas projects. After almost doubling his stakes over Q1, Mr. Einhorn is the largest hedge fund shareholder of record at the company. His 14.04 million shares, worth more than $109 million, account for more than 1.6% of his total equity portfolio. The second largest hedge fund investor trails Greenlight from far behind. Were talking about Mark McGoldrick and Jason Maynards Mount Kellett Capital Management, which started a position over Q1 and now owns 4.497 million shares of the company. Finally, theres Take Two Interactive Software Inc. /quotes/zigman/62747/delayed/quotes/nls/ttwo TTWO +0.49% , a $2.2 billion market cap developer, marketer and publisher of interactive entertainment for consumers, responsible for hit game sagas like Grand Theft Auto. Once again, Greenlight Capital is the largest hedge fund shareholder, with 4.8 million shares-after a 15% increase in its stake over Q1, the funds position is worth more than $105 million. Another prominent investor betting on this company is Ken Griffin (Citadel Investment Group), who recently — more than- doubled his exposure to the gaming company, and last declared owning 3.9 million shares.Click here to learn more about Insider Monkeys Hedge Fund NewsletterInsider Monkeys small-cap strategy returned 97.6% between September 2012 and June 2014, beating the S&amp;P 500 index by more than 53 percentage points.

Hurricane Arthur strengthens, makes landfall on East Coast	By Karishma Mehrotra, Laura Stevens and Valerie BauerleinArthur weakened quickly to a Category 1 hurricane, with 90 mile-per-hour winds, after making landfall Thursday night as a Category 2 storm on the southern end of the Outer Banks. It was expected to be downgraded further to a post-tropical cyclone by Saturday.“We expect the storm to lose its tropical characteristic tonight or tomorrow and become a post tropical cyclone,” said National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen. He said the storm wouldn’t have “the structure of a hurricane anymore.”At 2 p.m. EDT Friday, Arthur was located about 125 miles southeast of Atlantic City, N.J., and 255 miles southwest of Chatham, Mass. The storm, which picked up in speed, was expected to pass southeast of New England Friday evening before hitting Nova Scotia early Saturday.Despite its weakening, Fourth of July barbecue and fireworks plans were still a wash for residents and vacationers along the coast, with the heaviest rains Friday in the mid-Atlantic and New England. High winds and dangerous surf were still also expected Friday and Saturday in areas where tropical storm warnings had been issued, including parts of Virginia, Nantucket, Cape Cod and Nova Scotia.Massachusetts emergency officials predicted eastern Rhode Island and Massachusetts could receive between three and 5 inches of rain, and said hurricane-force winds were possible in the waters south and east of Nantucket. Authorities also warned beachgoers of a higher-than-usual risk of rip currents over the weekend.Flight cancellations were minimal on the East Coast, since the storm remained mostly offshore.Arthur made landfall at 11:15 p.m. EDT Thursday between Cape Lookout and Beaufort, N.C., packing 100 mph winds and leaving about 44,000 customers without power Friday morning. Other reports were of fallen debris and washed-out roads, but state officials said damages were “minimal.” No injuries or deaths were reported.The majority of the customers without power were in Carteret County. The entire island of Ocracoke was also without power.“Basically, what we’re looking at right now is relatively minimal damage,” said North Carolina emergency-management agency spokesman Rick Martinez. “There were a couple of homes in Bertie County that had some roof damage. Everything else appears to be debris, primarily.”As much as 8 inches of rain fell in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Parts of the northern coast remained flooded, according to a travel advisory issued by North Carolina authorities. Access to Hatteras Island was still restricted, although most access to the Outer Banks has been reopened. In Manteo, N.C., U.S. Highway 64 was closed Friday morning because of flooding.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.<STRONG>More must-reads from MarketWatch:</STRONG>The most patriotic July 4th beer?

Alcoa earnings: Aerospace demand, aluminum pricing to be in focus	By Tomi KilgoreEarnings : Analysts are expecting Alcoa /quotes/zigman/246295/delayed/quotes/nls/aa AA +0.88%   to report earnings of 12 cents a share for the quarter ending June 30, up from earnings of 7 cents a share, excluding one-time items, reported in the same period a year ago., according to FactSet. That forecast has climbed steadily since the end of 2013, when analysts were projecting earnings of 8 cents a share. The company has beat analysts earnings estimates in eight of the last 10 quarters. In the first quarter, Alcoa reported a net loss of 16 cents, a share, but a profit of 11 cents a share if one-time restructuring-related charges were excluded.Revenue : Analysts are expecting revenue to decline 4.1% to $5.61 billion for the quarter from $5.85 billion a year ago, according to FactSet, as global supply issues have weighed on aluminum prices. After the company reported a 6.5% year-over-year decline in revenue for the first quarter, Fitch Ratings downgraded Alcoa’s credit rating to “junk” status, citing concerns over the impact of weak aluminum pricing. Alcoa has topped revenue estimates in seven of the past 10 quarters.Stock reaction : Alcoa’s stock has rallied 16% since the end of the first quarter through Thursday, and is up 41% so far this year, versus gains of 6% and 7.4%, respectively, for the S&P 500. Since Sept. 23, 2013, when the stock was booted out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the shares have soared 81%, while the Dow has advanced 11% over the same period. However, the stock hasn’t had a great track record of rising after results. Looking back at the day after the company’s last 10 quarterly reports were revealed, the stock closed lower five times, according to FactSet.Key points : Investors will keep an eye on Alcoa’s outlook for the global aerospace sector, given that the company announced last month that it acquired Firth Rixson for $2.85 billion to bolster its aerospace business. In early April, Alcoa increased its 2014 growth estimate for the global aerospace market to 8% to 9%, from 7% to 8%, citing strong demand for large commercial and regional jets. The company’s outlook for global aluminum demand will also be of interest, given all the concerns over pricing. In April, Alcoa affirmed its forecast of 7% growth in 2014.More must reads from MarketWatch :More than half of 2014’s new jobs payer higher than average wagePepsico’s Indra Nooyi explains why women can’t have it allFour biggest threats to the Internet: Pew study look ahead to 2025	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F868D752-02D7-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

The smartest way to make a portfolio of index funds	By Jonathan ClementsThe choice has ballooned over the past decade. Today, there are 319 stock and bond index-mutual funds and 1,525 exchange-traded index funds in the U.S., according to Chicago investment researchers Morningstar. Thanks to all these funds, it’s possible for investors to capture the performance of almost any market index imaginable, often at astonishingly low costs.But how do you pick from among these funds, so you build a sensible index-fund portfolio? Here’s how I tackle the problem.Strong Core: I have roughly half my fund portfolio in three core index funds, which track the total U.S. stock market, international developed-market stocks and short-term corporate bonds. Want to keep your investment life simple? You could build a fine portfolio with just these three funds. The two stock funds will give you a shot at getting richer, while the bond fund will help ensure you don’t end up poor.Cash, not bonds: The late Peter Bernstein, an economist and best-selling author, argued in a 1989 article that a portfolio with 75% stocks and 25% cash investments, such as Treasury bills and money-market funds, was no riskier than a classic balanced portfolio, with its mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, and had generated superior returns.I think about that argument as I look at today’s investment choices. Stocks strike me as overpriced, but I’d still rather overweight them and skimp on bonds. Even if bond prices aren’t clobbered by rising interest rates, returns will almost certainly be modest, given today’s tiny yields.Go for a money-market fund instead? It’s tempting, but that would mean earning a zero yield. That’s why I’ve taken a small step out on the maturity spectrum and opted for short-term corporate bonds instead. But my enthusiasm is tepid. A one-percentage-point rise in interest rates would wipe out two years’ worth of yield, hardly a cheery prospect. Indeed, because of that risk, I also have a substantial portion of my “bond” money in short-term certificates of deposit, though the yields there are even worse.Small stakes: What about the other half of my portfolio—the portion that isn’t in my three core funds? I look for parts of the market that might provide reasonable long-run performance in a low-return environment, while also offering added diversification.To that end, I have dedicated exposure to international small-cap stocks, emerging-market stocks, emerging-market bonds, and U.S. and foreign real-estate investment trusts. None of these positions is huge. All the index funds are low-cost and easy to understand.What about mutual funds and ETFs that pursue strategies typically associated with hedge funds? They, too, could be great ways to diversify. But they’re too costly and complicated for my taste.American values: As you’ll gather, in my search for added diversification, I have often ended up investing abroad. Today, foreign stocks represent 36% of my stockholdings, up from 30% a few years ago. That, however, is still less than a market weighting. For instance, foreign stocks account for roughly half of the FTSE Global All Cap Index.Why not invest more abroad? As I see it, most of my retirement money will be spent on U.S. goods and services, so I should match my assets with my future liabilities and keep most of my money in dollar-denominated investments.Problem is, U.S. stocks are richly valued. To compensate, I’ve tilted toward value shares, those that appear cheap based on yardsticks like price-to-book value and price-earnings ratios.Value stocks often hold up better in down markets, and historically they have delivered better returns than growth stocks. Value stocks also tend to pay higher dividends. Regularly returning cash to shareholders is, I believe, a good discipline for management. And if future stock returns are modest and I can collect, say, 3% in dividends every year, it won’t take much share-price appreciation to notch a half-decent total return.Stay balanced: For all the index funds mentioned above, I have target portfolio percentages. Occasionally, I rebalance back to these targets, moving money from the funds that have performed well to those that have lagged behind. That keeps my portfolio’s risk level under control.But rebalancing, especially among my stock funds, can also boost returns. As the underlying sectors cycle in and out of favor, my hope is to add a little to my portfolio’s return by buying low and selling high. For instance, I have 5% of my stock portfolio earmarked for U.S. REITs. After 2013’s lackluster performance, I bought REITs at the end of last year. But with 2014’s rebound, my REITs are now above my 5% portfolio target. I’ll likely be trimming those this year.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=BA85E0EE-02D0-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Boeing deliveries rise 7%, led by Dreamliner	By Jon OstrowerThe Chicago-based plane maker /quotes/zigman/220026/delayed/quotes/nls/ba BA +0.70%  on Thursday said it delivered 181 jetliners during the quarter, beating a record set a year earlier. Of those, 30 were Dreamliners, roughly double the amount a year ago and a record for that program, which is central to Boeing’s commercial fortunes. The deliveries included the first of Boeing’s 787-9, a longer version of the plane that avoided the development woes of the first model and commands a higher price tag.The figures come on the eve of the U.K.’s Farnborough International Air Show, which begins on July 14. Wall Street and the aviation industry will be closely watching the order activity at the show for any sign of a slowdown in the record aircraft purchasing over the last several years.Concerns about sustainable demand from Asian carriers and a spate airline profit warnings haven’t dented the confidence of both Boeing and rival Airbus Group NV, which have accelerated the output of its factories to record levels.Separately, Norwegian Air Shuttle AS Chief Executive Bjørn Kjos said he aims to add more Dreamliners, as the European low-fare carrier expands its international service. The airline is looking to purchase 20 more 787-9 jets for delivery after 2018, Mr. Kjos said in an interview at London Gatwick airport as the airline began service from there to New York.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.<STRONG>More must-reads from MarketWatch:</STRONG>More than half of 2014’s new jobs pay higher than average wagePepsico’s Indra Nooyi explains why women can’t have it allMcDonald’s ‘worst’ burgers may be hurting the stock	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=42EB7600-02DC-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Why new fund managers can beat those with experience	By Sanjoy GhoshThe industry is set up to give a sense of stability above all else. The returns can be lackluster, with many risk-averse managers index-hugging, or at the very least, taking care not to make any bold moves.For investors looking for outsized returns — who are willing to take on more risk — there is one segment of money managers that’s worth a look. A growing body of research shows that newer, smaller emerging funds — those with less than two or three years of history and lower assets under management — can often generate returns that beat the established players.Starting a fund is an entrepreneurial effort. And similar to start-ups, an emerging manager can be more nimble and more focused. They’re not weighed down by a bloated corporate structure or traditional ways of doing things. There’s less risk aversion at a startup than at a company that is careful to protect a brand built over decades.When a hot startup goes public, many individual investors pile in. Or wish they had gotten in even sooner with options.But individual investors rarely think that way about their money managers, more often opting to invest their money in large mutual funds with brand names from storied asset-management firms. Even when investing in hedge funds, the most searched-for criteria are assets under management and longevity. In this aspect of their investing, track record and reputation almost universally trump all other criteria.Meanwhile, institutional investors and university endowments are beginning to recognize that emerging managers can be a high-growth part of an overall investment solution. They’re keen to identify rising stars and discover hidden talent. They recognize that emerging managers can generate significant upside due, in part, to their smaller size, and some of these sophisticated investors go through the very labor-intensive task of building emerging-manager programs to capture some of that growth.The data bear this out: For instance, in a study by analytics platform eVestment, “young” hedge funds (fewer than two years of performance data) have outperformed those with longer life spans since at least 2003, on both an annualized and a risk-adjusted returns basis.That leaves the question: How do you vet them, given the shorter performance history? And how can you spot talent?There are, in all likelihood, multiple approaches that would work. I’ll describe one — and it’s the one my team decided to implement at our company, Covestor. Our business model is that we’ve created a marketplace of both emerging and established portfolio managers that investors can choose from. Here’s how we try to separate out those managers who might be performing well due to sheer luck versus skill:Look across peer groups: You can’t look at any portfolio in isolation and know whether it is doing a good job. Even if it has strong absolute returns, that doesn’t mean the fund manager is particularly smart. There might be other portfolio managers of similar size and with similar goals actually getting better returns without taking on more risk. This is particularly important when there is a lack of a long history, where you can see how the fund has performed in various market environments and cycles. If you want to see how good a portfolio manager is, compare him or her to others who are trying to do the same thing. The bigger the peer group, the better. That’s where you can identify the manager who has competitive skill and talent.Get handy with ratios: Our favorite mechanisms for comparing performance are four ratios: Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar and Omega. Each one of these allows you to view the performance of an investment against the amount of risk associated with it. You don’t need to be a quantitative mathematician, or even plot these yourself. You should be able to find some version of these on the fact sheets of any fund that you’d invest in.Here is a quick cheat sheet on what these ratios can do for you:• Sharpe ratio: Simply stated, this measures the performance of the portfolio (versus the risk-free rate) against how volatile it is. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better returns at lower volatility.• Sortino ratio: This works in a similar way to the Sharpe ratio, but only takes into account the downward movement of the investment when measuring its riskiness.• Omega ratio: This is a relative measure of the likelihood of achieving a given return, such as a minimum acceptable return or a target return. The higher the omega value, the greater the probability that a given return will be met or exceeded. This is a good way to match investments to your own goals.Another way of choosing the right emerging fund manager is to choose more than one. It’s an important principle that investors don’t put all their eggs in one basket, but rather mix and match funds and strategies. That goes for emerging managers as well.If you do your homework on these emerging managers, you can be positioned well to find a star manager while they’re still in their growth phase, when their returns tend to be strongest. The precise allocation to emerging managers in your overall investment portfolio will depend on your risk profile, as some of these untested managers are by some measures riskier than a longtime fund manager.Sanjoy Ghosh is the chief investment officer of Covestor, an online investment-management company with offices in Boston and London.More from MarketWatch:What stock market’s first half tells us about second half5 keys to a successful late-start retirement planThe one word working women should use less often	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=6F800F1A-0137-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Obama not mulling new bank reform, spokesman says	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- President Barack Obama is not considering new legislation to regulate the financial sector, despite his suggestion in a radio interview on Wednesday night that reform of the sector remained unfinished, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Thursday. The president wasnt referring to any specific regulation or law that he had in mind, but rather the need to continue to vigilantly monitor financial markets, to assess risks that may be emerging and to ensure that the necessary regulatory protections are in place, Earnest said during the daily press briefing. Obama told Marketplace that bank reform was an unfinished piece of business. He said that regulators continue to see a lot of these banks take big risks because the profit incentive and the bonus incentive is there for them rather than doing what it is supposed to be doing to grow the real economy.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C1E3DD9A-9DAD-49FC-A40C-9E8E71357845&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Bonds trim losses as jobs gain leaves Fed view intact	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchMarket participants have been looking for signs that economic growth is accelerating fast enough that the central bank would have to hike its key interest rates sooner and quicker than once thought. While a Labor Department report showed that the U.S. added an above-consensus 288,000 new jobs in June, it wasn’t enough to rethink current low-rate views.The 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR 0.00%  yield, which rises as prices fall, was up 1.5 basis points on the day at 2.645%, despite climbing to an intraday high of 2.685%, according to Tradeweb.Expectations of a strong headline payrolls number had been building after a similarly strong private-payrolls report on Wednesday. Thursday’s data marks the fifth consecutive month of payrolls that exceeded 200,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.1%.Nonetheless, wage growth, an indicator of how labor market gains are seeping into the broader economy, remained subdued. One such measure, average hourly earnings, rose just 0.2%, which some say is unlikely to change the Federal Reserve’s policy expectations.Also read: More than half of new 2014 jobs pay above the average“At the end of the day of the day you can’t get consumer spending unless you have income growth,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities, who believes the data means the 10-year Treasury yield won’t be able to push through its recent trading ceiling of 2.75% in the near-term.Nonetheless, some strategists do believe this data point may usher in a broader repricing in the market.“The dip buyers are in after the data, and while we have followed this thought process over the last four employment reports, looking for the sell-off into payrolls and yield highs shortly after the actual print, we do think this time is different,” said Richard Gilhooly, U.S. director of interest-rate strategy at TD Securities, in a note.He added: “Technically and fundamentally, we expect yields to start a gapping process higher over coming weeks and months, led by the 2-3 yr sector where we think the biggest carry and roll-down trade is positioned.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR 0.00%  yield rose 1 basis point to 3.479% while the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR 0.00%  yield rose 2.5 basis points to 1.737%. The difference between them narrowed, suggesting a slight revision in expectations about how the Fed may raise its key interest rates.Traders who use futures contracts to bet on the path of the fed funds rate project a 58% chance that the first rate hike will happen in June 2015, versus the previous day’s probability of 51%, according to CME FedWatch.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Dow tops 17,000 for first time; S&P also closes at a record10 things rich people know that you don’t5 markets with the best (and worst) potential for landlords	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=FD96B64A-02AF-11E4-8F8A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Dow tops 17,000 after jobs report beats expectations: live blog recap	A strong jobs report Thursday was enough to push the Dow Industrials to their first close above 17,000 in holiday-shortened trading. Here’s the recap of the day’s record activity. Also see a compact rundown of the day’s trading activity in Market Snapshot.Good morning.Stocks are opening higher.The U.S. created 288,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate fell to 6.1% — beating expectations.The Dow has topped 17,000 for the first time ever.Here’s how the main indexes look in the first few minutes of trading:Dow +0.3% to 17,034 at last check — clearing the 17,000 mark for the first time ever. Now can it close above that level?S&P 500 +0.3% to 1981 — also an intraday recordNasdaq +0.4%Photo credit: Getty Images“This was a strong report any way you slice it,” says Omair Sharif, economist at RBS Securities.“Yabadabadu!” …that’s what Justin Wolfers of the Brookings Institution had to say.“Still, without a clear step up in wages, and whilst the unemployment rate remains 6-something percent, we suspect the Fed will be loathe to change its formal stance with respect to the taper, or to the possibility of normalising rates,” says Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING.That’s all from MarketWatch’s Greg Robb, who has a roundup of various reactions here — and the roundup also features the adjacent chart.Bulls and bears are talking about the Dow topping 17,000:Dow 17k.

U.S. dollar hits three-week high versus yen on jobs	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe greenback bought 102.21 Japanese yen /quotes/zigman/4868099/realtime/sampled USDJPY -0.1202%  on Thursday, the most in over three weeks on a closing basis. That compares with ¥101.79 in the previous session, according to FactSet.The payrolls report showed the U.S. created 288,000 nonfarm jobs in June , surpassing official expectations of 215,000, although forecasts drifted higher following an above-consensus private payrolls report on Wednesday. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.1%.Nonetheless, wage growth remained subdued, suggesting that gains in the labor market aren’t fully flowing through to the broader economy. Average hourly earnings rose a meager 0.2%, one factor that may keep the Fed from shifting its rate-hike views.“We haven’t yet hit the ball out of the park when it comes to jobs.” said Dean Popplewell, director of currency analysis and research at OANDA, adding that instead, “it’s been somewhat tempered and that’s been expressed in the price action.”The ICE U.S. dollar index /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY +0.07%  , which measures the strength of the American currency against a basket of rivals, edged up to 80.222, versus 79.956 on Wednesday. A rival benchmark, the WSJ Dollar Index /quotes/zigman/9625991/realtime XX:BUXX +0.03%  , was at 72.98, up from 72.73.A decision by the European Central Bank on Thursday to leave its main interest rate unchanged helped push the euro lower against the dollar. The ECB left its refinancing rate at 0.15%, as expected. It also left its deposit rate at minus 0.1%, one month after dropping it into negative territory .The euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/realtime/sampled EURUSD -0.1088% sank to $1.3604, from $1.3666 late Wednesday.

This means that companies are still able to keep their profit margins. And as the ISM numbers indicated, services-sector growth is slowing slightly. Markets would like to see economic growth without a jump in inflation and that is a hard balance to keep,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial .The U.S. economy added 288,000 new jobs in June, and the unemployment rate fell to 6.1%. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, ticked up 2,000 to 315,000 in the week ended June 28, hovering near a postrecession low for several months, the Labor Department said.

‘Princess Eugenie’ poised to win Wimbledon?	By Steven KutzWith native son Andy Murray now out of the tournament, Bouchard is the closest thing British fans have to one of their own to root for. That’s because Bouchard and her twin sister are named after Queen Elizabeth’s granddaughters: Eugenie and Beatrice. Their mother, it turns out, loves the Royals.Bouchard is 20-years-old and has had a very successful year, reaching at least the semifinals of her third straight Grand Slam tournament. She won the Wimbledon girls’ championship in 2012, and her ranking has risen from No. 66 a year ago to No. 8 earlier this week.Chris Evert, who won Wimbledon in 1974, 1976 and 1981 and now does commentary on matches for ESPN, says she thinks Bouchard will win the tournament. “I’m a believer,” she said minutes after Bouchard’s semifinal win.Bouchard will face Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic in the final on Saturday.

Another good find in specialty pharma	By Bill GundersonObviously, this is good news for Salix and its investors as it paves the way for future FDA approval. Salix Pharmaceuticals /quotes/zigman/87125/delayed/quotes/nls/slxp SLXP +0.63%  is a stock I began purchasing just a few weeks ago for my growth accounts. The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, is a specialty pharmaceutical company that specializes in gastroenterology treatments.On July 9, Salix is hosting an investor day which, according to the company, will provide further details about its strategy, market opportunities for current products, product pipeline milestones — including a review of Xifaxan®(rifaximin) — and the companys financial outlook and drivers of future growth.Besides the much anticipated Target 3 trial results, analysts have been touting the stock as an excellent take-over target given its strong franchise of gastroenterology drugs. Xifaxan was already an antibiotic approved for use to avoid a complication from liver disease called hepatic encephalopathy . The drug is on pace to generate more than $700 million in revenue in 2014. Should it receive approval for the IBS-D indication as well, the drug could generate as much as $2 billion in revenue.Another trend in pharma recently are U.S. companies buying non-US companies for a tax inversion play. Salix is a prime a candidate for a so-called accountants merger in order to reduce its tax rate. Several other pharmaceutical firms like Mallinckrodt, Alexion, Perrigo, have taken advantage of this tax strategy .So Salix Pharmaceutical seems to have a lot going for it at the moment, but lets take a closer look using my Best Stocks Now analysis...............Salix Pharmaceutical is a mid-cap name with a market capitalization of $7.8 billion, and given the fact it is a specialty pharma stock which involves some speculation, its risk profile is aggressive...............The companys valuation on forward basis is actually only 16.5 times earnings, which translates into a stock valuation grade of “B+.” Given a very conservative five-year annual growth rate of 17.67%, this gives it a PEG ratio of less than 1 at only .94.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=56F40EE4-1671-4F91-975B-076607F194CA&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

10 things home-improvement stores won’t tell you	By Charles Passy, MarketWatchSummer is when many Americans spend plenty of time working on home improvement projects. That inevitably means many Americans will also be spending plenty of time--and plenty of dollars—at the big-box stores that have come to dominate the home-improvement industry—particularly, Home Depot /quotes/zigman/229488/delayed/quotes/nls/hd HD +0.09% and Lowe’s /quotes/zigman/232508/delayed/quotes/nls/low LOW +0.23% , which are responsible for around 80% of the industry’s $153.8 billion in annual revenue, according to market researcher IBISWorld.And with the economy (and perhaps more pertinently, the housing market) showing signs of improvement in recent years, both companies have become investors’ favorites. Home Depot stock is up roughly 180% since the end of 2009 and Lowe’s is up about 100%; by contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 60% during that same period.But shoppers haven’t shown quite as much enthusiasm as investors. In a J.D. Power survey of six major home improvement and hardware retailers, Lowe’s ranked third and Home Depot fourth; Ace Hardware, a network of mostly independently owned, neighborhood-oriented stores, took the top spot, which arguably suggests that consumers prefer that model over the big box one. And on consumer-oriented sites such as Consumerist.com, stories abound of experiences gone awry at Home Depot and Lowe’s, particularly involving installation issues.Perhaps most telling of all: While many retail experts thought the big box home improvement chains might spell the demise of independent hardware stores, it appears the mom-and-pops are holding their own against the giants. IBISWorld predicts hardware stores will see slightly better annual growth (2%) in the years ahead than the home improvement giants (1.7%). While the big-box chains can often offer an extensive selection of items and low pricing, they can’t always compete in terms of personal service or the ability for shoppers to get in and out of the stores quickly and easily. Hardware stores tend “to be more welcoming to customers,” says IBISWorld analyst Jocelyn Phillips.For their part, Home Depot and Lowe’s emphasize the many positives they bring to the shopping experience. A Lowe’s spokeswoman touts the fact that “Lowe’s offers more in-stock appliances than any other retailer and offers easy installation services.” A Home Depot spokesman points to the fact that the chain is “continually working to improve” customer service “regardless of any rankings” and that its efforts include making sure “store associates are able to spend the majority of their time assisting customers rather than (on) operational tasks such as stocking shelves.”See also: 10 things home inspectors won’t tell you.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=AB77A256-02C4-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

European stocks advance, euro falls after ECB meeting	By Carla Mozee, MarketWatchThe Stoxx Europe 600 index /quotes/zigman/2380150/delayed XX:SXXP -0.28% ended up 0.9% at 348.91, a third win in a row.Stocks extended gains in afternoon trade at the same time the euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/realtime/sampled EURUSD -0.1088%  dipped below $1.36 against the U.S. dollar, and hit its lowest level against the British pound /quotes/zigman/4868107/realtime/sampled EURGBP -0.1499%  since September 2012. The greenback /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY +0.07%  enjoyed broad strength against its major rivals after the U.S. economy added a stronger-than-expected 288,000 jobs in June.The European Central Bank left its main lending, or refi, rate unchanged at 0.15%, as expected, and made no changes to other key rates. The bank also left its deposit rate unchanged at negative 0.10% after last month lowering it into negative territory for the first time. The ECB in June launched measures aimed at boosting low levels of inflation and spurring stronger economic growth.“We’ve had a lot of momentum behind the markets over the course of recent weeks heading into a meeting when everybody knows [ECB President Mario] Draghi isnt going to announce any kind of monetary tightening,” Commerzbank economist Peter Dixon said in an interview Thursday.“The markets basically are operating under this principle that central banks generally remain fairly accommodative,” he said.Ahead of the ECB rate statement, data released Thursday showed a June slowdown in business activity in the euro zone, though activity in Italy logged the fastest pace of growth in more than three years.Among equities, Ingenico SA /quotes/zigman/164437/delayed FR:ING -0.57%  put in the best performance on the Stoxx 600, leaping 9.5% as the French payment terminals maker agreed to purchase GlobalCollect, an online payment provider, for €820 million ($1.12 million).Vodafone /quotes/zigman/29536547/delayed UK:VOD +0.92% pushed higher by 1% after the European Commission cleared the telecom company’s €7.2 billion ($9.83 billion) proposed purchase of Ono, Spain’s largest cable operator.But Balfour Beatty PLC shares /quotes/zigman/152520/delayed UK:BBY -0.76% took a 4.5% hit after the company warned of “further worsening” in the mechanical and electrical engineering part of its U.K. construction business.

The most patriotic July 4th beer? Anthem Golden Ale	By Charles Passy, MarketWatchThe back story: It seems every locale wants to position itself as the next “it” place for craft beer. Vermont, San Francisco, Portland (Maine and Oregon) and hipster-obsessed Brooklyn have all had their turns. So why not Maryland? At least that’s how the folks at Baltimore-based Union Craft Brewing see it. They’re part of a wave of beer makers who have set up shop in the state in recent years — in fact, the number of craft brewers in Maryland has more than doubled in the past five years to 25-plus.Union, which started in 2012, has made nearly two dozen different beers to date, but none may be more distinctly American — or more Maryland-inspired — than Anthem. That’s because it honors one of the state’s most famous native sons, a lawyer, author and amateur poet by the name of Francis Scott Key, who happened to write the lyrics for what became our national anthem, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” some 200 years ago. To honor the bicentennial of the anthem, Union created Anthem, a golden ale. “We used all American-grown ingredients,” says Adam Benesch, Union’s co-founder, of the brew’s patriotic grain recipe (barley, wheat, corn, oats). Benesch is also quick to point out the can’s red, white and blue coloring.What we think about it: This is an easy-to-drink craft brew, the kind that’s perfect for those accustomed to mass-market beers (yes, we’re talking to you Bud drinkers), but would like to try something with a little more character and malty sweetness. It’s got just a hint of bitterness — enough to give the beer some depth, but not so much as to make it challenging to enjoy. And there are floral notes as well.How to enjoy it: Don’t overthink this one. Anthem is a relatively uncomplicated beer that’s best appreciated as a basic thirst-quencher. Enjoy it cold or pair it with spicy foods — say, Buffalo wings. Or better yet, pair it with a good fireworks display.

Wal-Mart should fix its image problem over worker pay	By Carol KoppIn fact, the country’s biggest employer was getting fairly defensive as it explained the logic behind its pay scale. So defensive that you have to wonder why it doesn’t just bow to the inevitable and pay its employees better, instead of pouring all that public-relations energy into explaining why it can’t or won’t do that.I say the shift to higher pay is “inevitable” because nine U.S. states have already passed increases in their state minimum wages this year, and 38 are considering doing so. When the debate over a federal minimum wage died in Congress, the political pressure went local, particularly to cities and states with a high cost of living.Wal-Mart /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed/quotes/nls/wmt WMT +0.17%  could anticipate the trend by a few months and look great.That’s what Ikea did. The happy news from the Swedish retailer is that it will rraise the minimum average hourly wage it pays employees in its U.S. stores to $10.76. That will mean an average 17% raise for those workers, starting January 1. Ikea management said it does not expect to have to increase prices to pay the higher wages.Ikea’s starting wage will be based on a regional “living wage calculator” that estimates the minimum income needed for a single person without children to survive. So, Ikea workers won’t exactly be rolling up to those superstores in BMWs, but they will be eating regularly.Another big retailer, Gap /quotes/zigman/227242/delayed/quotes/nls/gps GPS +0.84%  , also recently announced a decision to raise its salaries, starting with increases this month to at least $9 an hour and a second increase, to $10, in June 2015. Starbucks /quotes/zigman/20720/delayed/quotes/nls/sbux SBUX +1.11%   didn’t announce a wage increase, but it introduced a college tuition plan for its employees, and urged other companies to look at the total compensation picture in considering positive changes.At the same time, Wal-Mart is in the news for defending itself against an opinion column by writer Timothy Egan in the New York Times in which he called Wal-Mart “a net drain on taxpayers, forcing employees into public assistance with its poverty-level wages.”Wal-Mart responded vigorously on its company blog , with a “Fact Check” of Egan’s column in which it insisted that Wal-Mart is not, in fact, a net drain on the American taxpayer.Predictably, conservative writers called Wal-Mart’s response “epic” and “devastating.” Equally predictably, a writer for the Huffington Post, Mark Gongloff, called it “Mostly bull.”The question is whether Wal-Mart is shooting itself in the foot by arguing on the losing side. The company is ignoring, or disputing, a strong and widespread concern among economists as well as the general public that low-wage jobs are undermining America’s economy and the health and well-being of its working population.In his column, Egan noted that Wal-Mart had a disapproval rating of 28%, according to a recent poll by Lake Research Partners. Wal-Mart responded that it is “pretty sure any corporation, politician even media outlet would like to have a 72% favorability rating.”In fact, the survey by Lake Research Partners shows Wal-Mart has by far the highest disapproval rating of any major American retailer. Target /quotes/zigman/253872/delayed/quotes/nls/tgt TGT +1.26%   scored a 13% disapproval rating, followed by Costco /quotes/zigman/67728/delayed/quotes/nls/cost COST +0.52%   at 6%, and Amazon.com /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN +1.39%   at 4%.The survey concluded that, “An important share of consumers do not believe Wal-Mart treats their employees well. This affects how they feel about Wal-Mart and their willingness to shop there.” In addition, it said that the company’s pay and treatment of workers is “leading even some of its most loyal customers to consider avoiding the store.”Wal-Mart’s slogan is “Save Money. Live Better.” Highly effective — if it proves that its employees can live better, too.Carol Kopp is a Minyanville contributor.More from MarketWatch:Ikea and 7 other companies paying more than minimum wage40% of unemployed workers are millennialsThe payrolls report is right, and GDP isnt	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=DAB965EA-02BF-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Technology paves road to freedom from OPEC	By Kirk SpanoThe main reason for the rangebound energy prices in America — which I discussed here — is the rapid pace of energy-related technology the past decade. From hydraulic fracturing to solar, advances in energy technology are positively offsetting some of the negative issues still causing a drag on the economy, i.e., depressed demand due to demographics and persistently high household debt. In the United States, energy costs, which are low compared to many nations, are being driven primarily by new supplies of natural gas and light sweet crude oil that have been opened by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.The new oil and gas supplies have become a battleground for the ideological and misinformed. On one side are those in the drill, baby, drill camp who believe that the United States is just a few years from being energy independent if only it were allowed to be. On the other are those who are anti-development for environmental reasons. Analysis from both sides is suspect.Recently, an article ran the headline “Dream of U.S. energy indepencence was just revised away.” The article noted that the Monterey Shale in California just had its estimated recoverable oil slashed by the Energy Information Agency (EIA) from 13.7 billion barrels to 600 million barrels. What the article did not delve into is that the lead engineer on the project pointed out that changes in technology in the future could drive development at a later date. The article went on to trumpet that along with that oil come tremendous water demands, environmental, and infrastructure damages. It is clear the authors real agenda wasnt pure analysisForeign Affairs May/June issue focused on fracking. In one article, Citigroup analyst Edward L. Morse hammers it home when he says ...the costs of finding and producing oil and gas in shale and tight rock formations are steadily going down and will drop even more in years to come. I will go out on a very short limb here and say that estimates for recoverable oil in the Monterey Shale will be revised upward in coming years.Those who glom on to the idea that the United States could be energy independent due to new natural gas and oil development have it equally wrong. The U.S. still imports about 110 million barrels a month from OPEC nations, which is down about two-thirds from a decade ago. Oil imports from non-OPEC nations, led by Canadas 95 million barrels per month and Mexicos likely to rise 20-something-million-barrels per month will not be replaced until there is significant demand destruction for oil. The idea that the U.S. would be completely oil independent is a pipe dream. Any notions that America should export non-refined oil is an actual threat to prices at the pump and the domestic economy.If projections hold and the U.S. can produce another two billion barrels of oil per year and hold that level for a decade or two, then we will at least be able to eliminate our OPEC dependence entirely. This will allow America to be able to continue to back away from policing Middle Eastern conflicts. While fracking has its drawbacks, and clearly requires tight regulation, what it saves us is truly immeasurable — ask any disabled veteran from a recent Middle Eastern deployment.While I have focused on oil so far, it is American natural gas that is the true big deal. U.S. supplies of natural gas are abundant enough to replace dirty coal in our utilities for base energy, be a cleaner fuel for heavy vehicles, allow for more competitive manufacturing domestically and still have enough for limited export to allies. Development of our unconventional natural gas will continue if for no other reason than it is cleaner than coal and oil when developed, transported and used properly.Soon, the race toward ultimate demand destruction for oil will be on, as we will have to replace oil as a our fuel for transportation in the next few decades for both economic and environmental reasons. The United States bounty in natural gas, as well as the continued deployment of solar and eventual development of electric vehicles will play the core roles in weaning ourselves off of oil by later this century.For investors, staying away from ideological aspects of energy is critical in making good decisions (its probably good for the voting booth as well). What we know is that development of land-based American oil will continue on the upward trend for about a decade and for natural gas a few decades before leveling off and eventually falling.The Market Vectors Oil Services ETF /quotes/zigman/7870964/delayed/quotes/nls/oih OIH +0.10%  is a good play on the oil- and gas-service companies with holdings such as Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes. All of these companies stand to benefit from both domestic and international shale development as they are among a handful of global experts in the field.The sector has run higher on the recent Middle Eastern news and solid business the past year. There is likely to be a brief slowdown in development short-term, as the easy money becomes less easy, and eventually international oil markets settle back. I am not in OIH right now, however, I am planning to buy again on any real pullbacks for my firms tactical ETF portfolios.Disclosure: Kirk and certain clients of Bluemound Asset Management are long Chesapeake Energy.

London regulator says Uber is operating legally	LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Londons transportation regulator on Thursday said private-driver provider Uber is operating within the law. Licensed taxi drivers in London last month staged a protest urging Transport for London to find that Ubers mobile app acts as a taximeter, which is illegal for use by private-hire vehicles. TFL said in its view that smart phones that transmit location information (based on GPS data) between vehicles and operators, have no operational or physical connection with the vehicles, and receive information about fares which are calculated remotely from the vehicle, are not taximeters within the meaning of the legislation.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=4BDA4C81-9505-4F72-B0D5-11E1064D0E2F&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Oil futures set for 6th straight session loss	By Myra P. Saefong and Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatchExpectations of increased crude supplies from Libya kept pressure on prices, although crude managed to pare some of its losses on the back a stronger-than-expected jobs report.Oil for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.28%  fell 42 cents, or 0.4%, to settle at $104.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Tracking the most-active contracts, prices lost 1.6% for the holiday-shortened week, and finished at their lowest level since June 6. Floor trading will remain closed Friday for the July 4th holiday.The U.S. oil benchmark may continue to pull back in the short term, Matthew Weller, senior technical analyst at Forex.com, said in a note Thursday. The contract is “testing a key support confluence from its bullish trend line and the 50-day (moving average) around $103.50,” and if that area is breached, that might result in a quick move down toward the 200-day moving average near $100 a barrel, he said.The U.S. economy added 288,000 jobs in June, and the unemployment rate fell to a nearly six-year low of 6.1%, the government reported Thursday. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected an addition of 215,000 jobs, along with an unemployment rate of 6.3%.Upbeat economic data often provides support for prices, as they raise the prospects for energy demand, but concerns surrounding potential production disruptions from Iraq and expectations for more supplies from Libya following a deal to reopen two terminals kept pressure on oil.“Now that the bears are in control and have momentum on their side, we will likely continue to pull back into the major moving averages, with the first stop being the 50 day at $103.30,” said Tyler Richey, an analyst for the 7:00’s Report, which offers daily markets commentary. “But, looking past the near term, crude prices will remain elevated as long as economic data remains strong and demand is set to continue rising.”August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -0.38%  shed 24 cents, or 0.2%, to end at $111 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.Back on Nymex, August gasoline /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 -0.23%  fell less than half a cent to$3.02 a gallon, while August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821453/delayed HOQ4 -0.35% shed nearly 2 cents to $2.93 a gallon. At the retail level, drivers were expected to see the highest July 4 gasoline prices since 2008 thanks to Iraq.Natural-gas prices settled higher after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that supplies of natural gas rose 100 billion cubic feet for the week ended June 27. Analysts surveyed by Platts forecast an increase of between 99 billion cubic feet and 103 billion cubic feet.August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 -0.86%  rose 5 cents, or 1.1%, to $4.41 per million British thermal units.Why commodities belong in your retirement portfolioAs Dow tops 17,000, worries about valuation riseJuly 4th gas prices highest since 2008 thanks to Iraq	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=1410E60A-02A8-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Natural-gas prices move higher after EIA data	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Natural-gas futures on Thursday turned higher after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that supplies of natural gas rose 100 billion cubic feet for the week ended June 27. Analysts surveyed by Platts forecast an increase of between 99 billion cubic feet and 103 billion cubic feet. Total stocks now stand at 1.929 trillion cubic feet, down 666 billion cubic feet from a year ago and 790 billion cubic feet below the five-year average, the government said. August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 -0.86% was at $4.40 per million British thermal units, up 4 cents, or 1%.

Rich Americans paying extra for VIP view of fireworks	By Charles Passy, MarketWatchBut this year, a number of Americans will be doing their partying in VIP-style. That’s right: Even this most fair-minded and fun of holidays has gone glam.In cities from New York to Florida to California, July 4th event organizers, including municipalities and nonprofit groups, are setting up VIP sections that offer patrons better access, preferred parking, as well as drinks and food. And that’s on top of the packages that private tour operators and hotels are putting together.In some cases, the VIP price tag is not that significant. In West Palm Beach, Fla.., the city charges $25 for a Club 4th package to attend its downtown fireworks display. (Among the package’s perks are two complimentary alcoholic beverages and the chance to cool your heels in an air-conditioned space.) But in other instances, the cost has headed into quadruple-digit territory: Consider the Platinum package offered last year by Three Sixty, a St. Louis rooftop bar, to tie in with the city’s big fireworks display. It ran $1,500-plus, which covered provisions for up to 10 patrons — tax and gratuity not included. Bar sales manager Amber Brda says the price was right because of the venue’s special location.“It’s like you can almost touch the fireworks from up here,” she says. (The bar is not offering the package in 2014 only because the city has moved the fireworks to a different area, Brda adds)It’s no secret as to why there’s been a big VIP push on Independence Day, say those who are promoting the packages. Fourth of July events attract crowds in the tens — even hundreds — of thousands. In fact, the New York fireworks display, sponsored by Macy’s, sees attendance in the millions. All that elbowing for position naturally makes some attendees eager to find a hassle-free solution. And businesses are more than happy to comply — if anything, offering VIP ticketing or services has become, almost ironically, fairly mainstream. Even the local bowling alley may now have a VIP lane .Plus, with cities and nonprofits, there’s the fact that fireworks displays cost money to produce — during the height of the Great Recession, some cities had to curtail the festivities altogether -- and VIP revenue can help offset the expenses.“There are so many things we have to pay for. We’re not a charity,” says Bernie Keisling, director of the Central PA 4th Fest, held at Penn State University. The nonprofit festival sells VIP viewing passes, with closer access, for $25 apiece. A VIP package, with four passes plus preferred parking, goes for $100.Still, not all of this sits well with Fourth of July traditionalists, who see the holiday as one that must adhere to the very values of equality on which this country was founded.“It should be about people coming together. It should be about family and community. It should not be about expensive ways to watch the fireworks,” says Chris Edwards, an economic analyst with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.The issue has come up before. In 2012, New York City officials voiced disappointment that a fundraising group connected to one of the city’s parks sold premium seats — at $200 apiece -- for viewing the Fourth of July Macy’s-sponsored fireworks; the group countered that there were still plenty of viewing areas open to the public for free.That’s also the argument that City of West Palm Beach community events manager Mary Pinak makes. As she explains, as many as 100,000 local residents are expected to attend the Fourth of July fireworks and festivities in her city for free, so the 275 who chose to pay the $25 for the Club 4th VIP section are hardly getting in anyone’s way.Plus, Pinak considers $25 to be a relative bargain, especially if you factor in the food and drinks included in the price. And if nothing else, she says, “there are nice bathrooms” in the VIP area.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=160B95D8-0229-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

The payrolls report is right, and GDP isn’t	By Rex Nutting, MarketWatchYou could be excused for thinking it did. After all, gross domestic product plunged at a 2.9% annualized rate in the first three months of the year, according to the government’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.Which means that, even if GDP rebounds at a 3.2% rate in the second quarter, as expected, the level of real GDP at the end of June would be scarcely higher than it was in December.Two quarters of essentially no growth sounds a lot like a recession. Should we be worried?Not at all. Almost certainly we are not in a recession, nor are we heading into one soon. How do we know? Because all of the other economic data we have — and we have a lot of data from a lot of different sources — disagrees with the GDP report.None of the other important data show more than a dip in December and January due to extremely cold and stormy weather. All of the other data reveal an economy that’s moving ahead at a modest pace.Let’s look at the four major monthly indicators that are used to judge whether the economy is in a recession: Payrolls are rising at a 1.9% pace so far this year, real incomes are rising at a 2.5% rate, industrial output is rising at a 5% pace, and real business sales are rising at a 1.8% rate.If I have a job, and my income is rising, and my company is producing more and selling more, what do I care if GDP fell? Is the GDP giving us any valuable information?Not really.“If the quarterly GDP figures are surprising in light of the behavior of the rest of the economic data, then GDP should be ignored,” economist Lou Crandall of Wrightson ICAP has written. “And if the GDP estimates are not surprising in light of the rest of the data, they have added no new information.”We should just ignore the quarterly GDP report altogether. The Fed does. Smart investors do too. It would be best if the government just stopped releasing quarterly GDP estimates, and instead put the time and effort into collecting other data, such as real-time information about the huge service sector of the economy that is largely opaque.Counting up the production and sales of everything produced in the United States is an almost impossible task, and the BEA does the best it can. The BEA can use tax returns and other annual reports and surveys to cross-check its assumptions, extrapolations, calculations and interconnections.But there is no way for the BEA to double-check its quarterly assumptions. One tiny miscalculation can be magnified and multiplied as the national income accounts are built up, piece by piece. Usually, those tiny errors will mostly offset one another, but sometimes they don’t.Sometimes you get a GDP report that doesn’t jibe at all with reality.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5AF42A2C-021D-11E4-8F8A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

30-year-mortgage rate nudges down to 4.12%	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 4.12% in the week that ended July 3 from 4.14% in the prior week, according to a Thursday report from federally controlled mortgage-buyer Freddie Mac /quotes/zigman/226335/delayed/quotes/nls/fmcc FMCC +0.77% . A year ago, the 30-year rate was at 4.29%. Mortgage rates were little changed from the previous week and remain below levels seen the same time last year, which should provide some help with homebuyer affordability in many markets, said Frank Nothaft, Freddies chief economist. The average rate for the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was unchanged at 3.22% in the latest week. Meanwhile, the rate for a 5-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage was also unchanged, remaining at 2.98%. The rate for a 1-year Treasury-indexed ARM fell to 2.38% from 2.40%.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=22E71E7E-F9C1-4105-9897-EFE32D6A4072&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Critics ravage Broadway audiences	By Quentin Fottrell, MarketWatchWhen it comes to acting in a respectable manner, theater professionals say many theater audiences have lost the plot. If marquees were emblazoned with critics’ opinions of audiences, they might read something like, “The spotlight is meant to be on the stage — not on you!” or “Balconies are for serenading — not for vomiting.”The latest case of a theatergoer upstaging the cast members played out recently at a performance of “Cabaret” at Studio 54, starring Alan Cumming and Michelle Williams. Movie actor Shia LaBeouf, 28, was arrested outside the theater after disrupting the performance. Security guards asked LaBeouf to leave at intermission after he allegedly yelled obscenities during Act I; he was then arrested by the police. He was released from police custody the following day.The rough and tumble in the audience sometimes resembles the action sequences in the musical “Rocky.” “The behavior of patrons has greatly deteriorated over the last five to 10 years,” says Suzy Ziller, a freelance theater producer in Pittsburgh. At a 2012 performance of “Bring it On” in New York, she says, a group of teenage girls were taking selfies during the show. “People act like they’re at home in their living rooms,” adds Paul Bongiorno, president of Starvox Booking, a South Orange, N.J.-based talent agency.Ushers are starting to act more like air stewards, standing over patrons until they turn off their phones, says Robert Hickey, the New York-based deputy director at the Protocol School of Washington, who recently attended “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” starring television star Neil Patrick Harris at the Belasco Theatre. “They are really starting to get more active and enforce their house rules,” he says.Hickey says many audiences need the attention. At Disney’s “Aladdin” at the New Amsterdam Theatre, he says, one woman gasped and exclaimed, “Did you see that? That reminds me of the time…” and proceeded to tell her friend a story, in tones well above a whisper.Incidents appear to be on the rise. In 2012, a patron projectile-vomited over the balcony during “Grace,” starring Paul Rudd at the Cort Theater. During a 2009 performance of “Gypsy,” Patti LuPone broke the “fourth wall” by confronting a patron who was snapping a photo. This year, a fan called out “I love you, Neil” at Harris, who yelled back, “I’m doing something up here, mother******!” Harris, who is playing an outrageous German transsexual punk rocker, later said his response was in character.Cellphones and noisy candy wrappers arent the only problem. Patrons have no reticence about getting up for a rest room break whenever they please or using a flashlight app to read a program mid-show, Hickey says. “Theater managers want you to be relaxed and not intimidated, but patrons either don’t know the etiquette or don’t care,” says Bongiorno.To be fair, big-name stars in live productions attract people who may not be used to going to the theater, says Hickey. Movie actors such as James Franco in “Of Mice and Men” and television actors such as Bryan Cranston in “All the Way” are a big pull for audiences, he adds. Another more practical issue: A multiplex regular may not be used to the small legroom in an old Broadway theater and may need to stretch his or her legs, Hickey says.Kevin Williamson, theater critic for National Review, says that the steadily rising price of theater tickets may give theatergoers “a sense of entitlement.” Theatergoers paid an average of $97 for the last season, according to the Broadway League, the trade association of theater owners and producers.Last year, Williamson lost his cool with a woman who was actually chatting on her cellphone during “Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812,” a musical adaptation of part of the novel “War and Peace.” She refused to stop talking, he says, so he grabbed her phone and threw it out the door. “She stood up and slapped me,” he recalls. “She stormed off through the middle of the stage [the audience was seated in the round] and out the back door. To walk right through the middle of the production was pretty self-involved.”Not all patrons are to blame. The most poignant moment in one 2010 performance of “A Little Night Music”—Desirée Armfeldt’s (Bernadette Peters) rendition of “Send in the Clowns”—was pierced by a child in the balcony screaming that he wanted to go home. In this case, though, the interruption might have been expected: To allow parents to take their noisy children to a play, the Broadway League offers an annual night when kids age 6 to 8 can see a participating Broadway show free with an adult.Others act like they’re at a rock concert. There was a sea of smartphones held aloft as people videotaped a key soliloquy of “Of Mice and Men,” with Franco and Chris O’Dowd at the Longacre Theatre, Williamson says. During “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” the short-lived play at the Cort Theatre last year, “it was like the red carpet on Oscar night” as patrons used their smartphones to snap photos during a brief nude scene featuring “Game of Thrones” star Emilia Clarke.There’s been a general relaxing of social mores by the theaters themselves as well, as they focus on selling T-shirts, candy, beer, popcorn and other souvenirs, says theater producer Elizabeth McCann. “There was a time when nothing was served in theater,” she says. “It’s becoming a little carnival-like…Obviously it’s about moneymaking, but is this the best thing that people should be doing in the theater? Going inside a theater is like going to Macy’s basement.”Also see:10 things Broadway won’t tell you	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F8074452-FE44-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Sawyer hands off No. 1 spot to ‘Brad Pitt of TV news’	By Jon Friedman, MarketWatchMuir will officially succeed Diane Sawyer, who is stepping down but remaining with ABC News in high-profile positions, on Sept. 2. As Disney’s /quotes/zigman/245568/delayed/quotes/nls/dis DIS +0.46%  ABC tries to dominate network news, Muir, who prominently anchored ABC’s evening-news efforts on the weekends, has emerged as its metaphorical Great White Hope.ABC is excited about Muir’s potential because the network believes he can grab the attention of the American public. ABC is betting that Muir can leapfrog over Brian Williams of Comcast’s /quotes/zigman/89307/delayed/quotes/nls/cmcsa CMCSA +0.63%  NBC and become the new face of television journalism.Muir, 40, is younger than Williams, 55, in an industry where someone’s youth — or more crucially, youthful image — counts for a lot. Heck, some pundits might go so far as to joke that Brian Williams is no longer even the hottest TV star in his own family, as his charismatic actress-daughter Allison has become a fan favorite on the highly successful HBO show “Girls.”But what about Muir? Can he become a game-changer?Can Muir be witty and irreverent on a nightly basis? Can he prompt viewers and critics to talk about him , and not merely the news on his show? Will “Saturday Night Live” bestow the ultimate popular-culture compliment on Muir by lampooning his quirks and mannerisms?Can he persuade viewers that his brand of news is more informative and entertaining than the other guys’? Can he become destination viewing for news junkies?The decision underscores ABC’s continuing drive to be recognized far and wide as America’s favorite news network. ABC has made serious inroads to challenge NBC’s perennial domination on the three major fronts: during weekday evenings, Monday-to-Friday breakfast-hour shows and on Sunday mornings.ABC has evidently concluded that a younger anchor — the well-liked Diane Sawyer is 68 years old — may spark more interest from a larger number of younger viewers. The name of the game in broadcasting is “youth.” The networks want to project to the world a more youthful image so it can woo the kinds of viewers — 18-34, to be specific — that Madison Avenue covets. It’s all about the promise of those advertising dollars to come. And in Muir, known as the “Brad Pitt of TV news” because of his good American looks, ABC has just the vehicle.Meanwhile, NBC rolls its collective eyes at the suggestion that Williams might be vulnerable in the network ratings and points to his continuing robust TV ratings. (NBC also bristles at the suggestion that Williams has sold his soul to the devil, as I recently suggested, to attract a broader audience.)Even though evening-news network broadcasts continue to draw in millions of eyeballs, everyone bemoans the state of the industry for CBS /quotes/zigman/393390/delayed/quotes/nls/cbs CBS 0.00% , NBC and ABC. Fewer people are watching at 6:30 p.m. than they used to, turning instead to the Internet, cable TV and video games.Young people prefer to get the word in biting, sarcastic force from the likes of Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Bill Maher — smart, hugely entertaining news commentators who, even though they are entertainers, are now taken seriously as breaking-news pundits and taste-makers.What do evening-news anchors stand for anymore? They try hard to show that they care about viewers and their problems. They want us to know that they understand the situation in Iraq. They’d like us to believe that President Barack Obama takes them very seriously as national taste-makers.Yes, the television networks cover the same stories night after night. Yes, the anchors tend to be indistinguishable because they say the same things. And in a resounding “no,” younger viewers don’t want to get their news at 6:30 p.m. any longer.Still, Sawyer’s “World News” show emerged victorious in the May sweeps period among the coveted 25-54 demographic, representing ABC’s first sweeps win in more than six years, the network pointed out in its press release to announce Muir’s ascent .In the season to date, “World News” has gained total viewers and the 25-54 age range from a year ago. ABC noted that it had its most-watched season in five years.Meanwhile, ABC News is also making progress in other key areas. In the competition among the weekday morning news broadcasts, its “Good Morning America” program stands as the No. 1 breakfast-hour show for the second consecutive year in total viewers and among the 25-54 demographic. Further, “This Week” on Sunday mornings is having its best performance in five years and it won the May sweep in the 25-54 age group, its first sweeps win in that demographic in nearly 21 years.Now, it will get interesting. ABC is at a crossroads at 6:30. Either it will continue to make gains against NBC (and CBS) or it will backslide. It is a measured risk to bring on a new anchor at a time when the ABC evening news has been making progress. Plus, Muir will surely have to bring his “A” game as NBC, a wounded and hungry rival, will provide vigorous competition.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CE204D76-023D-11E4-8F8A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03
Where do U.S. soccer and its fans go from here?	By Matthew FuttermanThat’s about where the American sports public finds itself after its 20-day fling with a U.S. World Cup team that, while not particularly skilled, managed to represent a lot of traits Americans love. They were fearless. They were willing to suffer and fight to the end. They embraced anyone, no matter where they were from, as long as they held those athletic truths to be self-evident.Now this relationship has reached the moment when we need to talk.America, are you all in?If you are, the timing couldn’t be better. Usually when the U.S. gets knocked out of the World Cup, as it did in Tuesday’s 2-1 Round of 16 loss to Belgium, it’s staring at a long four years for another set of truly meaningful games. Not this time. The next three summers will undoubtedly be the best World Cup interregnum ever.Next summer brings the Gold Cup, the confederation championship for North and Central America and the Caribbean that carries the chance to solidify a spot in the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia, the dress rehearsal for the 2018 World Cup. There’s also the 2015 Women’s World Cup in Canada, a tournament the U.S. should win.In 2016, the Copa America, South America’s continental championship, comes to the U.S., giving the national team a chance to take on the likes of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay in meaningful games on home soil. That summer should also bring an under-23 team (plus three designated older players) back to Brazil for the Rio Olympics. Then 2017 should bring the Confederations Cup, and 2018 the World Cup. There’s a lot of fun to be had here.Like all relationships, though, it’s going to take serious commitment and a leap of faith to build a foundation for long-term success — and a lot of that won’t feel anything like the thrilling past three weeks.The U.S. needs to find or create more players who have both the skills to hold the ball and the athletic talent to blow by opponents with speed and strength.Take a close look at the Ghana’s Asamoah Gyan and Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku, the two players who scored the deciding goals that sent the U.S. home the past two World Cups. They did it by overwhelming American defenders. It’s a safe bet that with their speed and brute strength, Gyan and Lukaku would have ended up as NFL wide receivers had they grown up in the States. Does anyone doubt that some great wide-receiver prospect out there could have been a wondrous soccer player?A nation that aspires to be at the pinnacle of the world’s most popular sport has to commit its best athletes to the cause. Julian Green, the 19-year-old German-American who scored moments after stepping on the field Tuesday night, and DeAndre Yedlin, the 20-year Seattle Sounder, look skilled, talented and hungry.Both need to get stronger. They need company, too, no matter where it can be found — even mighty Germany has players who are Turkish, Polish and Ghanaian — but some of it needs to come from Florida, Texas, Southern California and New Jersey.And developing great American players doesn’t mean having kids join travel teams and academies at an early age. It means creating a culture where kids have a soccer ball at their feet in every spare moment — at lunchtime in the schoolyard, after school in the park, in organized practices but, just as importantly, in pickup games in the playground, where true creativity flourishes.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.MarketWatch must-read: There’s only World Cup team left to root for	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=301E4596-02B1-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03
Hurricane Arthur set to hit east coast all the way to Boston	By Karishma MehrotraForecasters expect Arthur to whip past the North Carolina’s Outer Banks on Friday without making landfall, the Associated Press reported.The National Hurricane Center predicted Arthur would swipe the coast early Friday with winds of up to 85 mph. The storm would be off the coast of New England later Friday and eventually make landfall in Canada’s maritime provinces as a tropical storm, the Hurricane Center predicted, according to AP.Many business owners, residents and visitors prepared for the storm, which is expected to pelt North Carolina’s beaches at one of the busiest times of the year. Some communities canceled fireworks, picnics and other festivities as the National Weather Service issued a hurricane warning stretching from Surf City on North Carolina’s southeastern coast to Duck, in the Outer Banks.

The stock catapulted 75% on Wednesday, on more than six-times the average daily volume, after the ruling was announced. Meanwhile, the stock is still trading below the May 1 close of $9.82, just before Doral said it was developing a revised capital plan to remain in compliance with regulators. Given Dorals tax dispute with the Puerto Rico government, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had said Doral couldnt include those tax receivables as part of Tier 1 capital.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9C3AB400-DDD4-4215-A748-5B53D16C4375&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Trade gap drops 5.6% in May as exports rise	By Jeffry Bartash, MarketWatchThe trade gap declined to a seasonally adjusted $44.4 billion in May from a slightly revised $47.0 billion in the prior month, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The deficit in April was the highest in nearly two years.Exports rose 1% to a record $195.5 billion, driven by higher outbound shipments of autos and parts, petroleum and related products, and fish. Exports to Canada hit a record $27.4 billion.Imports dipped 0.3% to $239.8 billion as demand for foreign oil dropped to the lowest level since November 2010. The daily average of crude oil imports fell to the lowest in 18 years.The U.S. has sharply boosted domestic production of oil and natural gas owing to technological advances that have opened up new areas for drilling. That’s reducing demand for foreign energy sources.A smaller trade deficit is a generally positive for a nation’s economic well-being. Higher sales of American goods and services overseas or fewer purchases of foreign-made products boost domestic profits and create more jobs at home.The deficit in May, however, was just a touch lower compared to one year ago. And it’s 24% higher than a five-year low of $35.9 billion reached in November.The U.S. trade deficit with China rose to $28.8 billion in May from $27.3 billion in the prior month. The trade gap with the European Union, however, dropped to $12.3 billion from $14 billion. Country data is not seasonally adjusted.Also read: U.S. sees another boom in jobs in June	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=44773952-021C-11E4-8F8A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

U.S. jobless claims edge up to 315,000, layoffs low	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The number of people who applied for U.S. unemployment benefits rose by 2,000 to 315,000 in the week ended June 28, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expected claims to total 314,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis. Jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, have been hovering near a postrecession low for several months. The average of new claims over the past four weeks, meanwhile, edged up by 500 to 315,000. The monthly figure smooths out the jumpiness in the weekly data and offers a better look at underlying trends in the labor market. Also, the government said continuing claims increased by11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 2.58 million in the week ended June 21. Continuing claims reflect the number of people already receiving benefits. Initial claims from two weeks ago were revised up to 313,000 from 312,000.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5AC7CD1F-EFE5-45F8-A140-C68FD7ED129B&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

U.S. gains 288,000 jobs in June; unemployment 6.1%	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The U.S. added 288,000 jobs in June and the unemployment rate fell to a nearly six-year low of 6.1% as more people entered the labor force and found work, the government reported Thursday. The strong jobs report suggests the economy is gaining momentum and could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than it had planned unless growth cools off. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected an increase of 215,000 nonfarm jobs. Employment gains for May and April were also revised up by a combined 29,000, the Labor Department said. In June, virtually every major industry added jobs, led by professional services, retail, restaurants, health care, finance and manufacturing. Average hourly wages, meanwhile, rose 6 cents, or 0.2% to $24.45. Wages are up 2% over the past 12 months. The average workweek was unchanged at 34.5 hours. The labor-force participation rate was also flat at 62.8%. The government said 224,000 new jobs were created in May, up from a preliminary 217,000, based on newly available data. Aprils gain was revised up to 304,000 from 282,000, marking the biggest increase in jobs in two and a half years. So far in 2014 the economy has gained an average of 231,000 jobs a month, 19% faster than the 2013 pace of 194,000.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=2468DAC3-DA3E-49D5-B681-800E7748D009&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Foreign banks exposure to China port fraud may top $500 million	By Enda Curran, Daniel Inman and Ira IosebashviliIndustry executives believe Chinese banks could be on the hook for more, with estimates running into the billions of dollars if the loans backed by the fraudulent use of Qingdao-based metals as collateral go bad.The sum highlights the potentially sizable losses that some banks would face if Chinese traders that fraudulently use the same copper and aluminum as collateral to obtain loans default on the commodity-backed loans. Chinese authorities are currently investigating whether the same stockpile of metals was used to secure multiple loans. Western banks, meanwhile, have been shut out of warehouses in both Qingdao and Penglai, both in Shandong province, and are struggling to gauge how much of the metals-backed loans they have made have been fraudulent and could be at risk of default.The estimates for exposures covers all of the warehouses at Qingdao port, but so far the probe has focused on Dagang, a smaller unit at the port. The worry for bankers is that the potential fraud may be found to be more widespread at Qingdao or elsewhere according to banking executives familiar with the matter.Standard Chartered Bank /quotes/zigman/22532/delayed UK:STAN -0.41%   disclosed a $250 million exposure to Qingdao last week, though Chief Executive Peter Sands told reporters at that time that the amount isn’t “material at this stage” and is “across multiple clients, multiple exposures and multiple facilities.”Other foreign banks that have exposure to Qingdao are Dutch bank ABN Amro Bank NV, French banks BNP Paribas SA /quotes/zigman/132292/delayed FR:BNP -2.05%   and Natixis /quotes/zigman/163752/delayed FR:KN -2.43%  , South Africa’s Standard Bank PLC ZA:SBK +0.34%  , and U.S. bank Citigroup /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C +0.48%  , people familiar with the matter said. Apart from Standard Chartered, lenders including Citigroup and Standard Bank have previously acknowledged potential problems with commodity financing in China but have given no further details.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.<STRONG>More must-reads from MarketWatch:</STRONG>How the jobs report could disrupt the market’s snoozeHow McDonald’s ‘worst’ burgers may be hurting the stockThe Great Obama Bull Market will roar until 2016	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E93DB554-02A5-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

These shares pay a different kind of dividend	By Caitlin HustonRustrum, co-author of the book, “It’s a Shareable Life,” is one of a growing number of people participating in the sharing economy, also known as collaborative consumption, which is generally defined as the sharing of goods and resources.The sharing movement took off after the economy tanked around 2008; but now, thanks to technology, continuing economic struggles, and an openness to sharing among younger people, it’s growing rapidly. Imran Sayeed, a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, estimates that the sharing economy will make about $5 billion in gross receipts in 2014 — a number he says will likely double or even triple in the next two years.While the emergence of startups like RelayRides and Airbnb has been well-documented, depending on who you ask, the sharing movement can include social networks or initiatives like New York’s Citi Bikes. But there are a few things that are generally agreed upon: you can make money by sharing what you own, cut your costs by sharing things that you need but don’t own, and, to capitalize, you should be open to new experiences.As for Rustrum, she posted about her car on Twitter and Facebook, saying, “Anyone in SF want to borrow my car for the next 6 days?” She didn’t ask for any payment, but requested a ride to the airport that day and to be picked up when she returned.“I feel better about my stuff not being idle or unused,” Rustrum said.Established brands are following startups into the sharing economy. For example, Patagonia partnered with eBay /quotes/zigman/76117/delayed/quotes/nls/ebay EBAY +0.77%   to create a marketplace for the brand’s pre-owned clothing, and Walgreens /quotes/zigman/245520/delayed/quotes/nls/wag WAG +1.29%   partnered with TaskRabbit, an online marketplace for outsourcing chores, to deliver medicine during this year’s winter flu season.For purists in the space, it’s about meeting new people and constructing a mutually beneficial relationship. “It’s re-embedding society into economics,” says Neal Gorenflo, co-founder of Shareable, a non-profit sharing economy website.From 2011 to 2012, Gorenflo conducted 30 of what he calls “experiments in sharing,” including creating a child-care co-op, sharing rides and starting a neighborhood tool library. His family saved $17,000 during that year, mostly due to child-care savings.His experiment is over, but he continues to promote and live in the sharing economy by working at a co-working space, which offers meeting space, education and networking opportunities, and by using services such as GetAround, a marketplace for individuals to rent out their cars, and Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending company, for investing.To get started in the sharing economy, Gorenflo suggests figuring out your biggest expenses — often housing or transportation — and finding solutions to cut them down.“Finding a way to go car-free or car-lite is a good place to start,” Gorenflo said.Joining the sharing economy is also made easier if you live in a co-living space, where housemates share meals and transportation, because then sharing is integrated into your life, says Rustrum. She has lived in several co-living houses and also spent months couch surfing in Europe.While sharing-based startups make participation easier in large cities, Gorenflo says the sharing economy exists across the U.S. in the form of communal farming and telephone and electricity co-ops.Rustrum also uses sharing economy platforms such as Couchsurfing to offer her couch to guests, and she goes to clothing swaps and shares rides on Craigslist. Before she shares a ride or allows someone to stay with her, Rustrum said she researches the person online.“We have a mutual friend at the very least, or if that’s not true, they’re highly Google-able,” Rustrum said.That kind of transaction is the truly disruptive part of the sharing economy, says Philip Evans, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group. Consumers are now trusting strangers and sharing goods based on their online reputations, rather than on an established trust between acquaintances, he said.And while he believes the sharing economy will continue to grow — with the exception of old-fashioned customs like in-person clothing swaps — Evans said it will involve a lot of trial and error as users may encounter scams and platforms respond in kind by beefing up their security measures.“What we will clearly see is a lot more attempts to make this kind of thing work,” Evans said.When she offered her car to the stranger found via social media, Rustrum said the driver received a parking ticket. However, the driver paid for it, Rustrum said. Otherwise, when she’s lent her car out to friends or used services like FlightCar, she said she has not had many problems.You also have to pay attention to the details on the receiving end of the services, says Odile Beniflah, who works as marketing manager for a European ride-sharing company. Beniflah said she failed to notice that an Airbnb stay in Turkey allowed smoking and thus she and her family had to deal with strong odors during their vacation.“You don’t really have bad experiences, but you have experiences where you think, ‘Next time I’ll do it better,’” Beniflah said.Caitlin Huston is a freelance writer with a focus on startups and small businesses .More from MarketWatch:How to fly on a private plane for under $200 a person10 things Generation X won’t tell youWhere has 99% of the ocean’s trash gone?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=210B50C8-0165-11E4-8470-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03
Planned layoffs drop in June: Challenger		/news/planned-layoffs-drop-june-challenger-113000943.html	2014-07-03
The Great Obama Bull Market will roar till 2016	By Paul B. Farrell, MarketWatchFolks, this stock market has been roaring since March 2009 when the DJIA bottomed at 6,547, a painful 53.9% drop from the October 2007 high of 14,164 during the Wall Street bank credit crash in Bush’s last year as president. The S&P 500 also bottomed, at 676, a 56.6% drop.However, since March 2009 the stock market has been steadily climbing. Over five years. And the DJIA’s made a remarkable recovery, to just under its next big milestone, 17,000. While the S&P500 is nearing 2,000, headed up. Yes, market gains over 250% ... and still climbing!So what can we expect from the stock market by 2016 and the election of the next American president? More! Fabulous 250% gains so far. And bigger gains possible coming in the next couple years till we elect a new president. Maybe over 300%. Gains likely to favor a Democrat.Get it? GOP conservatives may have been successful in slowing America’s economic recovery. But the stock market is actually getting surprisingly stronger from this political war. With every Obama progressive move — Obamacare, ERA regulations, equal pay for women, gay rights, minimum wages, stem-cell research, immigration, Osama bin Laden, deficit cuts and so much more — GOP conservatives and the tea party learn little, only hear enough for another attack on Obama, offer no solutions, just opposition.But the bull market keeps roaring and roaring. Get it? As the war against all-things-Obama accelerates, as the economic recovery slows, as the GOP fights infrastructure funding, as they fail to pass jobs stimulus programs ... the stock market gets stronger, roars bullishly ahead.No matter how self-destructive conservative opposition gets, demographic trends are also rapidly diminishing the power of the party of “angry white men,” as GOP Sen. Lindsay Graham calls it, further fragmenting his party, spotlighting the lack of a strong presidential candidate, and, paradoxically, increasing the prospects of a Hillary Clinton election.But still, in spite of the intense ideological war, if all the experts predictions are on target with another 30% in the Dow and the S&P500 rising to 2,250, Wall Street and Main Street investors could see a remarkable 300%-plus gain by the next presidential election.Check out these predictions: “Expect a 30% gain before the bull market ends,” is the headline prediction of Decision Economics CEO Allen Sinai in Bottomline Personal. He sees 18,500 on the Dow in 2014. And ahead we don’t even “need a robust 4%-to-5% GDP to keep the bull market going,” echoing the bullish forecasts of other forecasters, like Nouriel Roubini and Merrill Lynch strategist Michael Hartnett who also see a roaring bull till 2017.And in “Best Guesses for the Next Two Years,” one of America’s more accurate market forecasters, Jeremy Grantham, strategist and founder of the $117 billion GMO money team writes: “This year should continue to be difficult.” But after October “the market is likely to be strong, especially through April and by then or in the following 18 months up to the next election (or, horrible possibility, even longer) will have rallied past 2,250, perhaps by a decent margin.”Grantham’s wrap-up: “then around the election or soon after, the market bubble will burst, as bubbles always do, and will revert to its trend value, around half of its peak or worse, depending on what new ammunition the Fed can dig up.” Yes, Grantham is predicting a possible market collapse from a seven-year long bull market. Meanwhile, enjoy a couple more great years, and protect yourself for later.Grantham admits a black swan could stop the bull early. But his bottom line is clear: The bull “will not end for at least a year or two and probably not before it reaches a level in excess of 2,250 on the S&P 500.” But while it will “end badly ... given this regime of the Federal Reserve and given the levels of excess at other market peaks, I think it would be difficult to end this bull market just yet.” So the bull will just keep roaring to more records.OK, so maybe you don’t believe him, it does sound too good to be true. Well, run the numbers yourself. The fact is, this bull market did start at 6,547, in the doldrums of the 2009 recession. And it’s predicted to just keep roaring, even adding another 30% on top of the current near-record DJIA pushing 17,000. And assuming no black swans, that could put the benchmark DJIA roaring all the way up around 22,000 by the time we vote on a new president in November 2016. Yes, let’s all celebrate.Yes, folks, you are seeing a rare historical event, two bulls back-to-back, end-on-end with no real bear market in between. Yes, rare, over the past century, says IBD Publisher Bill O’Neil in his classic, “How to Make Money in Stocks,” the average bull cycle runs up for an average of 3.75 years, then falls into a bear for an average nine months.Today Wall Street stocks are climbing a wall of worry. A similar event happened in the 2002-2008 bull run. P/E ratios were so high in 2004 Wall Street panicked. The market ignored it, barely paused on its six-year bull run till its 14,164 peak in late 2007.This time, there’s also no real bear break between two bull runs. The Great Obama Bull Market took off in early 2009 and just keeps roaring. We reported on how Gross, Roubini and many gurus apparently thought the IBD/O’Neil data meant the market was headed down in 2013. But like 2004, it didn’t drop. Now, both the market and economy could just keep roaring till the 2016 presidential elections. That’s over seven years with a potential bull gain of 300%-plus.So, yes, in spite of the relentless GOP opposition, the attacks, legislative gridlock, economic headwinds, and global macroeconomic land mines put in his path, in spite of the ever-possible, unpredictable black swan, the Great Obama Seven-Year Bull Market, as financial history books will likely call it, may just keep thriving, overcoming obstacles, and roaring ahead predictably, hopefully till the next presidential election on November 3, 2016.And that label will stick no matter who gets elected the next president: From the Democrats corner, the current frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, whose “Hard Choices” book tour has launched her campaign, who is clear choice of the majority of American women who believe it’s time for a woman president, and whose resolve now has the added incentive of the conservative Hobby Lobby attack on women’s reproductive rights.Bottom line: the legacy of this long bull run would also be locked in financial history even if a Republican becomes president — whether a loyalist like Jeb Bush, Chris Christie or Mitt Romney again. Even if the tea party takes over the GOP and nominate a favorite like Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio or Rand Paul and they defeat Hillary Clinton. No matter how much conservatives will forever hate to admit it, if the Great Obama Bull Market keeps roaring till 2016, it deserves a chapter in the history books.Celebrate the birth of our great nation ... a bull run till 2016 ... the Dow roaring to 22,000!	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3DC8094E-020B-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03
Euro-zone PMI falls; Germany, Spain post slowdowns	By Paul HannonFigures also released Thursday showed retail sales across the 18 countries that share the euro were flat in May, while figures for April were revised to show a decline in sales, having previously recorded a slight rise.Data firm Markit Thursday said its composite purchasing managers index for the euro zone — which measures activity across both the manufacturing and services sectors — fell to 52.8 from 53.5 in May. The PMI is based on a survey of around 5,000 companies across the currency area.That indicates private sector activity slowed for the second straight month, and raises questions about whether the return to growth that began in the second quarter of last year will be sustained.The surveys were released as members of the European Central Bank’s governing council gathered in Frankfurt, a meeting that most economists expect to conclude without the announcement of any new measures to boost growth and inflation. In June, the governing council agreed cuts to its main interest rates, and fresh funding for banks linked to their lending to businesses.However, the euro zone’s annual rate of inflation remained at 0.5% in June, well below the ECB’s target of just below 2.0%. And with economic data and surveys indicating that economic growth remained meager in the second quarter, many economists believe the ECB will consider further stimulus measures later this year, possibly including asset purchases of the kind employed by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.Although the surveys will worry policy makers, there were some signs that activity will pick up in coming months, with new orders rising at the fastest pace for three years.Signs of a revival in Italy will also encourage policy makers, including Mario Draghi, the Italian who heads the ECB. Largely driven by its services sector, the country’s composite PMI rose to 54.2, its highest level for 38 months.However, the surveys revealed that businesses once again cuts their prices, albeit at a slower pace than previously, an indication that the annual rate of inflation is unlikely to pick up significantly in coming months.“While pessimists will see the continuing fall in prices charged for goods and services as a further sign that the region is plagued by deflationary forces, optimists will note that fall in prices was only marginal and the smallest seen for over two years,” said Chris Willaimson, Markit’s chief economist.The pessimists will find support in the retail sales figures, which suggest consumer demand remained weak during the second quarter, an indication that businesses will find it difficult to raise their prices without risking a loss of custom.Williamson said that taken as a whole, the PMIs for the three months to June indicate that economic growth picked up to “perhaps” 0.4% from 0.2% in the first, having slowed from 0.3% in the final three months of last year.Figures also released Thursday showed Ireland’s economy returned to strong growth in the first three months of the year, having contracted in the previous quarter. The Central Statistics Office said the country’s gross domestic product increased 2.7% compared with the final three months of 2013, and by 4.1% from the first three months of that year.Driven by rising exports, Ireland’s economy easily outpaced those of its fellow euro-zone members, with Germany recording the next highest rate of growth at 0.8%.The country exited from its three-year bailout with the International Monetary Fund and European Union in December, but must continue to make budget cuts this year and next.In its First Post-Program Monitoring report released last month, the IMF said it expects Ireland’s economy to grow by 1.7% this year and by 2.4% in 2015, and urged the government to press ahead with 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in austerity measures for 2015.That would mark the country’s eighth year of austerity. Although the unemployment rate has been falling steadily over recent months, the cuts have left many Irish people struggling to make ends meet, and the CSO said consumer spending fell in the first quarter.More must-reads from MarketWatch:How the jobs report could disrupt the market snooze10 things that rich people know and you don’tFarrell: The Great Obama Bull Market will roar till 2016	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E6E1F686-0290-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

‘Transformers’ Bumblebee Camaro evolves	By Sam ThetardThe first three Transformers films helped to propel the Camaro to the sales crown in its segment. “Being a part of the ‘Transformers’ franchise is an incredible way to showcase the design work of which GM is capable,” says Ed Welburn, VP of GM Global Design /quotes/zigman/1466682/delayed/quotes/nls/gm GM 0.00%  . “The global series gets our cutting-edge designs in front of more potential customers than we could through traditional methods.”The first “Transformers” film featured a then-concept version of the fifth-generation Camaro, two years before its production. Body panels came from the same molds that made the 2006 Camaro Concept the previous year, and the body was placed on the chassis of a Holden. The later two films featured production versions of the Camaro, with the third film featuring an SS version and a light color change.“Transformers: Age of Extinction” features a heavily reworked Bumblebee with a more “aggressive and muscular” look, per the request of the film’s director Michael I-like-to-blow-things-up Bay. GM’s North Hollywood Design Center created Bumblebee’s new look.“Transformers: Age of Extinction,” from Paramount, is in theaters now, featuring explosions and at least one dino-bot.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=1743DB08-FC08-11E3-8AA5-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03
Caring for mom and dad? Take care of yourself, too	The position? Family caregiver.Family members provide an estimated $450 billion of unpaid care annually, according to the most recent estimates from AARP. Nearly 10 million adults over the age of 50 currently care for their aging parents, according to the MetLife Study of Caregiving Costs to Working Caregivers. “If tomorrow they all walked off the job, taxpayers couldn’t pick up the slack,” said Amy Gotwals, chief of public policy and external affairs at the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging.And yet, many members of this massive, unpaid workforce are themselves in need of care. The MetLife report estimates that, compared with non-caregivers, elder caregivers cost employers an additional 8%, or $13.4 billion annually, in health-care costs. “We’re seeing added stress, hypertension, diabetes, a lot of weight gain and depression,” said Stephanie Thompson, financial services representative with MetLife Premier Client Group in Downers Grove, Ill.Boomers (and increasingly, members of Generation X) are often so consumed with their responsibilities that they neglect visiting the doctor themselves, both for preventative care and when they’re feeling unwell, experts say. They also tend to forgo healthy habits such as exercise.And when folks do develop health ills, they often fail to connect them to what’s going on in their personal lives, said Jody Gastfriend, vice president of senior care for care.com, a company where people can search for elder, child, pet or home care and manage their care relationships.Part of the problem is that family caregivers often don’t identify themselves as such, not acknowledging to themselves and others that they’re doing important, difficult work that requires support. They see themselves as merely helping with shopping, cooking, cleaning, driving, and paying bills—to name just a few tasks—like any good son or daughter would.Juggling these responsibilities with paid employment can lead to burnout, experts say. Many workers don’t have the flexibility to take off work for several hours to accompany a parent to a doctor’s appointment, or to spend time on the phone with insurance companies. Even those who do might find themselves staying up late to finish all the work not accomplished during that interval.But quitting work isn’t always a good solution for caregivers, as lost wages can greatly impact their own retirement security. What’s more, leaving work can rob them of an important social and intellectual outlet.As natural as it may be to help parents who once took care of everything for you, caregivers neglect themselves at their peril, experts say. Your health and your bank account can suffer when you fail to heed troubling symptoms that could develop into a more severe illness if left untreated.To be sure, “saying you need to take care of yourself can be easy to say and hard to do,” said Beth Kallmyer, vice president of constituent services for the Alzheimer’s Association. People think no one will care for their loved one like they will, so they’re loath to take a break.Ultimately, one message that gets through to caregivers is that if something happens to them, the people they’re caring for will also suffer, Kallmyer said. Whether it’s depression or a thrown back—both common caregiver illnesses—if something’s hurting you, you can’t take the best possible care of your loved one.Here are ways to help manage the job:Support can come in many forms. Maybe it’s a sibling who lives far away but has offered to set up online bill-paying and handle insurance claims, or a retired neighbor who offers to sit with your mom for a few hours while you run errands or work out. Or maybe it’s a caregiver support group. Those caring for someone with Alzheimer’s disease, one of the most common causes of impairment in the elderly, can search for support groups on the Alzheimer’s Association website ( click here for more information ).	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A0C339F6-0215-11E4-8F8A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03
Beijing to build ‘wind passage’ to blow away smog	By Laura He, MarketWatchThe national and municipal governments’ respective weather bureaus are studying the feasibility of creating an “urban wind passage,” a Beijing News report Wednesday quoted a senior Beijing city environmental researcher, Liu Chunlan, as saying.The wind corridor would allow air from the suburbs to blow through the urban center and, hopefully, remove the air pollutants, Liu said.She said the city government is currently revising its urban planning to include specific details on the wind passage, which could be ready by the end of the year.Specifically, the planning department would control the density and height of buildings to channel air pollutants and urban heat and create room for them to disperse.Beijing may not be the only Chinese city considering this method to attack China’s nationwide air-quality problem. A number of major Chinese cities — including Shanghai, Hangzhou and Nanjing — have thought about the possibility of building such wind passages, Beijing News said.China’s Apple rival Xiaomi sees smartphone sales explodeJapan to lift some sanctions on North KoreaYellen: Rate policy needs to focus on jobs, not stability	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=601D4614-0272-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-03

Mr. Abe said he believed a committee named by Pyongyang to investigate the matter had the necessary authority.“Under the principle of matching action with action, Japan will lift a portion of its sanctions” on North Korea, Mr. Abe said.The sanctions to be lifted include travel restrictions, some controls on money transfers and a ban on port calls in Japan by North Korean ships.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.More must reads from MarketWatch :How the jobs report could disrupt the market’s snoozeThe only World Cup team left to root for10 things rich people know that you don’t	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A60F0012-025F-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

The only World Cup team left to root for	By Almar LatourNow that Team USA has exited the World Cup following a truly amazing performance, you may be tempted to stop watching the World Cup altogether as there is no one for whom to cheer.But there’s a remedy: You can throw your support behind another country. And let me be the first to suggest the fine nation of the Netherlands.Sure, Dutch people may be the object of Dr. Evil’s hatred in “Austin Powers.” But don’t write us off. We actually have a lot in common with Americans.For starters, our flags have the same colors, which means you don’t necessarily have to switch fan gear if you throw your support to the Netherlands. Our team may be dressed in orange, in honor of the Dutch royal family, the House of Orange, but you’ll notice little red, white and blue flags painted on faces and fingernails of Dutch soccer fans. So keep wearing your “bomb pop” jerseys and chant your new favorite soccer song: “Hup, Holland, hup.”Like you, the Netherlands have had fights with Belgians and lost. Granted, ours was in the 1830s, while yours was just yesterday. But we both had great defenders who ultimately could not save us from losing. Yours, of course, is the mighty Tim Howard, blocker of countless shots at his goal. Ours is Jan van Speijk, a Dutch naval officer, who, when confronted with hostile Belgians, decided to blow up his own gunboat in front of the Belgian city of Antwerp.But it’s not just our ultimately futile struggle against Belgians in our past that unites us. Our historic bonds run deep. After all, the Mayflower departed for the new continent from — you guessed it — the Netherlands.Perhaps it’s no coincidence that you mimic some of our age-old policies. For example, of late, Colorado appears to be turning into a little version of at least part of the Netherlands (with some notable differences: Our low country doesn’t have mountains or Maureen Dowd).Like the Netherlands or not, I think you can legally claim victory in any case if we win. Your grandparents freed our grandparents 60 years ago, so without you guys there would be no Dutch team. We won’t forget that.We sort of speak the same language. The Netherlands are practically Anglophone, but when we speak we mix in some throat clearing every other sentence to keep up the appearance of having our own language. Here are some quick language essentials that may come in handy with Dutch soccer: “Dat is geen duik” means, “That’s not a dive.”Just for your convenience, many Dutch soccer players come prepackaged with easy-to-remember names like “Wesley,” “Nigel,” “Daley” and, of course, “Memphis.”And before I forget: Linguists say that the word “Yankee” very likely derived from Dutch. Some say the word stems from “Janke,” or little Jan, once a common name in the Netherlands and in New Amsterdam. Others say it derived from “Jan-Kees,” a common first name. Either way, if you’re a Yankee, you’re practically Dutch already.Thank you for your consideration.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=30BD1E3C-0220-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

BBQ sticker shock: Beef prices climb 44%	By Catey Hill, MarketWatchBackyard barbecues have been slowly getting more expensive, even after adjusting for inflation, according to data released in late June by research firm Rabo AgriFinance. In the past 10 years, beef prices have climbed an inflation-adjusted 44%, pickles 19%, bread 16%, lettuce 11%, ice cream 4% and chips 3%. And all-in-all, the price of having your friends over and firing up the grill has climbed roughly 5% since the recession to an average of $66.82, the data revealed.What’s more, government data reveals that those are far from the only barbecue staples whose prices are creeping upwards. The latest CPI data shows that pork prices climbed 2.4% just from April to May and bacon in particular saw huge jumps, rising 5.1% over that period. Now, a pound of sliced bacon will set you back more than $6. The data also show big jumps in apple and citrus fruit prices, so you may want to make a little less of your famous fruit salad this year, as well as dessert staples like cookies, cakes and cupcakes.There are a variety of factors impacting food prices. Recent hikes in beef prices are due in part to small cattle herds and higher pork prices are thanks to a disease called PED that’s killing small pigs. Fruit and veggie prices were pushed upward by the California drought and some dairy prices by increased international demand for dairy, according to analysts.To be sure, some staples are decreasing in cost. The price of a chicken breast has declined 17% over the past decade (though recently has up-ticked slightly) and cheese has declined 11% over that period, according to Rabo AgriFinance.Still, prices overall are higher, which means that hosting a barbecue can be costly. Here are some ways to save.Make strategic substitutionsRay Venezia, the master butcher at Master Purveyors , says that those looking to save money may want to switch to another cut of meat. “Beef brisket is a popular winter holiday cut that becomes very affordable during the summer months — it is well suited for barbecues and can feed a crowd,” he says. He adds that if you want to make traditional burgers, you should purchase regular ground meat because it is cheaper than pre-made beef burgers and adds that handmade burgers can have more flavor anyway. Furthermore, boneless sirloin steak is the only true steak cut that you will generally find for under $10 a pound, he adds; and “if you are having four or more people at the gathering, sirloin steaks are great because one steak will feed four to six people,” he says.If you’re going the chicken route, he suggests boneless chicken thighs because they are more affordable than boneless breast and have more flavor. “Chicken thighs cut up and placed on skewers are easy to cook, shrink less and come out more flavorful than chicken breasts on the grill,” he says. And Lynette Rice, founder of CleverlySimple.com , says that you should look to buy bigger cuts of meat (the whole pork loin, rather than a bunch of pork chops) as this too will save you money. And, she adds, the butcher might even cut the pork loin up for you at no additional cost.Fruits, vegetables and other items should also be substituted to save money. Some of Stephanie Nelson’s, founder of CouponMom.com , suggestions include: Using lemons instead of limes and brown rice instead of potatoes and baking chicken breasts and slicing the meat for sandwiches rather than buying deli lunchmeat. Food blogger Jay Ducote says that consumers should forgo the pricey cooking sprays when greasing the grill and instead put canola oil in a spray bottle and grease the grill that way.Opt for fresh, not frozenAndrea Woroch, a consumer savings expert at Kinoli , says that sometimes you can save by opting for fresh ground beef rather than frozen burger patties. “Frozen patties may seem more economical, but many grocers will put ground beef on special just before the holiday to push sale,” she says. What’s more, “many times they will actually sell these items at near cost to get you in their store for all your holiday food purchases,” says barbecue hobbyist Daniel Vaczi. And grocers often want to get rid of meat that’s close to expiration, so for consumers planning to cook it ASAP this can be a great deal. Nelson notes that warehouse clubs are often also a good bet for lower priced meats, and you can freeze any leftovers to have for dinner at a later date.Skip the grocery storeWoroch says it’s worth taking a second trip to the dollar store for items like paper plates, napkins and plasticware, as well as things like serving platters, trays and ice buckets — as the savings can be significant. Rice says that if you need extra glassware, hit up Goodwill in your area, where these items are often $1 or less.Conserve fuelEstimate how much fuel you’ll need ahead of a cookout and you can avoid some unnecessary spending, says Jon Lal, CEO and founder of BeFrugal.com . “For a charcoal grill, you only need approximately three pounds of charcoal for four to six people,” he explains. “Most charcoal is ready after heating for about 15 minutes.” If you have a gas grill, he notes that, once started, it will be ready to cook in about 10 minutes.Go high techJessica Fisher, the author of “Good Cheap Eats, Everyday Dinners and Fantastic Feasts for $10 or Less,” says that consumers can find fantastic deals on condiments, charcoal and other seasonal items right now. That’s especially easy to do — and to compare prices — if you use your smartphone to search for grocery coupons. Woroch recommends looking for grocery coupons on CouponSherpa.com. Other good options include: Favado.com and Coupons.com.Also see:July 4th for snobs	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=AC7C41BE-022B-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02
Regulators release U.S. financial firms’ ‘living wills’	By Ryan TracyThe so-called “living wills,” a requirement of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, are intended as a blueprint to help regulators understand what to do in the event a financial firm faces collapse.For the first time this year, three nonbank firms, American International Group, Inc. /quotes/zigman/557836/delayed/quotes/nls/aig AIG +0.71%  , Prudential Financial Inc. /quotes/zigman/294774/delayed/quotes/nls/pru PRU +1.58%  , and General Electric’s Co’s /quotes/zigman/227468/delayed/quotes/nls/ge GE +0.94%   financing arm, GE Capital, submitted their plans to regulators. Those companies were brought under Federal Reserve oversight last year after being designated as “systemically important”.Eleven large banks filed the third drafts of their plans. However, the banks have yet to receive a formal, individual critique on last year’s round of living wills.

Euro closes slightly down ahead of ECB meeting	By Joseph Adinolfi, MarketWatchThis ECB meeting “could be rather subdued” as economic data hasnt changed significantly during the past month, said Mads Koefoed, head of macro strategy at Saxo Bank, in a note.The last two ECB policy meetings were eventful, with ECB President Mario Draghi promising action in May and then delivering with announcements of rate cuts in June.

The results are based on responses from 32,405 subscribers to Consumer Reports, and more than 96,200 dining experiences at 65 fast-food and fast-casual chains.So it’s no surprise that McDonald’s U.S. same-store sales fell 1% in May from a year ago, were flat in April and declined 1.7% in the first quarter.“More and more, food quality -- not just low price -- is emerging as a deciding factor for many Americans when choosing where to spend their dining dollars,” said Tod Marks, senior projects editor at Consumer Reports.More must reads from MarketWatch :How the jobs report could disrupt the market’s snoozeThe only World Cup team left to root for10 things rich people know that you don’t	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8CE9A5A4-0220-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

Stock market live blog recap: Dow at record closing high but still shy of 17,000	This is a recap of market action on Wednesday. For a concise rundown of the day’s trading activity, read Market Snapshot.After a flurry of excitement on that stronger-than-expected ADP private payroll number, stock-index futures are looking pretty flat.S&P 500 futures are up a half point, while Dow futures are holding a 12-point gain and the Nasdaq 100 contract is up 1.5 points.So how excited should everybody be over the stronger-than-expected ADP estimate of private-sector payrolls?MarketWatch’s Steve Goldstein stacks up the caveats, noting that the ADP report isn’t a terribly reliable guide to the Labor Department’s nonfarm payrolls report. That report, the main event of the week, is due Thursday morning (a day earlier than usual thanks to the July 4th holiday). It was a wobbly start for stocks, with major indexes flitting between small gains and losses.Right now, the S&P 500 is up less than a half point at 1,973.60, while the Dow industrials are up less than 4 points at 16,959.80. The Nasdaq Composite is up 2.63 points at 4,461.28.Constellation Brands is the S&P 500′s upside leader in the early going, gaining 5% after first-quarter earnings surged, boosted as the company’s beer segment benefited from the $5.3 billion acquisition of U.S. distribution rights for Corona and other Mexican beers and a Mexican brewery from Anheuser-Busch InBev.We now know the identity of the successful bidder who bought all 30,000 bitcoins seized by the U.S. government when it seized Silk Road. Reuters reports that it was venture capitalist Tim Draper, who sponsors bitcoin trading platform Vaurum. The auction netted $18 million.The number of earnings warning issued by companies in the S&P 500 have dropped for a second consecutive quarter ahead of Q2 earnings season and the number of companies issuing positive guidance is on the rise, according to FactSet.That sounds positive, but it’s also worth noting that companies that offer negative warnings are getting punished more severely than in the past, while those offering positive vibrations aren’t getting as much reward.We’re almost a half hour into the trading session and stocks are still struggling to find a direction.S&P 500 — up 0.51 point at 1,973.83DJIA — up 7.05 points at 16,963.12Nasdaq Composite — up 6.05 points at 4,464.80Somebody attach a camera to GoPro’s stock price. The video-equipment maker, which debuted in a high-profile IPO just last week, is plummeting this morning, falling 11.2% to $43.30 a share at last check.A negative finish would mark the first daily loss for the stock after a four-day win streak that resulted in a 103% gain.U.S. factory orders fell 0.5% in May, a smidge bigger loss than the 0.4% penciled in by economists surveyed by MarketWatch.Stocks are still looking for direction.S&P 500 up 0.34 point at 1,973.66DJIA — up 8.8 points at 16,964.87Nasdaq Composite — up 2.21 points at 4,460.86 It was another month of outflows for Bill Gross’s Pimco Total Return Fund i June, according to Morningstar data released Wednesday. Net redemptions reduced total assets by 2% to $229 billion. The fund returned 0.37% in June, outperforming the benchmark Barclays Aggregate Bond Index return of 0.05%.More than an hour into the session, the main indexes still aren’t making any big moves after yesterday’s record-setting advance.But at least it’s the case that they’ve been mostly trading higher so far today.So the S&P 500 and Dow are both on track to score record closes again, even though the S&P has briefly dipped into the red at times, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is currently negative.S&P +0.1%Dow +0.1%Nasdaq +0.2%Russell -0.01%The Fed’s Janet Yellen and the IMF’s Christine Lagarde are talking today.And we’ve got a live blog on this here.For starters, the text of Yellen’s has just come out, and that could be helping the S&P 500 score another session high.Photo credit: AFP/Getty ImagesMarketWatch’s Greg Robb, writing over at our Yellen-Lagarde live blog, says this is the main point from Yellen’s speech:“Taking all of these factors into consideration, I do not presently see a need for monetary policy to deviate from a primary focus on attaining price stability and maximum employment, in order to address financial stability concerns. That said, I do see pockets of increased risk-taking across the financial system, and an acceleration or broadening of these concerns could necessitate a more robust macroprudential approach.”So perhaps that initial small pop for stocks came from the stay-the-course tone, but it’s now faded — and the Dow is almost dipping into negative territory.The main indexes have pulled back from their session highs.After flattish action earlier today, they had been showing some modest gains, but now they’re back to flattish again.S&P 500 +0.04%Dow +0.01%Nasdaq -0.03%Russell 2000 -0.27%Stocks “might not do much today” after Tuesday’s record-setting advance, says Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at R.W. Baird.“The market kind of broke out in a sense yesterday,” he said in a phone interview this morning.He noted the all-important jobs report is expected tomorrow, and its wage-growth numbers could be key, given their link to inflation expectations.“I kind of doubt we’re going to get a big wage number, but you never know,” he said.Credit for photo of calm ocean: Shutterstock.comDoug Coté continues to sound upbeat in a phone interview this morning. He is chief investment strategist at Voya Investment Management, previously ING Investment Management.He noted this week has provided good numbers on manufacturing and private-sector jobs.“It bodes well for tomorrow’s non-farm payrolls,” he told MarketWatch, referring to the closely watched monthly jobs report.He said the U.S. economy is recovering, and he’s also upbeat on the U.K., Germany and Japan.“Investors are too defensive, and they need to get into this market,” Coté told MarketWatch.Credit for photo of guy diving in: Getty ImagesGetting back to that Yellen speech, this seems like a reasonable reaction from the Twitterverse:(Hat tip to our ongoing Yellen-Lagarde live blog — check it out here — for highlighting this tweet.)#Yellen speech is on balance mildly dovish in that she does not see the need to raise rates to address financial stability concerns.— Joseph A.

U.S. stocks edge up to records again, but no Dow 17,000	By Victor Reklaitis and Carla Mozee, MarketWatchThe Dow industrials /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.54%  rose 20.17 points, or 0.1%, to end at 16,976.24, putting it once again within striking distance of 17,000, while the S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.55%  nudged up 1.30 points, or 0.1%, to finish at 1,974.62. Each index scored a record close for the second straight day.The Nasdaq /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP +0.63%  bucked Wednesday’s positive trend, falling 0.92 point, or less than 0.1%, to close at 4,457.73. The tech-heavy index snapped a three-session winning streak.Investors are awaiting Thursday’s monthly jobs report, and even a surprisingly strong private-sector jobs report couldn’t jolt the market to life. Thursday’s report is expected to show a net gain of 215,000 non-farm jobs and a steady 6.3% unemployment rate.The ADP report, which showed 281,000 new private-sector jobs, has “not been a good indicator” for the jobs report, but still “the growth bulls will be pleased, and the “whisper numbers” for the jobs report will probably rise, said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities, in emailed comments.

TSA to tighten security for flights coming to U.S.	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The federal government is tightening security measures at certain overseas airports with direct flights to the United States. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement he has directed the Transportation Security Administration to put in place enhanced security measures at the airports, which he did not name. Johnson said the U.S. is sharing recent and relevant information with its overseas allies and is consulting the aviation industry.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=696F2745-0A0B-4569-99EB-09497E2EE8AD&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02
Google hides a Wall Street pariah	By David Weidner, MarketWatchThat’s because when BBC Economics Editor Robert Peston did a Google search of his blog recently, there was a post missing. Instead of a 2007 post about O’Neal, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch & Co., he got this message:“We regret to inform you that we are no longer able to show the following pages from your website in response to certain searches on European versions of Google.”It seems the O’Neal post was scrubbed as part of a European Court of Justice ruling in May that ordered Google Inc. /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%  to delete “inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant” data from its results when a member of the public requests it.So far, it’s not clear who requested that the post be removed. But, as Peston notes, O’Neal’s legacy at one of the financial firms (Merrill was ultimately acquired by Bank of America Corp. /quotes/zigman/190927/delayed/quotes/nls/bac BAC +1.14% ) at the center of the financial crisis is certainly relevant — still. And let’s be realistic, who in the world is looking out for Stan O’Neal at this point other than Stan O’Neal?Already it appears a law meant to give regular citizens the right to a new start is being abused by public figures who don’t like negative coverage, otherwise known as fair analysis. Back in 2007 I wrote that O’Neal “ruled with a cool determination and, by some accounts, explosive temper. He diversified. He preserved and grew the brokerage. Merrill’s stock doubled. But his insistence to drive profit by taking on risk proved to be his undoing.”Sorry if you can’t read that in Luxembourg.Ultimately, it’s clear that this law is going to backfire on the courts and the public figures who think they can scrub the record and rewrite their on personal histories as told by the Internet.

Delta, United drag down airline sector	By Tomi KilgoreThe NYSE Arca Airline index /quotes/zigman/6015477/realtime XX:XAL +0.56%   slumped 2.1% in afternoon trading, as 11 of the 13 actively traded components lost ground. The sector, which was the strongest of the S&P 500 subsectors during the first half of 2014, has stalled of late. The index was still up 22% this year, but was down 0.3% over the last month.The sector’s weakness is also weighing heavily on the Dow Jones Transportation Average /quotes/zigman/627450/realtime DJT +0.75%  , which is shedding 0.3% in the face of the 0.1% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.54%  Among the airline sector’s biggest losers, Delta /quotes/zigman/463579/delayed/quotes/nls/dal DAL +0.94%   dropped 5.1% in recent trading to $38.24, and was on course for the lowest close in six weeks. Earlier, the air carrier reported consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile for June rose 4.5% from the year-ago period. Cowen analyst Helane Becker had pegged June PRASM growth at 6%.Delta also said yields on international flights were disappointing because of capacity increases across the industry and lower business travel to Latin America because of the World Cup.United Continental Holdings /quotes/zigman/617037/delayed/quotes/nls/ual UAL +1.55%   slid 5.8% to $39.82, and was on track to close at a near two-month low. Technically speaking, the stock was headed for the first close below its 200-day moving average -- what many chart watchers use to gauge a stocks’ long-term trend -- since October 2013.Elsewhere, JetBlue Airways /quotes/zigman/87304/delayed/quotes/nls/jblu JBLU +1.30%   fell 2% to $10.76, a day after closing at a seven-year high. Southwest Airlines /quotes/zigman/241463/delayed/quotes/nls/luv LUV +0.87%   pulled back 0.4% from Tuesday’s all-time closing high of $27.73. Alaska Holdings /quotes/zigman/216861/delayed/quotes/nls/alk ALK +1.03%   declined 1.4% to $96.24 and Republic Airways /quotes/zigman/87880/delayed/quotes/nls/rjet RJET -0.64%   lost 0.7% to $11.01.The Arca Airline index’s gainers SkyWest /quotes/zigman/77976/delayed/quotes/nls/skyw SKYW -0.32%  , which added 0.7% to $12.63, and Copa Holdings, /quotes/zigman/400162/delayed/quotes/nls/cpa CPA +0.40%   which advanced 0.3% to $144.50.On a bright note, Cowen’s Becker said she believes the selloff in Delta’s stock provided “an opportunity for investors to buy,” as the World Cup is ending later in the month and because forward bookings and pricing remain strong. And Moody’s Investors Service upgraded Delta’s credit rating Wednesday to Ba3, or still three notches below investment grade, from B1.More must reads from MarketWatch :10 thing rich people know that you don’tGoldman labeled a ‘boys club’ in discrimination suitGoPro shares fall after four-session run-up	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=171C8CDE-0206-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02
Gold futures stretch advance to fourth session	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchGold scored gains even after a stronger-than-expected estimate of U.S. private-sector payrolls fed expectations for a strong employment report.August gold futures /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.05%  tacked on $4.30, or 0.3%, to settle at $1,330.90 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices, which tallied a gain of nearly $10 an ounce over the past three trading sessions, settled at their highest since March 21, based on the most-active contracts.September silver /quotes/zigman/12294966/delayed SIU4 +0.30%  also rose 18.5 cents, or 0.9%, to end at $21.30 an ounce.Gold prices had traded a bit lower immediately after the data on private-sector jobs were released Wednesday, but then turned positive again. They found support “mainly on the back of the optimism that Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen is “going to stay consistent in her message and will maintain the dovish tone, which is eroding demand for the dollar,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade.Private-sector employers added 281,000 jobs in June, according to an estimate Wednesday from Automatic Data Processing. Economists use ADP data to get a feel for the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report, which is forecast to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 215,000 jobs in June versus a May gain of 217,000.The dollar traded higher after the report, gaining ground on the euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/realtime/sampled EURUSD -0.1088%  and the Japanese yen /quotes/zigman/4868099/realtime/sampled USDJPY -0.1202% . A stronger dollar can be negative for commodities priced in the currency by making it more expensive to those using other currencies.“Mid-June’s big jump aside, gold has become so boring not even U.S. payrolls are giving traders much fun right now,” said Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault.Ahead of Wednesday’s ADP release, prices “tried a little of the usual runaround, but the bid stayed firm,” he said. Unless Thursday’s official nonfarm payrolls data blows past 300,000, “it’s hard to see U.S. futures getting sold before the long weekend.” Comex floor trading will be closed Friday for the Independence Day holiday.Other metals on Comex ended broadly higher.High-grade copper for September delivery /quotes/zigman/678463/delayed HGU4 -0.27% closed up 6 cents, or 1.9%, at $3.265 per pound. October platinum /quotes/zigman/19534176/delayed PLV4 -0.34% shed $3.50, or 0.2%, to $1,511.50 an ounce after Tuesday’s 2.2% advance. Palladium for September delivery /quotes/zigman/18010104/delayed PAU4 +0.37%  climbed $2.80, or 0.3%, to $857.40 an ounce.Shares of gold and silver miners rose in afternoon dealings, with the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index /quotes/zigman/1475600/delayed XAU +0.14%  up 1.9%.

Buyout firms’ fees come under review	By Mark Maremont and Mike SpectorAt issue are millions of dollars received by private-equity firms in exchange for cut-rate prices on items as varied as coffee and personal computers.The Securities and Exchange Commission is concerned that fund investors, which give private-equity firms cash for corporate takeovers and other investments, aren’t getting enough information about fees earned by buyout firms for these group-purchasing programs, SEC officials said.Unlike most fees charged by private-equity groups, commissions from group-purchasing programs usually aren’t shared with the pension funds, university endowments and wealthy individuals that invest in buyout funds.“Group-purchasing programs may present a conflict of interest” for buyout firms, said Igor Rozenblit, co-head of the private fund unit at the SEC’s compliance inspections division. He said firms need to disclose “all relevant facts, including whether or not the group-purchasing program is a source of revenue for the PE manager.”An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.Dimon cancer disclosure is the right approachSneaky malware lurks until you log into your bankWhat to look for in June jobs report	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=EB62E040-0221-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

Treasurys sink as ADP stokes jobs day jitters	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR 0.00%  yield, which rises as prices fall, was up 6 basis points on the day at 2.625%. The benchmark yield hit its highest level in over a week.Automatic Data Processing Inc. said Wednesday that the U.S. added 281,000 private-sector jobs in June, substantially higher than the 179,000 added in May. The reading, which was the highest since the end of 2012, beat expectations of 210,000.The report is often used as an early reading on the more heavily-watched nonfarm payrolls report, which is due out on Thursday. Economists expect the report to show 215,000 new jobs in June.Treasury prices slipped throughout the day, largely due to, “the ADP, which was much higher than expected, and what it may foretell for the nonfarm payrolls report,” said Larry Milstein, managing director of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR 0.00%  yield rose 6.5 basis points on the day to 3.459% and the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR 0.00%  yield rose 5.5 basis points to 1.709%.Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen reiterated on Wednesday that monetary policy should focus on improving labor market conditions , which means staying the course with the current low-rate policy. She disagreed with the view that monetary policy should be tightened simply to limit market excesses, saying that it was a blunt tool for maintaining financial stability. Instead, worrisome signs of financial excess may be better served with macroprudential tools, she said.Data also showed factory orders dropped 0.5% in May.As Dow flirts with 17,000, investors are harder to impressGeorge Soros’ top dividend picksIt’s a mystery: Where has 99% of the ocean’s trash gone?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=DAC20776-01E4-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

At Wimbledon, will a man outside the ‘Big Four’ finally win?	By Steven KutzThe Big Four — Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray — are so named because of their dominance. Since the French Open in 2005, one of them has won every Grand Slam title except for the 2009 U.S. Open and the 2014 Australian Open. And at Wimbledon they have been the most dominant; no one but them has won the title since 2003.That may change in 2014, as two of the Big Four have already been knocked out of the tournament.Defending champion Andy Murray lost in the quarterfinals on Wednesday to Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria 6-1, 7-6, 6-2. The 23-year-old Dimitrov has been regarded as a future top player for years. And though he says he doesn’t like it, he has been given the nickname “Baby Federer” because his strokes resemble Roger Federer’s. That’s high praise, as Federer has more Grand Slam singles titles — 17 — than anyone else in the Open era.The day before, Rafael Nadal of Spain , the No. 1 player in the world, lost 7-6, 5-7, 7-6, 6-3 to 19-year-old Australian player Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round.The other two of the Big Four are still alive in the tournament, but they’ve been pushed hard. Roger Federer, the No. 4 player in the world, beat his friend and countryman Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals 3-6, 7-6, 6-4, 6-4.And Novak Djokovic of Serbia, the No. 2 player in the world, needed to go five sets to win his quarterfinal match against Marin Cilic of Croatia 6-1, 3-6, 6-7, 6-2, 6-2.John McEnroe has called this “the golden age of men’s tennis” because of all the high quality and thrilling matches played by the Big Four.In the semifinals on Friday, Djokovic will play 23-year-old Milos Raonic of Canada, and Federer will play Dimitrov. It certainly won’t be easy for the 23-year-olds to win. And if Federer, already considered by many to be the greatest player of the Open era, wins the tournament, it would be his 18th Grand Slam title, which would extend his own record. At 32-years-old, and with Murray and Nadal out, this could be his best chance to get one more.But as Dimitrov showed against Murray, he is not intimidated by playing one of the Big Four. Perhaps a fifth player will hoist the Wimbledon trophy for the first time since 2002.The men’s final will be on Sunday, July 6.Also see:Rafael Nadal loses to 19-year-old who hit this amazing shotAt Wimbledon, John McEnroe explains how he would make tennis more popular	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B9F0C9F0-021C-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

ADP jobs numbers a good sign despite caveats	By Steve Goldstein, MarketWatchADP, on a month-to-month basis, is not terribly reliably in predicting the nonfarm payrolls that the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.The last time a private-sector payrolls number was higher than the 281,000 reported in June, was in November 2012 — when job gains didn’t really start accelerating from there.Even if job gains start chugging along in the high 200/low 300 level per month, it doesn’t mean wage growth will.OK, so, yes, yes and yes.But still.It’s not like ADP is an outlier, not when the payroll series has been trending higher, jobless claims have been low, and job openings have been on the rise.There’s a reason the unemployment rate has dropped to 6.3% from a peak of 10%.And as the jobless rate hits “full employment” level somewhere in the 5% to 6% range — Janet Yellen says it’s 5.4%, others at the Fed put it higher — then wage growth should start to move meaningfully higher next year.A jobs market finally getting to normal may not mean much for the stock market that’s already at record highs. But the real risk is that the Bill Grosses of the world have priced in far-too-bearish an economic scenario into the bond market, where yields on government bonds look way too low.So, go pour cold water on the ADP report if you will. The bond market certainly will. Whether they will regret that in a year from now remains to be seen.Also read: 281,000 private-sector jobs added in June, ADP saysJamie Dimon diagnosed with cancer	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0E053948-01E8-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02
Oil falls below $105, logs fifth straight decline	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchPrices had pared losses earlier Wednesday immediately after a weekly U.S. government report showed a steeper-than-expected drop in crude supplies.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.28%  fell 86 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $104.48 a barrel, the lowest close since June 11. They were trading at around $104.65 before the supply data were released then rebounded to trade above $105.40 after them.On the ICE Futures exchange, August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -0.38%  fell $1.05, or 0.9%, to end at $111.24 a barrel.“Oil markets are a bit tired of the Iraq risk premium, and it has dissipated,” said Richard Hastings, macro strategist at Global Hunter Securities. “Then we get the inevitable hunger for oil revenues in Libya, so the possibilities of some big tankers getting to Libya’s ports could bring huge cargoes into the oil movement news, all of which is taking U.S. crude back into the $104 handle with $102 possibly getting some thoughts, too.”Libyan rebels reached a deal to reopen two terminals which handle almost half of the country’s normal oil exports, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY +0.07%  got a boost following comments from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen. A stronger dollar tends to pressure prices for dollar-denominated commodities.Reports on oil stockpiles and private-sector payrolls put a floor on the market’s losses Wednesday.The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles fell 3.2 million barrels for the week ended June 27. Analysts polled by Platts forecast a decline of 2 million barrels.“Looking at the crude-oil sector, with most geopolitical fear premium coming out of the market from recent overseas troubles, traders’ focus [has shifted toward] fundamental supply numbers,” as well as Thursday’s much-anticipated monthly U.S. jobs report, said John Macaluso, research analyst at Tyche Capital Advisors.Meanwhile, a report on private-sector payrolls showed employers added the most jobs since November 2012. Upbeat economic data tend to buoy the outlook for energy demand.The EIA also reported that weekly gasoline supplies declined by 1.2 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles rose by 1 million barrels.August gasoline /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 -0.23%  fell more than a penny to $3.02 a gallon, while August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821453/delayed HOQ4 -0.35% closed at $2.95 a gallon, down 3 cents.Though violence in Iraq has faded a bit from the headlines, drivers heading out for the July 4 holiday will face the highest gasoline prices since 2008, due in part to the renewed violence in the nation.Gasoline futures, however, were under pressure Wednesday on concerns that tropical storm Arthur, which is heading up the eastern U.S. seaboard, could cut into holiday festivities and reduce demand for the fuel, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group.Also on Nymex, August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 -0.86%  fell 10 cents, or 2.2%, to settle at $4.36 per million British thermal units.

Sneaky malware lurks on your computer until you log into your bank	By Priya Anand, MarketWatchThe new strain starts with an old tactic: Spam. Messages detail financial transactions and include a link, but instead of luring users to phony websites to trick them into typing their banking credentials, the malware stealthily injects malicious code into the browser so it can later detect when the customer is banking online, according to Trend Micro.“It’s going to have graphics and terminology that would make you believe, hey, that sounds pretty legitimate,” says JD Sherry, vice president of technology and solutions at Trend Micro. “Once you click on that, you don’t have intelligence to basically say that’s a bad link. The device is going to download that particular malware.”Last year saw a million new strains of banking malware, double the prior year’s volume, according to Trend Micro. The new variant, called Emotet, first cropped up largely in Germany, with 75% of cases across the Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The remaining 25% of complaints came from across the Asia-Pacific, the U.S. and Japan.Most banking malware follows the model of Gameover Zeus, a network that international law enforcement authorities seized control of in June. Gameover Zeus lifted banking credentials from as many as 1 million infected Microsoft Windows computers by intercepting online transactions to bypass two-factor authentication and displaying fake security messages to gain credentials, nabbing more than $100 million.One of the classic giveaways of spam is that the messages are usually filled with poor grammar and spelling. With Emotet, though, the nasty messages are less conspicuous. And the new malware mitigates one of the telltale signs that a computer is part of a botnet (a network of infected machines, or robots) by hiding until people enter banking websites, rather than slowing applications down by continually running.The new malware makes two computer rules more critical, Sherry says. Download an antivirus program from a reputable security company, and don’t click on anything you didn’t actively search for or land on through your own browsing.Also see:Is your computer secretly a bot?5 ways to protect yourself from credit card fraudIs identity theft insurance a waste of money?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=96F48ABE-021B-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

GM CEO Mary Barra to testify to Senate on July 17	By Jeff Bennett and Siobhan HughesThe Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Insurance is expected to release a more detailed list of any additional witnesses who might be called to testify next week. It is highly likely Chicago attorney Anton Valukas, who handled the internal probe of the auto maker’s recall delay, will also be asked to join Barra.This will be Barra’s second appearance before the committee since her visit in April. Last month, she testified before a House committee for a second time as law makers pushed for an update on the steps she has take within the company.It is still unknown at this time if former GM /quotes/zigman/1466682/delayed/quotes/nls/gm GM 0.00%   engineer Ray DeGiorgio will be called before the committee. DeGiorgio is at the heart of the delayed recall as he was the one who designed the switch and then deflected questions when other engineers began noticing flaws.Too much weight on or a sudden jarring to the ignition key can cause the ignition switch to move from a “run” setting to “accessory,” thereby cutting power to the car and air bags. GM says 13 people have been killed in accidents related to the ignition switch recall.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.How the jobs report could disrupt the market’s snoozeWhat online retirement calculators don’t calculateDimon cancer disclosure is the right approach to serious illness	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B4126700-0217-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

Seven economists attended the lunch from across the political spectrum including former Reagan economic adviser Martin Feldstein and Melissa Kearney, director of the Hamilton Project at the liberal Brookings Institution. The president is having these kind of discussions on a regular basis, Earnest said.

Why your rent is so damn high	By Quentin FottrellRents advertised by landlords rose by 0.8% during the second quarter to $1,099, according to data released Wednesday by real estate research firm Reis Inc., while the national vacancy rate was 4.1%, in line with the first quarter and down slightly from 4.3% for the same period a year ago. Rents also rose by over 6% on the year in San Francisco and San Jose, Calif. and Seattle, Wash., cities where rents are typically expected to rise, but also rose by 5% in Nashville, Tenn. and Charleston, S.C.Renting has become significantly less affordable in recent years, according to a 2013 report by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. In fact, 50% of U.S. renters spent more than 30% of their gross income on rent (the traditional measure of affordability) in 2010, up a record 12 percentage points from the 38% of households facing such a burden a decade prior. And many of those households, about 27% of renters, spent more than half of their salary on rent, up from just 19% of renters who did so a decade ago.This comes at a time when more Americans are renting: 35% in 2012 versus 31% in 2004. The consequences for those who can’t find affordable housing can be dire, the Harvard report noted, leading families on already tight budgets to spend significantly less on health care and retirement savings.One contributor to deteriorating affordability was rising unemployment, the report noted. But there are other factors at work as well. “Slow housing starts and stagnant wages have been a bad combination for renters,” says Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors. Construction of housing units has averaged around 1.5 million a year for the past five decades, he says, but is likely to be less than 1 million this year. Taking into account the collapse in the housing market after 2008, he says, the inventory of newly constructed homes is at a 50-year low and housing construction needs to increase 50% to reach normal levels. Meanwhile, the average seasonally adjusted hourly earnings of all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was $24.38 in May 2014, largely unchanged from $23.67 a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Young people are particularly at the mercy of landlords, studies show, and are still struggling to get jobs. Although employment among 25- to 34-year-olds rose to 75.3% in May 2014, mostly unchanged from 75.4% a year earlier, according to the Labor Department, that’s still far below the 78% to 80% employment level for that age group before the 2008 recession. And the unemployment rate for that age group rose to 6.9% in May, up from 6.6% the month before, despite overall unemployment remaining at 6.3% in May, the lowest level since September 2008. “Many renters have been forced to find an additional roommate and live in more crowded spaces just to share the rent,” Yun says.Landlords are also hiking rents, making it harder for renters to save enough money to consider buying a home. Real median rents adjusted for inflation increased by 6% nationally between 2000 and 2012, while the real median income of renters actually fell by 13% over the same period, the Harvard study found. “We are losing ground rapidly against a chronic problem that forces households to cut essential spending,” Eric Belsky, managing director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, said in a statement. That trend continues: Nationwide, rents rose 2.7% in the 12 months leading up to October 2013, according to recent data from real-estate marketplace Trulia.That trend continues: Nationwide, rents rose 4.5% in the 12 months leading up to April 2014, according to recent data from real-estate marketplace Trulia: Rent increases in San Francisco, Oakland and Denver were up 10%. Among the 25 largest rental markets, landlords hiked rents the most in San Francisco, Portland and Seattle, while reducing them the most in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. San Francisco had one of the steepest annual increases, reaching $3,450 in April for a two-bedroom unit (51% of the average local wage); the New York/New Jersey area also had a monthly rent of $3,450 in April for a two-bedroom unit (62% share of the average local wage); Miami had an average monthly rent of $2,350 for a two-bedroom unit (62% share of the average local wage).(This story has been updated.)Also read:Half of Americans can’t afford their houseThe kids aren’t buying homesAmerica’s least favorite neighbors: renters	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=32E932B0-6101-11E3-B953-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

Morgan Cazenove. “With the restructuring proceeding at a faster pace than guided originally and the stock having pulled back because some investors have taken profits, not because progress has stalled, we upgrade the stock to overweight,” wrote analyst Sandeep Deshpande.AstraZeneca PLC /quotes/zigman/244926/delayed UK:AZN -0.12%  notched a 1.1% rise, extending Tuesday’s gains after Chief Executive Pascal Soriot spent £2 million ($3.4 million) to raise his stake in the British drug maker.AstraZeneca aided in pushing the U.K.’s FTSE 100 /quotes/zigman/3173262/delayed UK:UKX +0.01% up 0.2% at 6,816.37.

After examining possibilities that would lead to consolidation in the French telecoms market, Orange said it “believes that it cannot pursue this avenue at the present time as the conditions that the group has set have not been met.”In recent weeks, Orange was reported to be in talks to acquire a stake in mobile operator Bouygues Telecom amid a push by the French government for telecom-sector consolidation. Bouygues SA /quotes/zigman/163448/delayed FR:EN -0.71% shares fell 2%. Shares of Iliad SA /quotes/zigman/259579/delayed FR:ILD -1.00% , which had previously put up a bid for the Bouygues unit, finished down 3.5%.A combination between Iliad and Bouygues “may happen and that it could still be positive for the French mobile market,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Olivia Peters in a note. “However, it seems that the parties concerned are unable to agree on a price which spans from €5-€8 billion.”The pullback in Orange and Bouygues shares put pressure on France’s CAC 40 equity index /quotes/zigman/3173214/delayed FR:PX1 -0.47% , which fell 0.4% at 4,444.72.Stock in Roche /quotes/zigman/278482/delayed CH:ROG -0.15%  lost grip of gains and closed lower by 0.3%.

SolarCity, SunRun sue Arizona over solar tax	By Claudia Assis, MarketWatchSolarCity /quotes/zigman/13139813/delayed/quotes/nls/scty SCTY -1.07%  and privately held SunRun have popularized leasing, rather than owning, residential rooftop systems. The companies install and maintain the systems in return for monthly payments that are generally less than a homeowner’s monthly power bill.Arizona’s revenue department last year interpreted that solar panels are not exempt from taxes, and the companies filed their complaint on Monday.There are concerns that applying taxes on systems would wipe out the savings from solar leasing and stunt solar-power growth in Arizona.SolarCity and SunRun representatives have not yet returned requests for comment about the lawsuit.GTM Research earlier this week said the ruling would have a “material impact” on Arizona’s rooftop solar market. The state was No. 2 after California in new installations last year.Canaccord Genuity has initiated coverage of SolarCity stock with a “buy” rating and a $94 price target, saying the company, the largest U.S. solar installer, “will continue to lever its scale, leading brand, project finance capabilities and channel partners to reduce component costs, costs of capital, expand geographically and continue growing volumes.”SolarCity “has changed the landscape of the residential solar market, taking advantage of investor’s tax appetite and a desire for yield to install more solar systems than many of its largest competitors combined,” analyst Josh Baribeau wrote.Canaccord also started covering SunPower Corp. /quotes/zigman/7312465/delayed/quotes/nls/spwr SPWR -1.46%  with a hold rating and a $41 price target.Among other solar stocks, Chinese solar-panel makers were mostly in the red.

Murray knocked out of Wimbledon in loss to Dimitrov	LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Title holder Andy Murray is out of Wimbledon after losing to Grigor Dimitrov in the mens tennis quarterfinals on Wednesday. Dimitrov, a 23-year-old Bulgarian seeded 11th, beat Murray in three straight sets to advance to the semifinals of the Grand Slam tournament in London. Murray joins second seed Rafael Nadal in making a surprise exit from Wimbledon, while first seed Novak Djokovic was one set down in his own quarter-final game on Wednesday afternoon. British hopes were focused on 27-year-old Murray defending his title after he became the first British man to win at Wimbledon in more than 70 years in 2013. Dimitrov, nicknamed Baby Federer, will meet Djokovic or Marin Cilic in the next round, depending on the outcome of that quarterfinal.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C33511CD-0149-4D7A-B43C-003ED94ECA79&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

Target asks customers to keep guns out of stores	By Reid J.

Yellen: Rate policy needs to focus on employment, not financial stability	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Financial stability concerns are not severe enough for monetary policy to deviate from its primary focus on low unemployment and price stability at the moment, but some pockets of risk taking bear watching, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Wednesday. In a speech at the International Monetary Fund, Yellen said that effective bank supervision must play the primary role in preventing future asset bubbles and crises. Monetary policy faces significant limitations as a tool to promote financial stability, Yellen said. But she said there may be times that interest rates should be raised to ameliorate emerging risks.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C7B0FE29-255F-49AE-85A3-0727D759A20A&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

Obama should stop golfing and be more like Pope Francis	By Darrell Delamaide, MarketWatchNot a real pope, of course, nor even a Jesuit archbishop willing to set aside the pomp of office for a simpler, humbler approach to public service. Someone, if you will, more along the lines of Cincinnatus, the farmer who stepped in twice to guide ancient Rome through a crisis and then returned to his farm — an example of civic virtue often cited in praise of George Washington.The president’s staff, entourage, travel and entertaining can cost American taxpayers in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion in a given year, according to various estimates.This compares with the roughly $60 million that British taxpayers contribute annually to support the royal family in the style to which it has become accustomed.Granted, President Barack Obama is not only a head of state but the head of a government with the largest budget in the world. And the security requirements for the leader of the free world are greater than for a quaint relic from the Middle Ages.Nor did Obama create the imperial bubble that he occupies. All recent presidents, Republican and Democrat, have operated with similar budgets and perks.But this creates the unseemly spectacle of a paid public servant jetting off any given weekend in a jumbo jet carrying dozens of bodyguards so that he can play golf with the celebrity of his choice.Avid golfer that he is, Obama can never hope to equal Dwight Eisenhower’s time on the links during his presidency.But even though he usually pairs the golf outing with a fundraiser or some official function, Obama has come under criticism for playing golf this year in California or Florida during acute phases of the crises in Ukraine and Iraq.The legalistic requirement that the president and his family pay equivalent commercial airfare for political or private trips does not significantly defray the cost of Air Force One to the public.This means that numerous vacations of the first family, from Marbella to Hawaii, entail unavoidable and stupefying costs for taxpayers.All presidents go on vacation, and there’s no point in quibbling whether the second George Bush’s frequent trips to his ranch in Texas cost more or less than the Obamas’ more exotic locales.Nor are the Obamas the first First Family to enjoy the social benefits of living in the White House. Ronald and Nancy Reagan happily dominated the Washington social scene during his presidency.Obama prefers to keep Washington pols at arm’s length and party with musicians, Hollywood stars and other glamorous people. But, hey, who wouldn’t?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C6D43942-01ED-11E4-8F8A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02
Venture capitalist Tim Draper wins bitcoin auction	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Venture capitalist Tim Draper bought all 30,000 bitcoins that were seized by the U.S. government when it busted Silk Road, an Internet-based drug ring that accepted bitcoins as payment, according to a report by Reuters Wednesday. Draper, who sponsors bitcoin trading platform Vaurum, acquired the bitcoin to help create a new service to provide liquidity in the currencies market, according to the report. The U.S. Marshals Service auctioned the seized bitcoins earlier this week, earning $18 million.

Gold futures score 5th straight session gain	By Myra P. Saefong and Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatchGold for August delivery /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.05%  edged up by $2.90, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,321.30 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It has now tallied a five-session gain of roughly $49 an ounce, or nearly 4%. On Monday, the shiny metal also inched higher, building slightly on last week’s advance of 3.3%.On Comex, gold prices have also now posted gains in 11 out of the previous 12 trading sessions.“It is Iraq and the Middle East which is the key reason for the rise in gold,” said Chintan Karnani, chief market analyst at New Delhi-based Insignia Consultants.But there are “still huge short positions in gold and silver,” he said. “Some of the investors have started exiting their short-term sell positions in gold and silver as there are no signs of a reversal at the moment .... Silver is also supported by global economic optimism for the rest of the year and next year.”But Karnani said he is “not very optimistic on global economic growth next quarter, due to higher energy prices.“Slow growth implies delay in interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and Bank of England, which should be bullish for gold and silver,” he said. “For now I keep my fingers crossed over the sustainability of the rise in gold and silver.”July silver /quotes/zigman/698627/delayed SIN4 +0.34%  gained 13 cents, or 0.6%, to end at $21.04 an ounce.In U.S. economic news on Tuesday, the S&P/Case-Shiller’s 20-city composite index indicated home prices rose 1.1% in April. A gauge of consumer confidence rose to 85.2 in June, the highest level since January 2008 and new homes sold at an annual rate of 504,000 in May to mark the fastest increase in six years.In a note Tuesday, Andrey Kryuchenkov of VTB Capital said that “from the longer-term investor perspective,” gold’s price rally is “only temporary.”He said the advance has been “pre-dominantly driven by uncertainty in Iraq where the government in Baghdad is struggling to halt the rapid advance of Sunni militants.”In Iraq on Tuesday, embattled Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and other top Iraqi politicians reportedly have pledged to start forming a new government by July 1, according to a Wall Street Journal article.But Ukraine-Russia tensions might be easing, as Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday asked parliament to rescind his authorization to use military forces in Ukraine . That marks a potentially major step toward de-escalating the crisis there, said a Wall Street Journal story.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=D7A45520-FB96-11E3-8AA5-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

U.S. factory orders drop 0.5% in May	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Orders for goods produced in U.S. factories fell 0.5% in May, largely because of fewer Pentagon bookings, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected orders to drop 0.4% owing to a decline in contracts for military goods. Orders climbed 0.2% excluding military-related items. In April, factory orders were revised up to show a 0.8% increase instead of 0.7%.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=19D9DE4F-8848-4834-9EDD-8406EEDF66E5&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

Can Constellation Brands’ buzz last?	By Tomi KilgoreShares of Constellation /quotes/zigman/267699/delayed/quotes/nls/stz STZ +0.77%  , which owns a host of brands including Robert Mondavi and Manischewitz wines, and Corona Light and Tsingtao beers, had already run up 26% this year through Tuesday, and have more than tripled over the last two years. The stock climbed as much as 7.2% to an all-time high of $94.77 before paring gains, following better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results and an upbeat full-year outlook. ( See earnings story )Constellation has outperformed its peers by a wide margin.

The S&P 500 has rallied 45% in two years, and closed at an all-time high on Tuesday.But now, some of Constellation’s shorter-term technical momentum indicators have reached overbought extremes seen just prior to previous pullbacks in April and January of this year. And on the longer-term charts, the same indicators have been trending lower this year while the stock has gained, suggesting momentum is fading.Keep in mind that last quarter, the stock rallied as much as 4.8% intraday after better-than-expected results, before closing down 1%.And while the company’s beer business is still very strong -- first-quarter sales were up 14% from last year -- wine and spirits sales, which represented nearly half of total sales last quarter, haven’t been as rosy. They were down 1% because of “lower shipment volume” resulting from distributor inventory destocking.In the previous two quarters, wines and spirits sales rose just 1% and 3% -- beer sales were up 13% and 21% -- as volume growth was offset by “higher promotional spend.” Looks like that higher spend hasn’t been working.This changes every...

281,000 private-sector jobs added in June, ADP says	By Ruth Mantell, MarketWatchJune’s gain of 281,000 private-sector jobs, as reported by Automatic Data Processing Inc., blew past forecasts from economists, who had expected an increase of 210,000. In May, private-sector employers added 179,000 jobs.“The job market is steadily improving,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, which prepares the report using ADP’s data. “Judging from the job market, the economic recovery remains fully intact and is gaining momentum.”The strong report that showed broad-based job gains comes one day ahead of the government’s key monthly snapshot of the U.S. labor market, and is likely to encourage economists. On Thursday, economists polled by MarketWatch expect the U.S. Labor Department to report that nonfarm employment rose by 215,000 jobs in June, compared with a May gain of 217,000 jobs.“Whatever about the specific rise in payrolls tomorrow, this report adds to the evidence that the labor market has strengthened further this year,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.ADP’s report echoes other recent jobs data showing that the labor market is firming, with layoff readings remaining near post-recession lows, and monthly nonfarm employment gains holding above 200,0000 since February. A report earlier this week showed that manufacturing employment continued to expand last month, a healthy sign for this sector.However, the economy is still particularly tough for many jobless workers, with about one-third of the unemployed looking for work for more than half a year.Details of ADP’s report showed private-sector job gains across a wide variety of businesses. Service providers added 230,000 jobs in June — the most since November 2012. Meanwhile, goods producers added 51,000 spots — the most since December 2012.Small businesses added 117,000 jobs, medium businesses added 115,000, and large businesses added 49,000.“The overall tone of this report was unambiguously positive,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy head, U.S. research and strategy, at TD Securities.Of note, private-sector construction employment rose by 36,000 last month, the largest gain since 2006. A particularly harsh winter hit the home-building industry, as well as the greater economy, and at least part of June’s gain may reflect a bounce back. Home builders themselves are perking up after a weak first quarter, though they still have concerns about sales.Also read: U.S. stock futures edge up after ADP dataHow to fly on a private jet for under $200 per person10 things rich people do better than you	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0F986D46-01E0-11E4-8F8A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

CORRECTED: Constellation Brands shares surge as profit, sales top estimates	(Corrects to show the Grupo Mondelo deal closed last year, not last month) NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Constellation Brands shares /quotes/zigman/267699/delayed/quotes/nls/stz STZ +0.77% surged more than 7% in premarket trade Wednesday after the company reported better-than-expected profit and sales for its fiscal first quarter. The drinks company, which owns Corona beer and Robert Mondavi wines among other brands, said it earned $207 million, or $1.03 a share, in the quarter. The company did not provide comparisons for the year-earlier period following the completion of the acquisition of Grupo Modelos U.S. beer business from Anheuser-Busch InBev /quotes/zigman/558553/delayed/quotes/nls/bud BUD +1.15% last year. It said it had adjusted per-share earnings of $1.07 for the quarter. Sales totaled $1.526 billion. The FactSet consensus was for per-share earnings of 93 cents and sales of $1.488 billion. The company said it is raising its fiscal 2015 outlook to reflect its strong beer sales and is now expecting adjusted per-shares earnings of $4.10 to $4.25.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=4F3925A3-6AC0-4A98-BCBF-931990F29762&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

U.S.-China talks show tension, but progress possible	By Laura He, MarketWatchAs U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew joined their Chinese counterparts in kicking off the sixth round of the nations’ Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED), there was clearly some tension.Reflecting this, Chinese President Xi Jinping felt the need to urge peace between Washington and Beijing when he addressed the opening ceremony of the dialogue Wednesday morning.“If any confrontation occurred between China and the U.S., it would definitely be a disaster to both countries and the whole world,” Xi said. “China, more than anytime else, needs a stable environment.”Kerry too stressed the need for cordial relations, saying the U.S. was not seeking to “contain” China, and repeating the U.S. mantra that it welcomes “the emergence of a peaceful, stable, prosperous China”, according to remarks carried by Reuters.Lew took a similar tone in his own comments: “We do not always agree, but our strong common interests are far more important than the individual challenges that we confront as a part of our overall bilateral relationship.”The remarks from both sides emphasized rapprochement, as the countries have found disagreement on a wide range of issues over recent months.These include U.S. allegations of Chinese military officers hacking U.S. companies’ data, growing territorial disputes between China and its neighbors, and political tensions in Hong Kong, where tens of thousands of people participated in a massive pro-democracy protest on July 1.The situation was enough to prompt former U.S. Treasury and S&ED veteran David Dollar to tell The Wall Street Journal that “”There seems to be a downward spiral in the relationship” between the U.S. and China.But if the geopolitical situation was a source of tension, agreement appeared more possible for some trade issues, specifically due to China’s decision to welcome its U.S. visitors by announcing plans to increase market access.On Tuesday, China’s official government website published a decree by the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, saying it would expand its “negative list” policy.While China currently restricts foreign investment to only certain industries, its newly established Shanghai Free Trade Zone has allowed global investors to buy into all sectors except for a few on a so-called negative list.In its Tuesday announcement, the State Council said this policy would now be expanded to include the entire country, a move widely seen as significantly increasing access to China’s markets.The State Council also reiterated its stance on letting “markets play a decisive role in allocating resources” and boost entrepreneurship and job creation by lowering entry barriers to those seeking to do business in China.China’s inflation eases (for now), leaving room for stimulusShaolin monks to create kung fu mobile app10 companies that put nearly all the food on supermarket shelves	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0FD79A40-0724-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
EU green-lights Telefónica’s $11.7 billion takeover of E-Plus	By Tom FairlessThe merger is seen by investors as a test case for how EU authorities will treat further deals in Europe’s rapidly consolidating telecoms sector. It will reduce the number of mobile operators in Europe’s most populous nation from four to three, a move that EU antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia had previously warned could lead to higher prices for consumers.The European Commission, which acts as the region’s central antitrust authority, gave the green light after Telefónica made a series of commitments aimed at supporting competition, including to sell up to 30% of the combined company’s spectrum to up to three so-called mobile virtual network operators. These operators provide mobile phone services using another company’s network.The EU’s approval is likely to spark further consolidation in the region’s fragmented telecoms sector, where larger operators are seeking to swallow smaller rivals to bolster falling revenues, analysts said.The commission’s blessing on the deal “sets a precedent” for how EU authorities will look at similar mergers in other large countries, said Mario Mariniello, an economist at think tank Bruegel in Brussels. The commission had previously approved four-to-three mobile-phone operator mergers in Austria and, most recently, Ireland, but not in a big EU country.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.comMore must-reads from MarketWatch:Lynn: Five surprises that could derail higher interest ratesWhy you’re still poor as Dow flirts with 17,000Where has 99% of the ocean’s trash gone?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5A954988-01D9-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02
10 things rich people do better than you	By Jocelyn Black HodesFinancially responsible and successful people don’t build their wealth by accident — or overnight. Becoming rich takes serious willpower and long-term vision. You have to be able to keep your eye on the prize of financial freedom, be willing to sacrifice your present wants for the sake of your future and develop good habits to win. Here are 10 habits you can start putting into practice now.Start earlyAs the old saying goes: The early bird catches the worm…or, in this case, gets to retire in style. The sooner you put your money to work, the more time it has to grow. Earning a paycheck, whether you are self-employed or work for a company, means the opportunity to contribute to an IRA, which you should seize ASAP. If you’re fortunate enough to get a job with a company that offers a matching contribution to their retirement plan, you need to make it a priority to enroll in the plan as soon as you are eligible. It can be the difference between retiring early and never retiring.Think about this: If you invested $10,000 and left it to grow for 40 years, assuming an average return per year of 8%, you would end up with over $217,000. But if you waited 10 years and invested $20,000 — twice as much — you would only end up with just over $200,000. Whatever your situation might be, saving and investing money today is better than waiting until tomorrow. Start now.AutomateYou can be your own worst enemy when it comes to financial success. It’s all too easy to procrastinate and neglect what needs to be done and, meanwhile, give in to temptation and spend more than you should. It’s the perfect recipe for not becoming rich. The best way to protect yourself from yourself is to automate your savings. That means setting up recurring transfers on a regular basis from your checking account to your savings and investment accounts (or setting up auto deduction from your paycheck to your employer-sponsored retirement plan). This way, you force yourself to avoid bad money habits and save what you would likely otherwise spend. If you haven’t already, set aside 15 minutes on your calendar now to do it. Not later, now. Your rich future self will thank you. Maximize contributionsWhen it comes to retirement account contributions, you’ve probably been told to start small and then try to increase the amount by at least 1% every year until you max out. If you’ve been procrastinating, then yes, even a small starting contribution is better than none. The problem is that small efforts can lead to small results. If you want to be rich, you have to save like you mean it. And that means contributing the max amount allowed from the get-go (and at least as much as your employer will match in your 401(k) plan). This is especially true if you are starting to save later in life and need to play catch up. You might worry that maxing out your contributions will squeeze your cash flow too tightly, but it is easier to get in the habit of spending less if you don’t have that extra to money to spend in the first place. It’s much harder to increasingly scale back your budget year after year to accommodate for increasing contributions. Never carry credit card balancesRevolving, high-interest debt is one of the biggest threats to your financial freedom. It can seriously drag you down, costing you thousands in unnecessary fees and interest charges — and prevent you from saving more. If you ever want to be rich, you have to ditch the bad habit of carrying credit card balances, along with the minimum payment mentality. Instead, you need to learn how to use credit wisely, rather than as a crutch, and commit to paying off your balances in full each month. Smart credit card holders know and practice the tricks to maximize rewards, points, discounts and monthly cash flow without getting in over their head. Of course, living within your means is key to your success.Live like you’re poorHave you ever met someone who is unassuming and modest and then were surprised to later learn that they are actually rolling in dough? I had an older client who was stuck in 1983: he wore ugly brown suits and running shoes, drove a beat-up baby blue Volvo station wagon and lived in the same modest house he bought 40 years ago. Turns out, this man was an uber-successful entrepreneur and multimillionaire — and even richer because of his humble habits.Millionaires are all around us, and many of them are probably not who you would think. This is because they smartly live below their means and save their money rather than showcase it. Of course, it’s easy to live below your means when you have millions, but even if you have far less, getting into the habit of spending minimally now will help you have a lot more later. The trick is adopting a “less is more” mentality and sticking with it, even when your income and net worth increase in the future.Avoid temptationThe temptation to live large and beyond our means is all around us: TV, magazines, friends, family, colleagues, “the Joneses.” It is nearly impossible to escape the pressure to spend, spend and then spend some more. The problem is that overspending often leads to debt accumulation, undersaving and long-term financial insecurity. Force yourself to avoid negative financial influences as much as possible. That means going cold turkey: Avoid malls, unsubscribe from all those retail emails and don’t sign up for new ones and say “no” to invitations that you know will cost you. Then, replace these temptations with things that motivate you.Be goal-orientedGoals inspire us, motivate us and give us purpose. Many of us have common goals, such as paying off debt, buying a house and retiring by a certain age. Maybe you have another goal of starting your own business or buying a second home. Unfortunately, goals are easily overshadowed by the daily stresses of life and all too often forgotten and neglected. When goals are just fleeting thoughts in your mind, they lose their meaning and influence over your behavior. This leads to bad financial habits, and your dream of becoming rich stays just that — a dream. To make it a reality, stay focused on your goals by committing the time to think about them, prioritize them and assign a target saving amount to each of them if possible. Then you should display your goals in places where you can be reminded on a regular basis, which will keep you accountable and help you stay on track. Get educatedSuccessful investors take the time to study key financial concepts, learn the dos and don’ts and stay abreast of current trends. They take advantage of opportunities to strengthen and expand their understanding and expose themselves to financial information on a daily basis. Take a cue from them and subscribe to The Wall Street Journal /quotes/zigman/18008448/delayed/quotes/nls/nws NWS +0.28%  , watch CNBC /quotes/zigman/89307/delayed/quotes/nls/cmcsa CMCSA +0.63%  , pick up Fortune /quotes/zigman/33562587/delayed/quotes/nls/time TIME +0.12%  instead of a gossip magazine and follow financial experts on Twitter /quotes/zigman/23556538/delayed/quotes/nls/twtr TWTR -1.05%  . Become a devoted student of money, and you can master the science of getting rich.Be careful not to overwhelm yourself, and only follow advice from credible sources, so you don’t fall victim to progress paralysis or unsuitable and potentially dangerous investments.Diversify your portfolioSuccessful investors also know not to put all of their money eggs in one basket—or two baskets, for that matter. They spread their wealth across a variety of investments, from stocks, mutual funds, ETFs and bonds, to real estate, collectibles and startups. A diversified portfolio means that you can potentially take advantage of multiple sources of growth and protect yourself from financial ruin if one of your investments bombs.An easy way to achieve diversification is to invest in an asset-allocation fund, such as a target-date fund or “life strategy” fund that is based on your risk tolerance. And if you don’t have the means to buy property outright, you can explore investing in real estate mutual funds, ETFs or investment trusts (REITs), which can even offer steady income in some cases. Learn more about crowdfunding, which now gives the average investor the ability to support startup companies. Just be careful not to concentrate your money too heavily in any one investment.Spend money to make moneyIt’s true that there’s a price to pay for wealth, but unless you’re Warren Buffett, it is not gambling — and losing — on stock picking. Impulse, naiveté, and emotions, particularly greed and fear, can seriously hinder your chances of being rich if you let them. The best way to protect yourself and get a step up on your financial goals is to first invest in a team of financial professionals. This means hiring a qualified and experienced financial adviser, accountant and in complex cases, an estate planner. Yes, working with pros will cost you, and you can still do some DIY investing, but their objectivity, expertise, personalized guidance and ongoing monitoring can be well worth it (and relieve you of the huge burden of figuring it all out on your own). Make sure that you interview several candidates so you can find pros you trust, feel comfortable with and whose approach is a good fit for your situation. And even if you work with an adviser, make sure that you’re still involved and aware of where your money is going — and why.Read these related stories:Ten reasons you’re not rich yetAsk an adviser: is it too late to start saving?Ten blue-chip stocks to stock up on	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=65F3ABEE-FCCA-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02
7 privacy rights you’re losing at work	By David Weidner, MarketWatchThe U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Hobby Lobby Stores Inc. case Monday underscored how traditional workplace privacy and protections are being eroded. In the ruling, the court allowed Hobby Lobby, a crafts-store chain, an exemption to a requirement in the Affordable Care Act. The store owners won’t be required to pay for contraceptives they consider immoral.Not only will the ruling restrict access to health care for female workers at the company, it places a new restriction on all workers by subjecting them to the personal religious beliefs of managers.But Hobby Lobby is just the latest example of how the workplace is becoming ever more micro-managed at the expense of personal privacy. Here are just a few examples of how these protections we used to take for granted have been taken away in recent years.1. Your boss is in your phone. It’s not only company-issued phones that can be monitored by your employer. The most recent trend in the workplace is for employees to be required to buy their own personal smartphones for work use, a practice called BYOD , or “bring your own device.” A study by Gartner, an Internet technology research firm, predicts that if current trends hold, half of employers will require BYOD by 2017. Because these devices access company servers and networks, companies can legally access them.2. If you leave, we will control your future. It used to be that non-compete agreements were used only to keep company secrets away from competitors: a salesman or professional with a client list, a chef who knew the recipe for the secret sauce or a CEO who knew, well, everything. Today, just about everyone can be required to sign a non-compete. They’re more common not only for a range of jobs in industries like tech and medicine, but also in service-oriented fields. The growth of non-compete contracts in the labor market aren’t just a way to control the future of an employee, they are being blamed for holding back the economy.3. Say cheese. You’re being watched. Once the domain of retail stores, video surveillance is on the rise in almost every trade and profession. Half of all companies use video surveillance in some form, 7% of them monitor employee performance. About half of employers monitor phones, track numbers and about one in 10 companies listen to voicemail. A few companies use global positioning systems to monitor company vehicles and phones, and a tiny percentage, 1%, can track your ID and work-site access card, according to the American Management Association.4. And so is your computer. The AMA, which has been tracking the tracking for more than a decade, shows just how pervasive and invasive employers are. More than 65% of companies monitor computer and Internet use, and one of 10 companies reviews worker participation on social networks. And it’s not passive watching. For instance, 28% of employers have fired workers for email misuse, and 30% have fired workers for inappropriate Internet use.5. Forced prayer. Hobby Lobby may have received the most attention via its Supreme Court case but, believe it or not, religion in the workplace isn’t limited to Oklahoma-based crafts chains. In New York, United Health Programs of America is being sued by the federal government for discriminatory practices. UHPA made employees pray, discuss personal matters with colleagues and read spiritual texts. Between 1999 and 2009, religious-discrimination claims increased 87%, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And you don’t even have to be in a religious setting to be discriminated against. Three Arab Muslim employees at a car dealership in Chicago were subjected to offensive slurs by managers. The dealership was fined $100,000.6. Vote our way, or else ... The 2012 election cycle was marked by calls by employers to have workers vote a particular way. An executive at Koch Industries warned its 45,000 employees to vote against President Obama or “suffer the consequences, including higher gasoline prices, runaway inflation, and other ills.” Others, including David Siegel, chief executive of Westgate Resorts, told employees: “I will have no choice but to reduce the size of this company.”7. Testing, checking and screening. In recent years it’s become common practice to screen job applicants’ credit histories, arrest records and driving records. You can be rejected if there’s an error on your credit report, you were found “not guilty” or your employer doesn’t like rolling stops. And more than half (58%) of U.S. companies conduct alcohol or drug screenings, according to a study released this year bv HireRight Inc. There are no federal laws that prohibit the practice. And Ronald Reagan pushed through the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 through an executive order, requiring some federal contractors and all grantees to go “drug-free.” Sadly, 37% of drug-test results are wrong, a study by the Centers for Disease Control shows. But that doesn’t help prospective employees, as they’ll be knocked out of contention without knowing it.More from MarketWatch:Hobby Lobby wins one for company double standardsEconomy this year will be no better than last yearStartling news for investors, Yellen and Congress	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=6ED1B276-0128-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

July 4th gas prices highest since 2008 thanks to Iraq	By Myra P. Saefong, MarketWatchCrude prices haven’t even gained more than $1 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange since turmoil in Iraq hit the headlines in the first half of June.“North American oil prices have advanced by just a few pennies since Iraqi violence put a question mark around the future stability of supply, but U.S. consumers will still see the most expensive July 4th gasoline prices in six years,” according to analysts at GasBuddy.com.Despite the fact that U.S. oil production is as high as it’s been since October 1986 and gasoline should be well supplied in all states during the holiday, “fear about what could happen if Iraqi exports fall prey to violence has altered the calculus for summer oil prices,” said GasBuddy chief oil analyst Tom Kloza.Nymex crude futures /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.28%  closed at $104.35 a barrel June 10, when militants known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) captured Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city. Oil futures have gained 99 cents since then, closing at $105.34 as of Tuesday’s settlement.Fuel prices have also climbed, modestly — with the average price for regular gasoline up just about 2 cents since then as of Monday’s $3.676 a gallon, according to AAA .“The big news to us is that gas prices were heading down before the fall of Mosul,” said Michael Green, a spokesman for AAA. “Gas prices typically fall in June, but we didn’t see that this year due to the renewed conflict in Iraq. Most consumers are paying about 15-20 cents per gallon more than they would have been paying otherwise.”AAA had predicted about a month ago that national average gasoline prices could decline 10 to 15 cents a gallon in June, as refineries complete maintenance and raise output for the summer driving season. But the “unexpected events in Iraq,” prevented that from happening, the leisure travel and motorist group said in its monthly gas price report.The average price of gas in June was $3.67 a gallon — the most expensive for June since 2011 and the highest average for any month since March of last year, according to AAA.The U.S. isn’t as dependent on Middle Eastern oil as it was even as recently as three years ago, according to GasBuddy.com, a source for real-time local gas prices.Still, “the global market could be nervous about Iraq from now through the peak weeks of the Atlantic hurricane season,” and the “potential loss of all or part of the 2.6 million-barrels-per-day of Iraqi oil that moves to consuming countries may keep prices higher than they might be under more peaceful circumstances,” GasBuddy.com analysts said.That makes sense, given that 66% of the price for a gallon of gasoline is crude oil.Ryan Mossman, vice president and general manager of FuelQuest’s Fuel Services, expects gasoline prices to “curb to levels more in line with this time of year over the coming weeks unless the conflict in Iraq moves to southern Iraq, where the majority of the countries’ fuel supply lies.”	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CB7E4BD6-015C-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02
Check out these horrible stock picks — they’re mine	By Jeff Reeves, MarketWatchThe Internet never forgets, and never pulls punches. Just when I think I’ve finally moved past a bad call, somebody quotes it word for word in a snarky email.And, of course, the Internet also found out very quickly that I am a handmaiden for the Federal Reserve/Goldman Sachs/Barack Obama/our alien overlords. I foolishly thought I could keep those conflicts under wraps, but alas, my secret is out!Anyway, I’ve learned a lot after six years of being in the public eye as a pundit and stock picker, but one of the most important things I’ve learned is that honesty, humility and a sense of humor count for a lot in this business.To that end, a few times a year (most recently here and here) I voluntarily lock myself in the dunk tank and put out a bushel of softballs for anyone to throw my way.It’s that time again, so have at it!I do this because the exercise reminds me of just how flawed I am as an investor, and that I have to work constantly to improve and overcome my biases. I also choose to do this publicly in the hope that it will remind others of their selfsame shortcomings.I did get a few things right, of course. But nobody likes a braggart, so instead, let’s explore the dumbest things I have said (so far!) this year:Facebook facepalmThe dumbest call I had was so bad, I decided to own up to it immediately. In a nutshell, I predicted soft earnings for Facebook /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB -0.24%  thanks to a one-two punch of flat-lining user growth and serious challenges in squeezing more money out of that user base.Facebook’s stock actually jumped by double digits on strong earnings, and is up 23% since I decided to wave the caution flag. Oops!And to make me look even worse, I am still sticking to this call. Facebook faces saturation for Western users, who are the most profitable for Facebook, and faces real challenges as online ad competitors like Google /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%  and Yahoo /quotes/zigman/59898/delayed/quotes/nls/yhoo YHOO +0.72% continue to feel the pressure of declining ad rates. Heck, a recent Gallup poll said Facebook ads are even less effective than conventional display ads on Yahoo.com to boot!Of course, I have been steadily and consistently wrong on Facebook’s stock, in part, because I am imprinting my own knowledge of media onto the company’s ad-based model, so what do I know? You may want to use my skepticism as a bullish case, considering the last time I opened my fat mouth, investors made a quick 20% on the other side of the trade.Big Oil burns brightlyIn early March, I mused on the death of Big Oil in an era of weak demand, expensive-to-access supplies and a lack of inflation.Well, the energy sector has powered higher ever since, thanks to the “risk premium” brought about by unrest in Ukraine and Iraq. Furthermore, inflation has started to pick up again, particularly for energy prices.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=6692A6EE-012B-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

India’s new government is investors’ latest challenge	By Satyajit DasBut their expectations may be too high.Prime Minister Modi and his conservative Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are professional politicians, close to influential wealthy and business groups. The BJP spent an estimated US$500-700 million on its election campaign, presumably financed by its supporters in expectation of favorable policy decisions.Business interests that support the BJP are rarely concerned with long-term structural reforms. They favor stock-market driven artificial wealth, based on preferential access to government contracts, fast-tracking of approval for their projects, access to land, commodities, and other natural resources at attractive prices, and access to capital from state-controlled domestic banks.On important issues, these business interests will complicate policy-making. In manufacturing, some believe that India has no future and should not seek to compete. Others favor high-value-added, advanced technology manufacturing. Another group champions labor-intensive low-tech industries, such as clothing, leather and food processing. All agree, however, that the government should subsidize their preferred strategy.The BJP won only 31% of the popular vote and does not have a majority in the Indian upper house (the Rajya Shoba), commanding just 63 of the 250 seats. The BJP will have to work with the upper house to pass major legislation related to the constitution, taxes and foreign investment.The new government will also have to work with India’s many state governments on matters outside its jurisdiction. The states are dominated by regional political parties, which received around 50% of the national vote. The government also will have to deal with a bureaucracy resistant to change and an independent central bank led by a formidable, well-credentialed governor.Moreover, Modi’s Hindu nationalist philosophy and alleged complicity in the Gujarat race riots may prove divisive. Only around 10% of India’s substantial Muslim population voted for the BJP. During the campaign, leaders of one radical Hindu organization affiliated with the BJP argued that Indian Muslims should not be allowed to buy property in Hindu areas. Modi disapproved of that statement. However, in Gujarat, the state of which Modi was the chief minister, there is strong evidence of Muslim marginalization. And Modi’s decision to celebrate his victory with a Hindu religious ceremony in the city of Varanasi was a poor signal for a harmonious secular India.The post-election period has provided few clues as to how Modi and the BJP plan to satisfy the electorate and financial markets. In a statement to parliament in early June, the new government announced a series of “national missions,” including high-speed trains and 100 new cities with “world-class amenities.” India would be transformed into a globally competitive manufacturing hub, powered by “skill, scale and speed.” But no details were provided as to how all of this would be achieved.The embrace of large scale infrastructure and manufacturing is interesting given Modi’s views that India’s requirements are different from China, and require a balance between agriculture, small- and large businesses.Investors evidently have forgotten that Modi’s less-charismatic and less-controversial predecessor Manmohan Singh, a professional economist, was once hailed by the same constituencies as India’s savior. Singh was once considered the “architect of modern India” and drove important changes that paved the way for strong economic growth. But by the 2014 election, Singh was viewed as indecisive, weak, and a puppet for interests of the Congress party.British politician Tony Benn once observed that all political careers ultimately end in failure. It remains to be seen if Modi can bring about the necessary changes or join a long line of Indian leaders who did not live up to their promise.More from MarketWatch:5 reasons India stock bulls are too optimisticDow nears 17,000, but most investors have missed outTime to take stock of your money and investing success	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=61FBFB92-00A6-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02
Boomer travel: Planning a trip to Antarctica	Antarctica is expected to attract about 37,000 travelers in late 2014 and early 2015. In the late 1950s, when tourists first ventured to the region, about 500 visited each tourism season, according to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators.Increasingly, “you’ve got a lot of folks who want to check the seventh continent off their travel list,” said Jim Taylor, co-owner of Polar Cruises in Bend, Ore. People also want to ogle armies of waddling penguins, be dazzled by glacial vistas or follow in the footsteps of famous polar explorers.All those aspects inspired Linda Kennedy and her husband, a retired couple in Eden Prairie, Minn., to sign up for a trip last November. “Growing up in Iowa, I was always intrigued” by polar travel, she says. “Back then you just didn’t hear about trips going down to Antarctica.”Today, more than 50 ships ply the Antarctic waters, offering a wide variety of itineraries (from 8-10 days to three weeks), optional activities (kayaking, camping overnight on the Antarctic Peninsula, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing) and amenities (including four-star dining).If you’re thinking about a visit, here’s what to consider.The basicsCosts range from $5,000 aboard the least-expensive ships to $25,000 and more for the plushest cabins on the longest trips. That’s without round-trip airfare to departure ports, usually Ushuaia, Argentina, or Punta Arenas, Chile.Most trips take place between November and March—spring and summer in the Southern Hemisphere. That doesn’t mean it’s balmy; you still have to wear a parka and bring extra layers. But Ms. Kennedy said the weather during her November trip was more than manageable. “It was about 20 degrees back home, whereas in the Antarctic it was usually around 30,” she said.The Antarctic is a lot brighter, too, especially since sunlight can extend for 20 hours a day in the warmer months. “You had to wear sunscreen,” said Deborah Fogarty, a retired teacher from Jackson Heights, N.Y., who made the trek with her husband in February.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7F854CAC-FD60-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02
J.P. Morgan’s Jamie Dimon diagnosed with throat cancer	By Emily GlazerDimon, 58 years old, said he has briefed the bank’s board on his health. He said in a memo that he will limit his travel during the roughly eight-week-long radiation and chemotherapy treatment. Business will run as normal during that period, he said.Joe Evangelisti, a company spokesman, said there isn’t a specific individual who will take over Dimon’s responsibilities as his schedule eases while he undergoes treatment this summer. Individual business heads will continue as usual. The board has succession plans focusing on immediate, three-year and five-to-seven-year time frames, Evangelisti said, adding that there is a deep bench.The cancer was caught quickly and confined to one area, Dimon said in the memo. He had tests including a CT scan and a biopsy and learned the cancer is in his throat and the adjacent lymph nodes on the right side of his neck.“Importantly, there is no evidence of cancer elsewhere in my body,” Dimon said in the memo. His evaluation and treatment plan are still in the works, according to the memo. “I feel very good now and will let all of you know if my health situation changes,” he said in the memo.

Judge drops two more counts in Rengan Rajaratnam case	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- A New York judge dismissed two insider trading charges against Rengan Rajaratnam on Tuesday, according to The Wall Street Journal. The younger brother of convicted felon Raj Rajaratnam is on trial in New York for allegations of insider trading. The judge in the case said there is not enough evidence that he made the illegal trades. These most-recent dismissals bring six total number of securities-fraud charges that have been dropped against Rengan in the past two months, leaving one charge of conspiracy still standing. The prosecution has rested its case against Rengan Rajaratnam in his currently ongoing trial. Older brother Raj Rajaratnam is currently serving an 11 year prison sentence.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A7E47945-4FB1-4AC7-AC72-4C49ABE7BCBA&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01

Five surprises that could derail higher interest rates	By Matthew LynnIn Britain, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has suggested that rates will have to rise in the autumn. In the U.S., the speculation is that spring might be the time Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen starts edging rates back up again.It is not hard to understand why. Both economies are growing at respectable levels again. Jobs are being created. House prices are rising, especially in the U.K. While there are still plenty of challenges, it is hard to see what the economic emergency is any more that requires rates to be held at 300-year-lows.Even so, the markets are wrong to assume rates will rise, even if that is the current plan. Why not? Because there are at least five surprises that could derail rate rises between now and the autumn.Such as? A geopolitical crisis in Russia or the Middle East. Deflation spreading out of the euro zone into the rest of the world. A collapse in the stock market. A banking crisis. Or a government falling. In reality, neither Carney or Yellen have any real idea how the global economy will look in six months or a year.Rates will go up one day, when circumstances demand it, but any attempt at forward guidance on when that might be is completely pointless.There is little question that the plan among central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic is to start nudging interest rates back to a normal level. The timing may still be vague, but the intention is not. Rates were slashed to three-century lows after the crash of 2008 and have stayed there ever since.But both economies are steadily recovering. Keeping rates too low for too long risks permanently distorting the economy. Worse, if rates don’t start to rise at this point in the cycle, there won’t be any room to cut them next time the economy turns down.The trouble is a lot can happen between now and the autumn, and even more before next spring. Such as? Here are five events that could easily derail a rate rise.First, a geopolitical crisis. The stand-off between Russia and Ukraine remains as tense as ever, even if it is not dominating the headlines any more. Iraq is descending into a civil war that could easily drag Turkey and Iran into a wider regional conflict. With the U.S. understandably withdrawing from its role as a global policeman, there is far more potential for small wars to break out between unstable states.As the centenary of the First World War should remind us, small wars can easily turn into big ones. Any sign of that happening would send the global economy into a slump — and make any talk of a rate rise redundant.Second, deflation spreading. No one ever thought inflation would be contained within one country, so there is no reason why deflation should be either. The euro zone, which remains the world’s largest economy bloc, is sliding inevitably towards falling prices. Inflation data, released on Monday, showed prices rising at just 0.5% across the continent, well below target. Prices are now falling in countries such as Greece, Cyprus and Portugal.Europe is a major exporter, so if its prices fall, they will start to fall in other countries as well. Inflation is already well below target in the U.K., and it could spread to the U.S. as well. No central bank is going to raise rates when prices are going down.Three, a stock market collapse. You can argue all day long about whether the markets are dangerously overvalued, or whether they are just at the start of another long bull market to rival those of the 1980s and 1990s. No one really knows.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=2E995548-0122-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-02

China’s wild auto-parts market scares away Germans	By Bao ZhimingStahlgruber sold its subsidiary on June 23 to Shanghai Lingtu Trade Co., a Chinese company in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, company registration documents show. Lingtu is owned by Qing Yan, the former general manager of Stahlgruber’s China subsidiary.“The complexity of China’s auto-parts market was beyond [Stahlgruber’s] imagination,” Qing said.Because China has a large variety of car models and thus standards, the auto-parts market is “chaotic” and saturated with individually owned small repair shops, an industry source said.International auto parts giants who have tried to bring a standardized operating model to China usually fail, he said. “It is like having a well-equipped, disciplined army good at fighting in cities try to fight in the jungle,” the source said.The National Automotive Parts Association, the American auto-parts juggernaut known as NAPA, tried to expand its business in Beijing and Shanghai in the late 1990s, but soon left because its performance fell short of expectations. Citigroup Inc.’s /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C +0.48%  investment in Youpei.com, a Chinese auto-parts chain, in 2006 also failed.Established in 1923, Stahlgruber became Europe’s largest auto-parts distribution and service provider by sales in 2010.The German company opened its China branch in January 2011 in Shanghai. It wanted to integrate resources from international and Chinese auto-parts providers and to introduce a standardized model for procurement, marketing and sales, storage, shipping and customer service, the company said.Products included engines, lights, air systems and oil. Stahlgruber also planned to set up an online store and offered training and marketing help to its Chinese partners.“We tried to build a one-stop service connecting auto-parts factories to repair shops, but the German operating model was difficult to apply to China’s complicated market,” Qing said. “Auto-parts providers do not share information with each other, so in the end, we couldn’t even figure out the product numbers of the parts we sold. Information asymmetry was a big issue … and put a lot of pressure on our inventory and cash flow.”But Qing said he was optimistic a more standardized auto-parts market could develop in China.“Even though the Germans left, it doesn’t mean their model is a failure,” he said. “As more and more cars get out of the warranty period, owners will increasingly rely on shops other than the dealers, so the room for the auto-parts market in China is still large.”See this report at Caixin Online .

Private jets for less than the cost of coach, and the case for shipping your luggage	By Priya Anand, MarketWatchThe cost of flying continues to rise. One way to save? Take a private jet. A handful of sites and private jet companies offer last-minute deals on unused inventory, with some recent fares at just $499 for a group of four to fly from Los Angeles to Cabo San Lucas, or $179 per person for a trip from New Jersey to the Bahamas. Can’t wait until the last minute to snag a private jet deal? Then you might as well ship your luggage — it’s both cheaper and less of a hassle.New car prices increased 1.4% in June over last year. General Motors booked the biggest increases, at 5.4%, despite news of recalls and a government investigation into whether the company committed fraud by hiding the defect. “The ignition switch problem is understandable and people don’t find it so unusual or scary,” one analyst tells MarketWatch.Why you’re still poor as the market hits record highs.How are the kids doing?

The headline dipped to 55.3 from 55.4. The new orders measure rose to 58.9 from 56.9. The employment measure held steady at 52.8.

The economy is growing but slowly enough for the Fed to keep rates low for a while.  And positive number from China today boosted confidence among investors as it bodes well for global economy.”Doss cautioned about complacency in the market.“There is a lot of complacency as we can see from very low levels in the Vix index, which makes us cautious. We are hedging our portfolios against a pullback. But if there is a 10% correction we will use it to buy undervalued stocks.”Wall Street kicks off July with a rally. And the maker of Spam and Skippy has muscled its way into a deal.

Puerto Rico gets 3 notch super-downgrade: Moodys	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Puerto Rico bonds backed by the commonwealths taxing power were cut three notches to B2 from Ba2 by Moodys Investors Service on Tuesday. The downgrade of its general obligation debt, which leaves the bonds five notches below investment grade, reflects the enactment of a new law that allows the struggling islands public corporations to restructure their bonds. By providing for defaults by certain issuers that the central government has long supported, Puerto Ricos new law marks the end of the commonwealths long history of taking actions needed to support its debt, said the Moodys analysts, led by Edward Hampton. Bonds backed by the islands sales-tax revenue were also cut. Puerto Rico passed the restructuring law last week, resulting in immediate downgrades to its agency debt from all three major rating services. Moodys took additional action on the sale-tax debt and general obligation bonds because it said the new law impacts all Puerto Rico bonds, beyond those referenced in the law. The laws passage has put investors on edge about a potential default, sending prices on the agency-backed debt sharply lower. Puerto Rico lost its investment-grade rating from all three rating agencies in February.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E127A621-DB12-4A34-9687-07E1005A1D53&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01
10-year Treasury yield hits highest in a week	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe 10-year note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR 0.00%  yield, which rises as prices fall, was up 5 basis points on the day at 2.568%, its highest level since last Tuesday. The benchmark yield marked its biggest first-half drop in four years.Stocks surged to new record highs, pulling some demand from the safety of the Treasury market. With the boost from month-end and quarter-end purchases fading, U.S. government debt prices began weakening overnight. Treasurys pushed lower after a U.K. manufacturing report jumped unexpectedly in June.Treasurys briefly cut losses after a trio of U.S. economic news. Manufacturing companies grew at a slower pace in June; the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index unexpectedly slipped to 55.3% in June, from 55.4% in May. But in a sign of future economic strength, new orders jumped to the highest level since the end of 2013.Construction spending rose 0.1% in May, below economist expectations of a 0.7% reading. The final U.S. Markit manufacturing PMI slipped to 57.3 in June, from a preliminary reading of 57.5, but nonetheless posted the highest monthly reading since 2010.More broadly, improvement in economic indicators has quickened in recent months, suggesting a pickup in the economy after growth contracted in the first quarter. Nonetheless, the economy continues to grow a relatively slow pace, which limits the back-up in long-term yields, according to Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at Prudential Fixed Income.“It’s hard to see Treasury yields pushing up toward 3%,” on the 10-year note in the near-term, Tipp said.Investors have continued to expect that the Federal Reserve will maintain its low-rate monetary policies until it sees signs that labor-force weaknesses have vanished. Growing wages, as measured in monthly jobs reports through average hourly earnings, would be one sign of that improvement.Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will speak on Wednesday, and the Labor Department will release its monthly jobs report for June on Thursday.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR 0.00%  yield rose 6 basis points to 3.400% and the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR 0.00%  yield rose 3.5 basis points to 1.659%, according to Tradeweb.Why bond contrarians are beating the vigilantesOne chart explains the unexpected first-half Treasury rallyThese two debt payments may be heard around the world	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=14C4E5F8-0120-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01

White House declines to comment on BNP share rise	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to comment Tuesday on the jump in BNP Paribas SA stock price in the wake of its record $9 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over trade sanctions violations. The companys shares are up 3.6% in afternoon trading. Asked about the rise in BNP shares and a similar rise in Credit Suisse AGs [s:CS] shares in May after it agreed to a plea deal with federal prosecutors and paid a $2.6 billion penalty, Earnest said the White House would not second-guess Justice Department prosecutors. BNP said it has ample cash to cover U.S. penalties. On Monday, the bank also said it intended to pay a dividend of EUR 1.5 ($2.05) a share on 2014 earnings.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C9DF45ED-140C-4972-901F-A8A60F360771&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01
Jeffrey Gundlachs flagship fund has 5th monthly inflow	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Jeffrey Gundlachs flagship DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund /quotes/zigman/593786/realtime DBLTX 0.00% had an inflow of $527 million in June, marking the fifth consecutive month of positive flows, according to data provided by the asset manager on Tuesday.

The fund has outperformed 67% of its peers so far this year, according to Morningstar. Gundlach is widely followed because of his investment calls, which included a correct prediction that 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR 0.00% yields would fall from around 3% toward 2.50%. The yield is currently at 2.57%.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7E55C262-5979-40FB-ACC8-4969640CEF1D&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01
Growth stocks are doing most bullish thing they can	By Kevin MarderThe chart below shows how pullbacks have been brief and of the simple-retracement variety, as opposed to more complex “A-B-C” patterns.For a larger chart, please click here .Chart created using TradeStation . ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2014. All rights reserved.In terms of the major averages, the Naz has shown steady outperformance for nearly two months. This is a significant plus for any market cycle, as the index is a proxy for growth, technology, and small-capitalization shares, all generally considered to be more speculative.For a larger chart, please click here .Chart created using TradeStation . ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2014. All rights reserved.At the same time, fundamentally sound growth shares continue to set up and break out of bases. This normally occurs for roughly three months or so subsequent to the outset of an intermediate-term advance.During March, April and early May, this column was concerned that the growth sector had ceded leadership to value/cyclical issues, as is normally the case in a mature bull market. At the time, few growth titles stirred.However, institutions, reflecting an increased level of comfort surrounding the then-nascent advance in the averages, began staking out positions in some of the liquid glamours. Come late May, a few liquid glamours such as Priceline Group /quotes/zigman/90481/delayed/quotes/nls/pcln PCLN +0.43% and Google /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%  started to materially outperform.While these names soon saw their rallies fizzle out, others quickly took their place. Along these lines, the importance of flexibility and an open-minded approach to new technical developments cannot be overestimated.Among the names, Gilead Sciences /quotes/zigman/72849/delayed/quotes/nls/gild GILD +0.92% is the largest-capitalization biotechnology concern. It is expected to grow earnings by 208% in 2014, followed by another 24% in 2015, per most Wall Street seers who keep tabs on the shares. The companys line of business is in the areas of viral, fungal, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.This is an 89th percentile stock when ranked according to relative price strength over the past year. Its industry group is in the 87th percentile. In the last two quarters, the number of mutual funds has grown from 2,495 to 2,563 to 2,694, respectively.Technically, GILD appears poised to clear the top of its four-month base-with-handle pattern. As such, an aggressive speculator might consider using the base top of 84.88 (the Feb. 25 high) as an entrance pivot. As always, a junior position (half normal) is suggested initially. This can then be added on to in the event the stock proves itself. A standard stop of 6%-7% is considered reasonable as a means of protecting capital from any potential loss.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F27D08EB-09C7-45E9-9D5E-79AA8A4CDDA9&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01

Oil futures fail to hold to $106, log fourth straight decline	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchOn the New York Mercantile Exchange, August oil /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.28%  fell 3 cents to settle at $105.34 a barrel. Prices, which fell over the past three trading sessions, had touched a high of $106.09, but also slipped below $105 during the trading session.On the ICE Futures exchange, the August Brent contract /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -0.38% shed 7 cents, or 0.1%, to end at $112.29 a barrel.“With nothing too market-moving regarding developments on the geopolitical front, crude is holding steady ahead of the next deluge of data … in a thinner-traded holiday week to boot,” said Matt Smith, a commodity analyst at Schneider Electric.The U.S. government will report weekly data on petroleum supplies on Wednesday and release its monthly jobs report on Thursday.Meanwhile, Ukraine forces battled pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country after Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko declared an end to a 10-day unilateral cease-fire, renewing concerns over the potential for disruptions to global oil production.Economic data Tuesday was mostly supportive for energy demand.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s more closely-followed report is due Wednesday morning.Analysts polled by Platts expect to see a drawdown of 2 million barrels in crude-oil inventories as of the week ended June 27.

American Capital Agency pays out a dividend yield of 11.79% of the current stock price.On June 26, it paid out its most recent quarterly dividend: $0.65 per share.In addition to Mr.Soros, other fund managers are profiting from American Capital Agencys dividend yield. David Einhorn s Greenlight Capital holds 5.238 million shares of the company. This position, worth $112 million, was started over Q1, and has last paid Greenlight Capital more than $3.4 million in dividends.Second in this list is Mack Cali Realty Corp /quotes/zigman/208003/delayed/quotes/nls/cli CLI -0.98% , a $1.9 billion market cap self-administered, self-managed real estate investment trust that has George Soros as its largest hedge fund shareholder.

However, the dividend was cut to half, and the upcoming payment of $0.15 will account for 2.75% (annualized value) of the current stock price.

Gold futures mark highest close since mid-April	By Myra P. Saefong and Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatchGold for August delivery /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.05%  rose $4.60, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,326.60 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Tracking the most-active contracts, prices marked their highest settlement since April 14. On Monday, the yellow metal edged up on the day and ended with a 6.1% gain for June.In Ukraine on Tuesday, that country’s forces deployed aircraft and artillery against pro-Russian separatists in the east, according to a Wall Street Journal article. Fighting has intensified after Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko declared an end to a 10-day unilateral cease-fire that had failed to stop the violence in the region.Adding to geopolitical worries, Israeli warplanes carried out airstrikes in Gaza on Tuesday to exact revenge for the deaths of three teens, while Iraq’s new parliament failed to give Nouri al-Maliki another term as prime minister, according to reports from the WSJ.“Gold is being supported by Iraq and now Ukraine,” said Chintan Karnani, chief market analyst at Insignia Consultants, based in New Delhi.“However, the rise in U.S. manufacturing new orders to the highest since December is preventing sharp gains for gold,” he said. “U.S. economic data releases so far in June and today suggests that higher energy prices have not had a huge impact on U.S. consumption and growth — and is the key reason why gold is creeping higher and not zooming.”A rally among U.S. equities also drew some investors’ attention away from the precious metal.Gold prices have also benefited from news that holdings in the largest gold exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust /quotes/zigman/41663/delayed/quotes/nls/gld GLD -0.42% , saw their largest increase in five weeks on Monday, according to Jones Trading’s Dave Lutz. Gold holdings rose to 25.4 million ounces on Monday from 25.2 million ounces on Friday.In other metals trading, October platinum /quotes/zigman/19534176/delayed PLV4 -0.34% jumped $32.10, or 2.2%, to end at $1,515 an ounce.

8 Companies that saw big hedge fund moves	By Meena KrishnamsettyLast Thursday, Richard McGuire s Marcato Capital Management revealed that it had increased its exposure – by 185%-to Lear Corporation /quotes/zigman/576471/delayed/quotes/nls/lea LEA +1.00% , a $7.2 billion market cap company engaged in the business of supplying seating and electrical distribution systems and other related components to virtually every major automotive manufacturer in the world. The fund had decreased its holdings at the company by 75% over Q1, to 1.4 million shares. However, McGuire seems, once again, bullish about Lear Corporation, holding 4.01 million shares. This position, worth about $355 million, represent 4.9% of the companys stock.Marcato Capital also boosted its stake in another company last week. The fund disclosed a 6.4% increase in its position at Life Time Fitness, Inc. /quotes/zigman/350115/delayed/quotes/nls/ltm LTM +0.35% , a company engaged in designing, building and operating distinctive and large, multi-use sports and athletic, professional fitness, family recreation and spa centers, with a market cap barely shy of $2 billion. McGuires fund acknowledged ownership of 3.115 million shares, which account for 7.6% of this companys outstanding stock.The fund had started this activist position on May 12, when it acquired almost 2.93 million shares. Other major funds betting on this company are Phill Gross and Robert Atchinsons Adage Capital Management, with 575,000 shares (a position started over Q1), and Glenn J. Krevlins Glenhill Advisors , with 436,079 shares, up 190% over 2014s first quarter.Another fund that declared an increase in two of its equity positions last week is Citadel Advisors, managed by billionaire Ken Griffin . The fund declared having boosted its exposure to Rice Energy Inc /quotes/zigman/26158982/delayed/quotes/nls/rice RICE -0.89% , a $4 billion market cap independent natural gas and oil company that IPOed at the beginning of 2014, and Spansion Inc. /quotes/zigman/597819/delayed/quotes/nls/code CODE +1.36% , a $1.3 billion market cap semiconductor device company. The fund declared a 45% increase in both its positions. It now owns more than 7 million shares of Rice Energy, and 3.44 million shares of Spansion Inc. These holdings account for 5.5% and 5.7% of these companies outstanding stock, respectively.Earlier last week, Citadel Advisors had -also- upped its position at DSW Inc. /quotes/zigman/372549/delayed/quotes/nls/dsw DSW +3.54% , a $2.55 billion market cap branded footwear and accessories retailer. According to its latest filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the fund owns 4.54 million shares of Class A Common Stock, up from 4.48 million shares reported previously.Most recently, Chase Coleman s Tiger Global Management started a position with 2.496 million shares at Zhaopin Ltd /quotes/zigman/33402909/delayed/quotes/nls/zpin ZPIN 0.00% , a $1.46 billion market cap Chinese online recruitment platform operator that IPOed in early June.On the opposite sidewalk, we found Ryman Hospitality Properties Inc. /quotes/zigman/12068263/delayed/quotes/nls/rhp RHP -0.61% . This $2.4 billion market cap real estate investment trust specializing in group-oriented, destination hotel assets in urban and resort markets saw Mario Gabellis Gamco Investors recently trim its stake slightly , from 4.96 million shares to 4.94 million shares. This position, worth about $237 million at the current stock price, accounts for approximately 9.72% of the companys outstanding stock. Zac Hirzels Hirzel Capital Management also decreased its exposure to Ryman Hospitality Properties recently (over the last reported quarter) by 15%, to 1.479 million shares.A little bonus: Republic Services Inc. /quotes/zigman/225206/delayed/quotes/nls/rsg RSG +0.26% , a $13.3 billion market cap provider of services in the domestic non-hazardous solid waste industry has been seeing Bill Gates Cascade Investments buy its stock in two separate occasions. Cascade Investments now owns 90.06 million shares of the companys common stock.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=6E3E5DFA-D5F6-4C9E-919C-2294A3872DD7&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01
It’s time for the ECB to go all in	By L.A. LittleLike Bernanke, Super Mario has a tool chest — and to hear him talk, it, too, is a deep one. He carries it around proudly and has threatened to pull his tools out and use them time and time again. There are the historically boring tools like deposit, discount and overnight lending rates, and then there are the more creative and newer tools like long-term refinancing operations (LTRO) and the more recent targeted lending to non-financial corporates (TLTRO) which was rolled out last month.The latter idea is that the ECB will step up and make loans where loans arent being made — to businesses. But the big bazooka, as outsiders like to call it, is still in the tool chest, and that is a broad-based asset-purchase program (QE, essentially). Will Super Mario end up as a one and done, or will he surprise us again come Thursday?If you look at the markets to see what they are saying, the impression is that ECB has already done what its going to do and nothing more is to come anytime soon. That has been the odds-on bet with Europe throughout the six-year crisis. They have been the laggard by a long margin in the creative financing world, and why should the market expect that cautious approach to be cast aside. If Draghi is really going to shake things up, breaking that mind-set is the first order of business. To make the markets believe , he has to continue show his shiny tools — to give them light. He has to proceed with the idea of mortgage-backed securities purchases, which does seem to be the next big step.Clearly, the ECB decided two months ago that they finally had to take the kid gloves off. Maybe their view of economic activity really is that dire. Maybe as they look across the channel at the English success with QE or across the ponds at how the Japanese experiments are going they have begun to wonder, Why not?Whatever the motivation, the first series of steps taken last month wont amount to much unless Super Mario brow beats the non-believers. Markets are a skeptical lot, and given that their skepticism of European new-age financing remains, those views will be reinforced further if no additional actions are taken.The charts currently reinforce that fact. When Draghi indicated that action would be taken at the May meeting, the German DAX /quotes/zigman/26421281/delayed DE:FDXU4 -0.12%  began to immediately discount what was coming. In doing so, it priced in the previously used LTRO and the potential for negative interest rates for parking money with the ECB as seen here in the chart.Initially the rumor was bought, and since the announcement, it has been sold, and it will continue to be sold unless forced to do otherwise. That is Draghis dilemma. The equity chart can still go either way, although it is in the midst of attempting to regenerate higher off the first test of the prior swing-point high.The ultimate test, however, will be in the currency market. On Monday, the euro rose back over the spike high that printed on the June 5 announcement. Here, just two days prior to another announcement and press conference, buyers are willing to pay more for the euro than they did on the day that Super Mario beat his chest and told the world he was ready to move. That doesnt seem like a victory for the ECB does it?Like all central bankers anymore, the debasement of ones currency is the ultimate objective in this quantitative-easing nonsense, and so far, the euro isnt exactly plunging. As the Bank of Japan has shown, if you want to debase, then you must go all the way. Its like Texas Hold em where most of the world is already all in, and the ECB is on the ropes. To change expectations, the ECB has to go all in and then some.Although its hard to imagine the ECB doubling down again and again, if you look closely at the charts above, both do suggest that short-term, something is going to drive the euro lower and equities higher since both are retesting and likely to regenerate in their respective directions.So what will the catalyst be? What will force the euro lower again? The largest and most obvious catalyst is the scheduled ECB meeting this Thursday and, secondarily, the U.S. employment situation. Either or both could create the next catalyst for a continuation move. Added to this is the fact that the U.S. markets close down for a holiday weekend. Thin markets and a long weekend could exacerbate reallocations if traders find themselves on the wrong side of the trade. Given the neoclassical technical setup, Thursday is certainly shaping up to be a very interesting day.Disclosure: Little is long EWG and short FXE.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=D4829D31-FD37-4323-A2FB-A5517CBD440C&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01
BNP Paribas says has ample cash to cover U.S. penalties	By Noemie BisserbeBNP Paribas /quotes/zigman/132292/delayed FR:BNP -2.05%  Chief Financial Officer Lars Machenil said France’s largest listed bank by assets was “in no rush” to boost its capital cushion, even after agreeing to pay the record penalties as part of a U.S. sanctions case.The bank has said the penalties would shave just a little more than a half a percentage point from its core tier-one capital ratio, less than the full percentage point most analysts had anticipated. The ratio is a key gauge of a bank’s financial health.BNP said its ratio would slip to about 10% as of June 30, leaving it on a par with the bulk of its European peers. French rival Société Générale SA has a tier-one ratio of 10.1%.The bank said it hoped to build up its financial fire-power through likely strong second-quarter earnings.On Monday, BNP Paribas offered other good news to stockholders, saying it intended to pay a dividend of EUR1.5 ($2.05) a share on 2014 earnings, similar to the payout for last year. “This sends a confident message on earnings,” said Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets in a research note. RBC had assumed BNP Paribas wouldn’t pay a dividend on this year’s earnings.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:11 ways to support U.S. soccer team vs. BelgiumRetirement reality: Your principal can’t last foreverWhat stock market’s first half tells us about second half	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=D64BE1FC-014A-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01
Time to take stock of your money and investing success	By Jonathan Burton, MarketWatchWhy do investors make wasteful, bone-headed mistakes with good, hard-earned money? Often it’s because we don’t apply lessons and experiences from daily life to our money life. We follow our gut, or worse, don’t follow it. We fail to have realistic expectations, and are surprised when those expectations aren’t met.You hear a lot about how the halfway point of the year is an opportune time to review your investment portfolio, especially with both the S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.55%  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.54%  at record highs. You can rebalance among stocks and bonds, see which stocks have done well so far and figure out what might be worth buying or selling.What you don’t hear as much is that there’s no time like the present to pinpoint emotions that trigger inappropriate investing behavior.Sound money habits are not a birthright. Investors learn to manage expectations better and be realistic about the risk they can handle and the return they need. The best investors stay invested, but not blindly. They make decisions, but not hastily.“What you need,” Warren Buffett counsels, “is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble.”But to build that foundation, we first have to recognize and overcome behavioral biases that trip us up. Three big stumbling blocks are envy, greed and overconfidence.People are prone to envy others, especially those closest to them, who bought stocks, homes, fine art and such earlier and cheaper. Frequently the response is to try for our own big score — even if it means taking more risk than is comfortable.Check out the cycle of investor emotions, above. As the stock market moves higher, investor sentiment sails through optimism and into excitement and thrill. That’s when envy takes hold. But when envy is your date, you are late to the party and stay longer than you should.How do we undercut envy so it doesn’t undermine our investment plans?Don’t compare.Everyone has their own investment needs and goals and ways to achieve them. Your best friend bought Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +0.59%  at $50 a share but you didn’t? Recognize you weren’t willing to take the company-specific risk.

Gold futures at highest close in 11 weeks	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Gold futures settled higher on Tuesday, with prices marking their highest close in about 11 weeks as turmoil in Ukraine and the Middle East lifted safe-haven demand for the metal.

August gold /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.05% tacked on $4.60, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,326.60 an ounce on Comex.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8D2BFFB0-A033-4D80-B8ED-A234CAB5962F&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01

New TSA fees to make airfare more expensive starting this month	By Catey Hill, MarketWatchStarting on July 21, the Transportation Security Administration — you know, the folks who are in charge of confiscating your shampoo at the airport and taking you aside for an “additional screening” — will more than double the mandatory fee they charge many passengers and will no longer cap these fees. Under the old law, the fee, which is used for security, was $2.50 for each leg of a flight with a $5 cap on each one-way trip or a $10 cap on each round trip. But beginning July 21, the fee is $5.60 for each leg of a flight and that is not capped; if your layover is more than four hours on a domestic flight or 12 hours for international destinations, that counts as a second leg of the flight and you will be charged an additional fee.While that may not sound like a lot, consider what this could mean for your wallet. If you book a domestic round trip and have two total connections (and the layover is four hours or more during each connection), you’ll end up shelling out nearly $25 to the TSA. That jacks up the average domestic airline ticket price by more than 5%.This move will hurt all travelers — as the fees are mandatory and built into ticket prices — and it could especially hurt business travelers, says George Hobica, founder of AirfareWatchdog.com. That’s because business travelers often take multicity round trips — a round trip simply means any trip where the traveler leaves and returns from the same spot, so a traveler could stop in a city for a day or two, as many do — and will now have to pay a fee (and now there’s no cap on those fees) on each leg. The TSA uses the examples of a traveler who takes a round trip flight to and from Newark with stops in Chicago, Denver and Las Vegas and pays $28 in fees; before, that would have only been $10. It could also particularly impact those who live in small towns and have to take connecting flights, says Victoria Day, a spokeswoman for Airlines for America, a trade group that represents many large airlines; for the same reason, budget travelers who get superlow fares in exchange for taking flights with connections might also be especially impacted.The higher fees — which will generate an estimated extra $16.9 billion over the next 10 years, according to the government — are slated to help pay for flyer security, and it’s hard to argue against that notion; and the TSA notes that the current fees have never fully covered its costs. There is still a chance that the fee change will be overturned if Congress acts, says Hobica. Plus, even though these fees have increased significantly, they are still a small part of travelers’ overall airline ticket bill.Still, these fees are likely to anger consumers, as they come amid rising ticket prices and fees and as flying becomes more unpleasant. Since 2010, average domestic airfare, adjusted for inflation, has climbed more than 6% to nearly $382 . Plus, airlines have been upping and adding ancillary fees left and right: Just this year, Frontier began making passengers pay to put their bags in the overhead bin and Spirit raised their baggage fees. And this all comes at a time when airline seats are getting thinner and less padded so that airlines can save on fuel.Though there isn’t much you can do about these fees other than write your congressman to complain, says Hobica — MarketWatch has a few suggestions.More stories by Catey Hill:10 insane things people tried to smuggle through airport securityCruise lines with the best — and worst — tipping policies‘Obli-cation’ trips are making you broke	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=AC21F0CE-FE2F-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01

GM, Chrysler, Toyota June car sales climb	By Michael CaliaAfter a torrid May--which included five weekends compared with June’s four--analysts expected sales for the industry to cool off last month. The month had two fewer selling days than the same period a year earlier. But early reports were encouraging and again showed consumers continue to buy despite the year’s big safety recalls.Total results weren’t yet available on Tuesday but GM /quotes/zigman/1466682/delayed/quotes/nls/gm GM 0.00%  and Fiat Chrysler /quotes/zigman/213459/delayed IT:F -1.17%   projected an annualize pace of at least 16.6 million cars and light trucks for the month. May’s seasonally adjusted rate was 16.77 million vehicles, according to market researcher Autodata Corp.GM -- which has recalled about 29 million cars and trucks in North America this year--said it sold 267,461 total vehicles in June, up 1% from a year earlier. Auto researcher Kelley Blue Book had expected GM sales to slip 3.7%.The nation’s largest auto maker posted its best June sales in seven years, with its Buick and GMC brands delivering double-digit sales increases. Retail sales grew 1%, while fleet sales increased 2%. The company had said last month that its May fleet sales would likely represent its highest monthly volume for the year.“June was the third very strong month in a row for GM, with every brand up on a selling-day adjusted basis,” Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president of sales operations, said in a statement. “In fact, the first half of the year was our best retail sales performance since 2008, driven by an outstanding second quarter.”Ford Motor Co.’s /quotes/zigman/264304/delayed/quotes/nls/f F +0.58%   U.S. vehicle sales fell 6% to 221,396 with its car sales off 1.4% compared with a year earlier as a surge in the company’s Focus and Fusion models wasn’t enough to offset declines in its Fiesta and Taurus models. Sales of its F-150 pickup truck topped 50,000 units last month, but were down 11% from a year earlier. Sales of its Lincoln luxury brand fell 3% compared with a year ago.Chrysler--which expanded an ignition-switch recall this week--was among the largest percentage gainers with sales boosted by strong demand for its new Cherokee sport-utility vehicle and Ram pickups. It sold 171,086 total vehicles in June, up 9% from the same month a year ago.Truck and SUV sales, which made up 77% of total Chrysler sales in the month, improved 22%, while car sales fell 19%, hurt by double-digit declines in its Chrysler 200 and 300 sedans.Chrysler brand sales were off 12 percent overall. Sales of the Jeep brand jumped 28%, on the new Cherokee. The Ram brand posted a 14% increase, driven by the brand’s pickup and its new ProMaster van.Toyota Motor Corp. /quotes/zigman/199376/delayed/quotes/nls/tm TM -0.12%   said its U.S. sales rose 3% to 201,714 vehicles last month, topping expectations. The company cited double-digit gains in its recently redesigned Corolla and Camry car models.“Sales in the first half of 2014 indicate a steadily recovering industry, and we expect this pace to increase as we move into the second part of the year,” said Bill Fay, Toyota division group vice president and general manager.Nissan Motor Co. /quotes/zigman/202910/delayed/quotes/nls/nsany NSANY -0.54%  said it sold 109,643 total vehicles in the U.S. last month, aided by shape increases in sales of its Versa and Sentra small cars. Its midsize Altima fell 3% compared with a year earlier.The figure marked a 5% year-over-year increase for the company.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A11B1BD2-0141-11E4-B2B1-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01

BNP pops higher in Europe; pound rises to 2008 levels	By Carla Mozee, MarketWatchOpening the second half of the year, the Stoxx Europe 600 index /quotes/zigman/2380150/delayed XX:SXXP -0.28%  rose 0.9% to end at 344.89. It was the strongest percentage gain since a 1.2% rise on April 29, according to FactSet data.BNP /quotes/zigman/132292/delayed FR:BNP -2.05% was a standout, advancing 3.6% after the bank pleaded guilty to two felony counts on Monday. The plea was part of an $8.8 billion deal to settle an investigation into alleged violations of U.S. sanctions against Sudan and other countries. The bank is also banned for a year from conducting certain U.S. dollar transactions.BNP shares should “catch up, following the significant underperformance over the past four months,” in part as the bank will be able to absorb the negative impact from the fine, said J.P. Morgan Cazenove analysts in a note Tuesday. BNP shares ended the first half of the year down 10%.BNP Paribas Chief Financial Officer Lars Machenil said the bank was in “no rush” to boost its capital cushion, but will consider opportunities to raise cash.The gain for BNP shares aided in a 0.9% rise for France’s CAC 40 equity index /quotes/zigman/3173214/delayed FR:PX1 -0.47% to 4,461.12.Meanwhile, shares of Banco Monte dei Paschi /quotes/zigman/33313188/delayed IT:BMPS -2.53%   jumped 8.6%. An offering of rights to purchase new shares has been closed early because they sold out on the first day, Dow Jones Newswires reported Tuesday. The bank on Friday completed a cash call of 4.99 billion euros ($6.83 billion) and funds were being used to repay a portion of a government loan.“We firmly believe that the capital increase is the turning point for the Italian bank,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, in a Tuesday report.Saxo said financials still dominate its European conviction buy list despite sharp declines last week of nearly 5% on an equal-weighted basis.European equities remained higher after a report showed slowing in the euro-zone’s manufacturing sector in June. Data firm Markit said its purchasing manufacturers’ index was 51.8, lower than a preliminary reading of 51.9.But Markit’s June manufacturing PMI reading for the U.K. came in at 57.5, outpacing expectations for a 57.0 reading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 stock index /quotes/zigman/3173262/delayed UK:UKX +0.01%  jumped 0.9% to 6,802.92, and the British pound /quotes/zigman/4867886/realtime/sampled GBPUSD +0.0221%  rose to $1.715 from $1.708 late Monday, trading at levels last seen in October 2008.“With U.K. data continuing to exceed expectations the pressure builds on [Bank of England] to hike rates this year rather than in 2015,” wrote BK Asset Management’s managing director of FX strategy Boris Schlossberg. The benchmark interest rate currently stands a record low level of 0.5%.Separately, unemployment in Germany in June rose a seasonally adjusted 9,000 to 2.92 million. The adjusted jobless rate held at 6.7%.The jobs report together with weak German retail sales results from Monday indicates the euro-zone’s largest economy is starting to slow down, “although the slack is picked up somewhat by the periphery, especially Spain, where the rebound continues to gather pace,” Schlossberg wrote.In Frankfurt, the DAX 30 /quotes/zigman/2380246/delayed DX:DAX -0.20%  ended up 0.7% at 9,902.41.Investors will watch what the European Central Bank will say about economic growth and monetary policy on Thursday.Back to stocks, shares of Ocado Group PLC /quotes/zigman/604355/delayed UK:OCDO -5.43%  dropped 4.4%. The British online grocer swung to a pretax profit on a 16% rise in sales during the first half of the year, but also noted the rate of growth in the online grocery market is “currently impacted by subdued and cautious consumer spending.”Mining stocks were among advancers after two separate reports on manufacturing in China — a key buyer of natural resources — suggested a rebound. Anglo American PLC /quotes/zigman/470624/delayed UK:AAL -0.26%  sprung 4% higher, diversified miner BHP Billiton /quotes/zigman/184879/delayed UK:BLT +0.55%   /quotes/zigman/270355/delayed/quotes/nls/bhp BHP +1.28%  moved up 2.9%, and Rio Tinto PLC /quotes/zigman/155899/delayed UK:RIO -0.32%  advanced 3%.China factories show first improvement in six monthsWhat could make stocks tumble?

U.S. manufacturing stays strong in June	By Jeffry Bartash, MarketWatchThe Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index registered 55.3% in June, just a hair below May’s reading of 55.4%. Any number above 50% signals expansion. Read ISM report.The resurgence among American manufacturers suggests the plunge in first-quarter U.S. growth was an aberration that’s quickly faded away. The 2.9% drop in gross domestic product was the biggest outside of a recession since 1947, but economists polled by MarketWatch predict growth will rebound to around 3% in the second quarter.The ISM index is compiled from a survey of executives who order raw materials and other supplies for their companies. The gauge tends to rise or fall in tandem with the health of the economy.The index has registered 50% or higher in every month except for one since the Great Recession ended in mid-2009,marking the best stretch of growth since the 1960s, noted Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG. The manufacturing sector does not play as big a role in the U.S. economy, however, or employ nearly as many people as it once did.In U.S. markets on Thursday, stocks extended a rally after the positive ISM report.The ISM’s new-orders gauge jumped 2 percentage points to 58.9%, the highest level since December. Executives in virtually every key U.S. manufacturing sector said business was “strong” or “picking up.”“Another strong month overall,” said an executive at a computer maker.The production index, meanwhile, fell to 60% from 61%. Yet the index has been at 60% or above in eight of the past 12 months, the fastest period of growth in three years.The employment gauge was flat at 52.8%.Fifteen of the 18 U.S. manufacturing industries surveyed by ISM reported growth in April. Three said business contracted.“‘We’re on a very positive trend despite the tiny decline in the rate of growth,” said Bradley Holcomb, who’s in charge of the ISM manufacturing survey committee.”Separately, the privately run research firm Markit said its final reading of U.S. manufacturing conditions in June totaled 57.3, compared with a preliminary reading of 57.5. That’s still the highest reading since May 2010.Also, a global manufacturing survey rose to a four-month high and a similar index in the U.K. showed surprising strength in June.

ISM index dips to 55.3% in June, but new orders jump	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - U.S. manufacturing companies expanded at a slightly slower but still rapid pace in June, as new orders rose to the highest level since the end of 2013, a survey of executives found. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index dipped to 55.3% last month from 55.4% in May. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected the index to rise to 55.7%. Readings over 50% indicate more companies are expanding instead of shrinking. The ISMs new-orders index climbed 2 points to 58.9% from 56.9%; production slipped to 60% from 61%. The employment gauge was unchanged at 52.8%. Fifteen of the industries tracked by ISM reported growth last month while three recorded a decline.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A3183439-5D58-488C-8C09-5F4E080504AD&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01

Twitter names Goldman banker Noto as CFO	By Anna PriorThe management shifts, unveiled in a regulatory filing Tuesday, come less than a month after Twitter said Chief Operating Officer Ali Rowghani had stepped down from his role.Widely seen as the architect of Twitter’s initial public offering, Gupta for four months steered the social-media company through the IPO process while trying to avoid the missteps that tripped up rival Facebook Inc.’s offering in 2012.Along the way, Gupta helped keep confidential for two months the company’s IPO filing, kept the company out of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s cross hairs, and helped secure a $1 billion low-interest loan. The payoff: Twitter’s /quotes/zigman/23556538/delayed/quotes/nls/twtr TWTR -1.05%   offering last year launched without incident and the San Francisco-based company raised as much as $2.1 billion and ended its first day of trading with a market capitalization of about $25 billion.Meanwhile, Noto, who is 46 years old, served as a managing director in the technology, media and telecom investment banking group at Goldman Sachs & Co. from October 2010 until June.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Some startling news for investors, Yellen and CongressHow to fly on a private jet for under $200 per personOne trick to make flying better and cheaper	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F2A9C8E8-0125-11E4-8470-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01

Dollar posts quarterly losses vs. pound, yen	By Joseph Adinolfi and Saumya Vaishampayan, MarketWatchThe ICE dollar index /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY +0.07% , which pits the greenback against six other currencies, fell to 79.784 from 80.0410. For the quarter, the index is down 0.4%. The WSJ Dollar Index /quotes/zigman/9625991/realtime XX:BUXX +0.03% , a rival measure of the dollar’s strength, was at 72.60 versus 72.74.The big question for the dollar was when the Federal Reserve could begin to lift interest rates. Higher interest rates would likely boost the U.S. currency, as foreign investors buy it to obtain higher-yielding dollar-denominated assets.But the dollar’s poor performance in the second quarter defied analysts’ expectations. Steven Englander, global head of G-10 foreign-exchange strategy at Citi, cited low volatility that drove investors to seek higher yields elsewhere by buying both G-10 and emerging-market currencies.U.S. data also confused some traders, who weren’t sure what to make of seemingly contradictory evidence regarding economic growth.“The market appears to be torn between the surprisingly weak U.S. economic data in Q1 of this year and the seemingly stronger evidence of growth in the most recent economic reports,” said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign-exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, in a note.“If this week’s data could surprise to the upside, it could tilt the sentiment towards the buck,” he added.On Monday, the Chicago purchasing managers index for June fell to 62.6 from 65.5 in May, below expectations for a reading of 64.3. Separately, a measure of pending-home sales rose 6.1% in May to an eight-month high.The euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/realtime/sampled EURUSD -0.1091%  rose to $1.3695 from $1.3630 late Friday. For the quarter, the euro has shed 0.6% against the dollar. Data released Monday showed the annual rate of inflation in the euro zone was steady at 0.5%, marking the ninth month in a row of sub-1% inflation. The European Central Bank is scheduled to meet Thursday, but market participants aren’t expecting further action after it cut interest rates in June and unveiled a number of measures aimed at boosting liquidity.The New Zealand dollar /quotes/zigman/4867888/realtime/sampled NZDUSD -0.1496%  fell to 87.59 U.S. cents from 87.78 U.S. cents late Friday.

Lew says Chinas currency is undervalued	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew on Tuesday said that Chinas currency remains undervalued. U.S. and Chinese officials will discuss economic issues at an annual Strategic and Economic dialogue meeting in Beijing next week. In a preview of the talks at the U.S.-China Business Council, Lew said progress on bilateral issues had been mixed over the past year. He said China seemed to follow a path of two steps forward and part of a step back on the exchange rate. Although the yuan has appreciated by 14% since 2010, it still needs to appreciate more, it is undervalued, Lew said. There are concerns that China is holding down the value of its currency to give it an advantage over U.S. exporters. Lew said there was pretty clear evidence that China was intervening to weaken the yuan. He called for China to be more transparent about its exchange rate policy.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CDFC3491-5CDC-4E97-B427-703158BE438C&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01

How to fly on a private jet for under $200 per person	By Catey Hill, MarketWatchA handful of sites and private jet companies are following the lead of hotels and hotel websites and offering last-minute deals on unused inventory, and others are changing the cost structure of private plane travel to make it vastly more affordable.JetSuite.com , which flies to more than 2,000 airports, aggregates private jet flights with empty seats to offer daily “next-day” deals. Some of its recent deals included a flight for four people from Los Angeles to Cabo San Lucas for $499 (that’s about $124 per person, which includes federal excise taxes and fees); for four people from Orange County to Chicago for $536 (that’s about $135 per person); and for six people from Teterboro (in New Jersey, near New York City) to Nassau, Bahamas for $1,074 (that’s about $179 per person). (In all of the above cases, to get the per person rate, you must book all seats on the plane.) It’s not the only one offering these kinds of rates: Consumers may also get big last-minute deals, even when they aren’t advertised, by calling a private aviation company within a few days from when they want to depart and asking whether they have deals going on.Waiting until the last minute isn’t an option for most travelers, of course. For those whose schedules can’t accommodate a last-minute booking, there are other options, though they can be pricier. West Coast airline Surf Air offers unlimited private plane flights to and from certain California locales like Los Angeles and Santa Barbara for $1,599 per month (plus a one-time $500 initiation fee), which includes all fees; if you take four or more flights on the airline, those tickets could amount to less than the cost of similar coach or business class seats. The airline expanded to Truckee, Calif. (close to Lake Tahoe) just last month and says it will get its multi-state license so it can cross state lines later this year.And FLITE Air Taxi offers a la carte private plane flights for reasonable rates: A flight from Boston to Saratoga, N.Y. costs $541 per person (you will need six people to fill the plane, so $3,250 for the whole flight), as does one from New York City to Martha’s Vineyard and from Block Island to Worcester, Mass.; this does not include federal excise taxes (7.5% of the cost of the flight) but does include other fees.How can these and other similar companies afford to offer such low rates? One reason is that sites like JetSuite.com are offering seats on flights that would have been empty or at least not full. “Over 40% of flights that are flying private have empty seats,” says Steve King, the co-founder of private jet charter company AeroIQ . Many times, these flights are simply repositioning so they can pick up passengers in another city and the companies would rather get some money from passengers than no money.Companies like Surf Air and FLITE Air Taxi can charge less than big-name competitors, in part, because they use different planes — like, for example, single-prop turbo planes — that cost less to operate because they use less fuel than larger jets. “The operational cost can be a fraction of other planes,” says Justin Hart, vice president of Surf Air memberships.To be sure, there are some significant additional caveats to discount private plane travel. Often these deals are only for one-way flights, so they will then need to find an alternative way back. It’s also important to understand that there may be extra fees added to the cost of your flight — such as airport or landing fees — so read the contract to determine what’s included and what’s not. De-icing fees, for example, can be significant and may be passed on to consumers, says Jeff Trance, the SVP of private jets for the U.S. for jet charter company Air Partner .And typically, you can’t just buy one discount ticket on these planes; they’ll want you to pay for the whole cost of the plane, so you’ll need to find a group to go with you to get the most savings. Plus, if you want to save big, you likely won’t get a brand-new primo jet, as these tend to cost more. And finally, there’s the issue of safety: Private chartered planes tend to get in more crashes than commercial jets — though they are still far safer than cars . Most small-plane accidents were due to pilot error, so call the private jet company to determine how many hours of flying experience your pilot has.Despite these downsides, the allure of private plane travel is strong thanks to how uncomfortable both the airport and flying experience have become. Here are some ways to save.Be flexibleIf you’re flexible both on when you fly and where you fly, you’ll likely get the best deals, says Trance. Call the company and ask about the cost differences between, say, a Saturday and a Tuesday and see if you can fly into a nearby airport. Fridays and Sundays tend to be the most expensive times to travel, says Justin Sullivan, the co-founder of FLITE Air Taxi. And, of course, last-minute deals can be significant so it may be worth waiting until about 72 hours before you want to fly to find deals, says Trance, though this is, of course, risky.Know where the most likely deals areThe Northeast markets, California and the Northeast-to-Florida routes tend to have the most last-minute deals on them, says Bob Diener, co-founder of Hotels.com and Getaroom.com.Shop aroundDiener recommends checking out FlyVictor.com, as it compares the cost of private jet travel across different airlines. He says that JetSuite.com is the best known for last-minute deals. You may also want to consider having a broker do the heavy lifting for you, says Trance; brokers typically work on commission, so ask them what their commission is before booking and how you pay it, and tell them your all-in price tolerance ahead of time.Go with a small group — but not too smallTrance says that if you travel with a group of seven or fewer you can often save significantly because you can opt for a smaller — and often less-expensive-to-operate — plane. You likely don’t want a party of two because most private aviation companies require you to rent out the entire private plane (typically four seats or more).Also see:10 things that rich people know and you don’tOne trick to make your next flight better — and cheaper10 insane things people tried to smuggle through airport security‘Obli-cation’ trips are making you broke	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=DEE0D5DC-011A-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01
Economy this year will be no better than last year	By Irwin Kellner, MarketWatchHalf past 2014 finds economists scrambling to lower their forecasts for this year.Most forecasters had expected that this year would start out on a weak note because of the severe winter that hit a wide swath of the country.However they never dreamed that the economy would go backward, and certainly not by an annual rate of nearly 3%. This was the biggest decline in five years, when the economy was laboring to climb out of the Great Recession.Obviously, the unusually harsh winter was a big factor in the drop. This could not have been anticipated by the pundits.Another thing that threw them off was the continued gains in confidence throughout the first quarter, accompanied by generally healthy growth in employment. For these reasons, many forecasters are doggedly sticking to their expectations of a sharp rebound in the second quarter — not to mention over the balance of the year.It’s as though the cold winter was the only reason for the decline. There clearly were other factors, which I’ll get to in a moment.First let me acknowledge that some of the activity that did not take place during the first quarter can — and probably did — take place in the second. I am referring to construction of residential and commercial buildings, repair work on roads and bridges, and sales of such big-ticket items as homes and motor vehicles.That said, other things don’t lend themselves to make-up. These would be such items as trips not taken, shows and expos not attended, and even gasoline not bought.As I observed in a recent column, the second quarter has not gotten off to a flying start. The sharp rebound that many were expecting has yet to materialize.The biggest chunk of the economy — consumer spending — remains weak. There was only a slight increase in May following no change in April. Higher gas and oil prices, combined with the rising cost of food, are doing a number on consumers’ buying power.On the policy front, monetary policy has gone about as far as it can go. Interest rates are at rock bottom, while there is loads of liquidity sloshing around in the financial markets. For its part, fiscal policy is frozen, thanks to political animosities emanating from both sides of the aisle and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.These are just a few of the negatives that are holding back growth. For these reasons I am not looking for much of a rebound, certainly not until much later this year or early next.Don’t be misled by the monthly numbers. As we saw in the first quarter, they don’t always translate directly into GDP terms. This is especially true for services spending, business inventories and foreign trade.All this aside, the economy would have to grow well in excess of 4% over the remainder of the year to pull the average for the year as a whole significantly above 2%. Even so, this would be no better than last year and well below 2012’s 2.8%, which was itself no big deal.More must-reads From MarketWatch:What could make stocks tumble?

It’s not too late to buy this 41% stock gainer	By Philip van Doorn, MarketWatchManitowoc Inc. /quotes/zigman/232936/delayed/quotes/nls/mtw MTW +0.24%  is a prime example. The Manitowoc, Wis.-based company was founded in 1902 and operates in two unrelated segments: cranes and food-service equipment.The company has increased its annual sales per share for the past three years. The food-service-equipment unit makes a far larger contribution to operating earnings than cranes, even though it provides considerably less revenue:As you can see above, Manitowoc enjoyed solid revenue gains in both divisions last year, along with a decline in restructuring expenses. Earnings rose to $141.8 million, or $1.05 a share, from $101.7 million, or 76 cents, in 2012.The food-service segment had a gross operating profit margin of 16%, almost double the cranes unit’s 9%. The food-service margin was unchanged from the previous year, while the cranes margin improved from 7%.The stock: Shares of Manitowoc have returned 41% this year through Friday’s close at $32.86. The stock has returned 544% over the past five years, which far outpaces a return of 137% for the S&P 500 Index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.55% . The shares trade for 16.1 times the consensus 2015 earnings estimate of $2.04, among analysts polled by FactSet. That’s up 24% from this year’s forecast.The stock rose 11% Friday after Relational Investors LLC disclosed that funds it manages had built up an 8.5% stake. The San Diego-based activist investor said in a filing that Manitowoc’s two businesses “differ materially in their operating metrics and cyclical characteristics, which we’re convinced causes a perpetual discount in the share price.”Relational Investors went on to say that spinning off the food-service business from cranes to create two separate publicly traded companies “would maximize shareholder value.” The investors have met with the company’s senior management, but said Manitowoc’s Board of Directors has refused a meeting.Manitowoc CEO Glen Tellock said in a press release that the company would continue to “consider and review Relational Investors’ suggestions” as part of its “regular evaluation” of “strategic imperatives” to maximize shareholder value. The company also said Goldman, Sachs & Co. /quotes/zigman/188479/delayed/quotes/nls/gs GS +1.54%   was serving as its adviser.Manitowoc declined to comment for this article.Bull case: Based on Friday’s market reaction, investors clearly see a path to big gains from a spinoff. Credit Suisse analyst Jamie Cook, in a note to clients Monday, said Manitowoc has an opportunity “to improve margins to high teens/low-20% range on internal initiatives” in the food-service segment.Through investment and acquisitions, the unit “has become a ‘one-stop’ shop with a broader breadth of products (hot, cold and ice/beverage),” Cook wrote.But rather than predicting a simple spinoff into two companies, Cook believes Manitowoc’s best option for the cranes unit would be a sale to a “larger industrial” company, perhaps one of several Asian companies looking to enter the U.S. market.Cook reiterated his “outperform” rating for Manitowoc and raised his price target for the shares to $39 from $34. The higher valuation is based on a multiple of 8.5 times his 2016 earnings estimate for the cranes business and a 12.5 multiple for food service.Bear case: Manitowoc may not to split itself up. The company could argue that the different economic and sales cycles for its separate business lines gives it a long-term advantage.Such a decision could prompt a more aggressive play by Relational Investors to gain more influence over the company by taking a larger stake, fighting a proxy battle to take control over Manitowoc’s Board of Directors, and other nasty, public actions.Regardless of what happens, the long-term trend of Manitowoc is good. Margins for both businesses are expected to improve, and we’re right in the middle of a positive sales cycle for the cranes unit, according to Cook.But if Manitowoc makes a clear decision not to make a strategic move, and it wins that battle, the shares could plummet — remember, they’re up 41% this year — setting up an excellent opportunity for investors to scoop up shares of a company with improving profits.More from MarketWatch:10 biggest S&P winners, losers of 2014Halliburton shares soar 40%; more on tap?J.P.

Why tax planning is so important	By Bill BischoffWhat tax planning really meansTax planning is the art of arranging your affairs in ways that postpone or avoid taxes. By employing effective tax planning strategies, you can have more money to save and invest or more money to spend. Or both. Your choice.Put another way, tax planning means deferring and flat out avoiding taxes by taking advantage of beneficial tax-law provisions, increasing and accelerating tax deductions and tax credits, and generally making maximum use of all applicable breaks available under our beloved Internal Revenue Code.Also read: You may owe the IRS $10,000While the federal income tax rules are now more complicated than ever, the benefits of good tax planning are arguably more valuable than ever before.Of course, you should not change your financial behavior solely to avoid taxes. Truly effective tax planning strategies are those that permit you to do what you want while reducing tax bills along the way.How are tax planning and financial planning connected?Financial planning is the art of implementing strategies that help you reach your financial goals, be they short-term or long-term. That sounds pretty simple. However, if the actual execution was simple, there would be a lot more rich folks.Tax planning and financial planning are closely linked, because taxes are such a large expense item as you go through life. If you become really successful, taxes will probably be your single biggest expense over the long haul. So planning to reduce taxes is a critically important piece of the overall financial planning process.Horror stories when folks fail to make the connectionOver the years as a tax pro, I have been amazed at how many people fail to get the message about tax planning until they commit a grievous blunder that costs them a bundle in otherwise avoidable taxes. Then they finally get it. The trick is to make sure you don’t have to learn this lesson the hard way. To illustrate the point, consider the following example.Example: Josephine is a 45-year-old unmarried professional person. She considers herself to be financially astute. However, she is not well-versed on taxes. One day, Josephine meets Joe, and they quickly decide to get married. Caught up in the excitement of a whole new life, Josephine impulsively sells her home shortly before the marriage. The property is in a great area and has appreciated by $500,000 since she bought it 15 years ago. She intends to move into Joe’s home, which is a dump, but Josephine is a proven genius at remodeling, and she plans to work her usual magic on Joe’s property.Result without tax planning: For federal income tax purposes, Josephine has a whopping $250,000 gain on the sale of her home ($500,000 profit minus the $250,000 home sale gain exclusion allowed to unmarried sellers).Result with tax planning: If Josephine had instead kept her home and lived there with Joe for two years before selling, she could have taken advantage of the larger $500,000 home sale gain exclusion available to married joint-filers and thereby permanently avoided $250,000 of taxable gain. If necessary, Joe’s home could have been sold instead of Josephine’s. Alternatively, Joe’s property could have been retained, and the couple could have worked on remodeling it while still living in Josephine’s home for the requisite two years.Moral of the story? By selling her home without considering the tax-smart alternative, Josephine cost herself $62,500 in taxes (completely avoidable $250,000 gain taxed at an assumed combined federal and state rate of 25%). This is a permanent difference, not just a timing difference. The point is, you cannot ignore taxes. If you do, bad things can happen, even with a seemingly intelligent transaction.The last wordThere are many other ways to commit expensive tax blunders. Like selling appreciated securities too soon when hanging on for just a little longer would have resulted in lower-taxed long-term capital gains instead of higher-taxed short-term gains; taking retirement account withdrawals before age 59½ and getting hit with the 10% premature withdrawal penalty tax; or failing to arrange for payments to an ex-spouse to qualify as deductible alimony; the list goes on and on.The cure is to plan transactions with taxes in mind and avoid making impulsive moves. Seeking professional tax advice before pulling the trigger on significant transactions is usually money well spent. As we get closer to the end of the year, some of my columns will focus on tax planning strategies that many folks can benefit from.

One trick to make your next flight better — and cheaper	By Brett Arends, MarketWatchTake off your shoes. Take off your belt. Stand in line forever. Fight to get on the plane. Fight to get off. Pay to check your bags. Or join all the other schmucks trying to save money by carrying all their bags into the cabin, and shove them into the overhead locker.Oh, you forgot: There’s a container in your suitcase with more than three ounces of liquid. Okay, everybody stop everything while this nerd unzips his bag and tries to find it.If you’re flying away this holiday weekend, you’re going to be reminded, yet again, of how horrible the experience has become.Prices are going up. The airlines are slashing the value of their frequent-flier miles. And they’re charging more and more for the simple privilege of checking your bags — which is why everyone is now wheeling full-sized suitcases into the cabins and trying to shove them into the overhead locker. “Oh, I’m sorry, was that your head?”But if you’re going away this summer, here’s a neat trick I came across just by chance that can make the whole experience just so, so much better.No, don’t pay the fees to check your luggage in the hold.And no, don’t drag it through security and into the cabin, either.There’s a third option.Ship it.No, really. Now that airlines are charging so much to check your bags, it may actually be cheaper, as well as a whole lot more convenient, to have UPS /quotes/zigman/251269/delayed/quotes/nls/ups UPS +0.32%  or FedEx /quotes/zigman/254280/delayed/quotes/nls/fdx FDX +0.88%   take them instead. Drop them off — or even get them to pick the luggage up.I came across this quite by chance a short while ago. I’d been down in Florida for a month working on my book. I’d taken my manual typewriter with me — a heavy classic Corona from the 1930s. But after using it heavily for a month it needed a minor adjustment, so I decided to ship it back to a typewriter repair guy near my home.While at FedEx, I reflected that the cost of shipping it by FedEx Ground was about the same as checking it on flight — and much easier. FedEx Ground, the company’s cheapest service, delivers within four days.When I mentioned this to the guy behind the counter, he pointed behind him, where there were a couple of full-sized wheely suitcases wrapped up in shipping plastic. “We get quite a few customers come in here,” he said, “they don’t want the hassle of flying with all their luggage, so they just drop it off and we take it.”First, consider the math.Major carriers have been raising the costs of checking bags. Typically, according to their websites, if you are flying within the U.S. or Canada they’ll charge you $25 to check the first bag, and $35 to check the second. You’ll also pay a fortune for anything that weighs over 50 pounds — typically $100 for 50 to 70 pounds, and $200 for 70 to 100 pounds.As an illustration, FedEx will charge $37 to ship a 25-pound suitcase all the way from New York to Los Angeles, and $65 to ship a 50-pound suitcase. If you are going a shorter distance, it’s less.UPS says it also does good business from travelers who prefer to ship their luggage. It offers sturdy and lightweight “luggage boxes” designed to replace suitcases. “We hear from the franchisees that there is a spike in luggage box usage as we get into the summer travel season,” says spokeswoman Laurie Mallis.“We also specialize in packing odd, oversized items, such as golf clubs and fishing poles — items [people] would prefer to have waiting at their destination rather than lugging them around an airport,” she adds.(And it’s not just about the up-front cost, either. If I’m not dragging my luggage with me, I no longer have to take taxis to and from the airport. I’ll just take the subway.)And there’s the whole hassle thing.I love the idea of saying goodbye to my luggage and not worrying or thinking about it until I arrive at the hotel — when it is either in the storage room or waiting in my room. (“Oh, I sent my luggage on ahead” — how wonderfully Edwardian!)No last-minute packing panic the night before the flight. Get the packing done early, and then forget about it. (You can always pack a few essentials, and any last minute items you forgot, in your carry-on bag).No schlepping bags to or through the airport. Bliss.I hate flying. But if I have to fly, I’m going to do everything I can to make it a little less unbearable.Now, what can we do about all the little old ladies who check in exactly 24 hours before takeoff and take all the aisle seats?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5DFE9DD0-009F-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01

IBM’s China troubles could be getting worse	By Therese Poletti, MarketWatchInvestors are hoping for an update on IBM”s goal of reaching $18 in earnings per share for 2014, and to learn of any encouraging signs for its hardware business. The tech giant is slated to report second-quarter earnings on July 17.But many on Wall Street appear dubious that IBM /quotes/zigman/230066/delayed/quotes/nls/ibm IBM +0.07% will be able to hit its targets. The current Wall Street consensus for earnings in 2014, according to FactSet Research, is $17.88 a share, with revenue of $97.38 billion, down from $99.75 billion in 2013. The average recommendation on the stock is a hold.Adding new pressure to IBM are recent reports from China that suggest its current troubles there may not improve. In the third quarter of 2013, a big drop in sales in China especially hurt IBM’s results. The company cited business execution problems and China’s economic reforms as contributors to the decline.Then in April, IBM said first quarter revenue in China fell 20%.“We’re seeing a slowdown in that procurement process as they implement reforms,” IBM Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter told a J.P. Morgan Technology Conference in May. “We are investing with the idea that China, like the rest of the growth markets, they’re absolutely going to come back and they’re going to be fine.” But, he added, “you can’t predict when that is going to happen.”IBM is also doing more to work with customers in China. In early June it opened a new customer center in Beijing especially designed for mainframe and cloud computing, where customers can go for briefings, technical training, testing and technical support.But news agency Caixin Online in Beijing reported last week that some Chinese companies are starting to pull the plug on expensive mainframe hardware and software made by IBM, Oracle Corp, /quotes/zigman/19452757/delayed/quotes/nls/orcl ORCL +0.95%  and EMC Corp. /quotes/zigman/225273/delayed/quotes/nls/emc EMC +0.82% , in favor of cheaper Chinese developed technology. Huawei Technology Co. /quotes/zigman/2339927/realtime CN:002502 +10.03% , for example, was described as one rival that has been winning contracts from state company and bank information technology departments.In addition, some Chinese Internet companies, like Alibaba, are copying Facebook Inc. /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB -0.24%  and Google Inc. /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%  and developing their own data centers and server racks with off-the-shelf hardware.In the first quarter of this year, IBM saw revenue of its overall hardware business fall 23%, with mainframes hit the hardest. Yet IBM has managed to report strong earnings, helped in part by cost management and stock buybacks.Schroeter will host his second call with Wall Street later in July. There will likely be more questions about China. Compounding IBM’s issues in China now is the company’s pending $2.3 billion sale of its server business to Lenovo Group Ltd. /quotes/zigman/21902/delayed HK:0992 -1.71%  , which the Wall Street Journal reported last week has stalled, as the U.S. government investigates security concerns over the deal.The same issues came up previously in 2005 when Lenovo bought IBM’s PC business, which eventually was given the go-ahead, with some conditions.Investors also will be listening closely for updates from IBM on its sales to China, or whether media reports about IBM’s China business are overblown. Indeed, as Caixin Online itself noted, the switch to servers developed by Chinese companies is a slow process, especially for banks, because some suppliers have yet to meet the necessary security and stability requirements.Cindy Shaw, an analyst at Discern, wrote in a note on Monday that she expects market share losses to erode sales in China for enterprise IT vendors including IBM, EMC and Oracle (the latter two of which she does not cover) and to a lesser extent Hewlett-Packard Co. /quotes/zigman/229301/delayed/quotes/nls/hpq HPQ +0.35% .“Efforts to replace the existing infrastructure should have a very long tail that causes a slow decline in current recurring revenue (e.g., services and software licenses),” she wrote.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9D0F4226-FE48-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01

Retirees may be ignoring their biggest assets	But new research indicates that before doing the math, it’s important to consider something many investors and financial advisers overlook: the value and riskiness of your other assets—specifically, any pension and Social Security benefits you stand to receive, your future employment income and your home equity.For many people, these assets represent half or more of their total wealth, says David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Chicago-based Morningstar Investment Management, which released the research—co-written by Morningstar senior research consultant Philip Straehl —this spring as a resource for individuals and financial planners.Incorporating these assets into a financial plan can result in “huge adjustments in portfolio design,” said Blanchett, whose simulations indicate the average investor should consider increasing the proportion of equities in his or her investment portfolio by 20 percentage points or more.More like bondsThat’s because, for most investors, these assets have more in common with bonds than with stocks. For example, Social Security and pension benefits, along with paychecks issued by stable companies, are predictable sources of income that resemble the interest payments on bonds.And despite the real-estate bubble, home prices historically have appreciated by an average of 2% to 4% a year, providing a relatively steady, bond-like return, Blanchett said.As a result, he says, investors should add most—if not all—of the value of these assets to the bond part of their portfolios. If that makes their overall wealth too heavily concentrated in bonds, they should adjust by selling some bonds and buying more stocks, he says.Running the numbersFor example, for a 65-year-old woman to roughly calculate the value of her future Social Security benefits, she would start with her annual benefit and multiply by 20, Blanchett said. The multiplier—which takes into account mortality estimates and the math required to discount future benefits into today’s dollars—is different for each gender and at every age; for a 55-year-old man, for instance, it’s about 15. (If you aren’t already receiving Social Security benefits, you can estimate what your annual benefit will be on the Social Security website .)So, for a 65-year-old woman who receives $25,000 in annual benefits, the value of those payments as an asset is about $500,000. Next, she would add that $500,000 to the bond portion of her investment portfolio. If she has $1 million of investments—with 65%, or $650,000, in bonds and 35%, or $350,000, in stocks—the inclusion of Social Security raises the total portfolio’s value to $1.5 million and increases the amount in bonds from $650,000 to $1.15 million, or 77% of the total. To get back to a 65/35 mix, this investor would need to reduce her bondholdings to $475,000 from $650,000 and raise her equity holdings to $525,000 from $350,000.To add real estate to the picture, simply add your current home equity to the total you have invested in bonds—in most cases. Those in volatile housing markets, such as Las Vegas or Miami, or areas that depend on the fortunes of a single employer or industry might want to treat as much as half of their home equity as a stock, Blanchett said.To figure the value of future wages, a 55-year-old man would multiply his current salary by about nine; the multipliers for wages assume that the investor will retire upon turning age 65 and that future earnings will increase annually by the inflation rate. Given that few jobs are 100% secure, most people should add 70% of the result to the total of their bondholdings and 30% to their stock allocation, Blanchett said.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9BC700BE-FD5A-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-01

10-year Treasurys notch best first half since 2010	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR 0.00%  yield, which falls as prices rise, was down a basis point at 2.523%, according to Tradeweb.The yield fell 52 basis points during the six months since the end of 2013, the best first half since 2010, and the best two quarters since the period ending in September 2012, according to Ryan ALM. The Barclays U.S. Treasury index rose 2.6% during the year-to-date through Friday, while the U.S. Aggregate index tracking the broad bond market saw a 3.8% rise.The rise in prices and drop in Treasury yields this year has defied the expectations of most investors, who saw rates rising as the economy strengthened. A surprise contraction in GDP during the first quarter due to cold winter weather helped hamper that move. It also buoyed a small subset of investors who projected yields to fall due to demand generated by the relative attractiveness of U.S. markets, dovish central bank policy, and a sluggish economy.Read: Why bond contrarians are beating the vigilantesThat outperformance may be poised to extend into the third quarter of the year as the market quiets down for the summer.“Given the likelihood of a summer lull starting Q3, we recommend earning carry when possible as we wait for guidance from global central banks and risk-events towards quarter end,” said George Goncalves, head of interest-rate strategy at Nomura Securities, in a note.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR 0.00%  yield was down 1 basis point at 3.352%, while the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR 0.00%  yield fell a basis point to 1.628%.Treasury prices swung back and forth as economic data hit the wire, but the push higher in prices was attributed largely to buying at the end of the quarter.“A lot of it was month-end, quarter-end demand. There wasn’t a whole lot more than that. We had some early weakness, which I think was some hangover from last week’s supply,” said John Canavan, bond market analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates.Pending home sales rose to the highest level in eight months, while the Chicago PMI business conditions gauge fell in June after hitting a seven-month high in May.These two debt payments may be heard around the worldJanet Yellen’s Georgetown neighbors complain about security detailJ.P.

Oil futures slip but log monthly, quarterly gains	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchNatural-gas prices, meanwhile, gained to pare back some of their monthly loss as traders watched a storm system developing near Florida for any potential disruptions to Gulf of Mexico energy output.Brent crude took the biggest hit for the session, with the August contract on the ICE Futures exchange /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -0.38%  falling 94 cents, or 0.8%, to $112.36 a barrel. Brent, the global oil benchmark, had topped $115 earlier this month, setting a nine-month high as Sunni insurgents swept across cities in northern Iraq.Brent crude saw gain of around 2.7% for the month, based on the most-active contracts. For the quarter, it ended 4.3% higher.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, August West Texas Intermediate crude /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.28%  fell 37 cents, or 0.4%, to settle at $105.37 a barrel. Also tracking the most-active contracts, WTI crude was up roughly 2.6% for the month, for a 3.7% gain for the quarter.On Nymex, if prices break the $104 support, crude oil may fall below the $100 mark, said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade.Meanwhile, media surveys of June oil production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, are expected to confirm the cartel continued to supply sufficient oil to the market this month and that the fighting in the north of Iraq has so far had no effect on Iraq’s oil output, wrote analysts at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.Crude exports from the southern Iraqi port of Basra run at around 2.5 million barrels a day, equal to around 3% of global production, analysts say.Traders awaited weekly updates on petroleum inventories due out on Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute and on Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration.Price Futures Group expects the data to show a weekly decline of 2 million barrels for crude stockpiles. It’s also looking for a climb of 2 million barrels in gasoline inventories and a gain of 1 million barrels for distillates, which include heating oil.July gasoline closed down 2 cents, or 0.7%, at $3.08 a gallon, while July heating oil  lost almost 3 cents, or 0.9%, to $2.97 a gallon. The July contracts expired at the end of the Nymex trading session. Tracking the most-active contracts, gasoline futures were up 3.5% for the month and up 5.4% for the quarter, while heating oil traded up 2.8% for the month and gained 1.4% for the quarter.August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 -0.89%  settled at $4.46 per million British thermal units, up 5 cents, or 1.2%. “Even with record production, we can’t afford to loose any production,” said Phil Flynn, senior markets analyst at Price Futures Group.Futures prices, tracking the most-active contracts, saw a loss of 1.8% for the month but ended around 2.1% higher for the quarter.Halliburton shares soar 40%, with maybe more on tapNew York Supreme Court says cities and towns can opt to ban fracking10 biggest S&P 500 winners and losers for 2014	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=93F556A8-0050-11E4-B2B1-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

You may want to ignore the ‘next big thing’ in mutual funds	By Chuck Jaffe, MarketWatchBack in the Internet bubble days, HOLDERs — Holding Company Depository Receipts — were “the next big thing.” After the initial buzz, they fizzled out. Then it was “folios,” where investors could basically make do-it-yourself mutual fund portfolios; it was a terrific concept that got almost no traction in the real world.What’s “next” now is a new form of exchange-traded fund that makes it very easy to offer active management built on the framework of an ETF.The only thing stopping a tidal wave of new issues has been the Securities and Exchange Commission, but there’s a growing sense that the dam will burst soon and that a flood of new active exchange-traded issues will reach the market by year’s end as a result.But there’s a real question over whether this next big thing will actually be big at all.To see why — and to decide whether you want to get involved in the new issues or wait for them to prove themselves — you must first get some background.ETFs are mutual funds built to trade like stocks, trading minute-by-minute instead of being priced at the end of the day. Typically, they’re based on indexes, although there are a few actively managed issues like PIMCO Total Return /quotes/zigman/8989199/delayed/quotes/nls/bond BOND +0.0019%  , as well as active-index and leveraged issues to say that active ETFs already are available.There is also a suite of ETFs offered by the Vanguard Group that are, effectively, a share class of Vanguard’s traditional funds, but because Vanguard holds a patent on the process for simply creating an ETF share class of an existing fund, the rest of the industry has been unable to follow suit.ETFs make daily portfolio disclosures — meaning the investor knows what they own — and typically have lower costs.Portfolio disclosure, however, is a major impediment to the creation of active ETFs because many fund managers don’t want the world to know what’s in their secret sauce.The SEC is also an impediment, because creating an active ETF requires special dispensation from the regulatory agency, which has been tightening up its approvals of late, mostly in the hope of creating a new standard that all fund firms can use.T. Rowe Price, BlackRock and Vanguard all are pushing their own variations, but the most promising take on this is the ETMF, for “exchange-traded managed fund,” put forward by Navigate Fund Solutions, a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Management.ETMFs would offer “NAV-based trading,” where the fund trades at its end-of-day net asset value — like a traditional fund — eliminating the need for the daily portfolio disclosure.While the trade will be executed using the end-of-the-day price, it will occur at a premium or discount to the price that is determined by the market. In short, you could buy an ETF at 10 a.m., with the agreed-upon price being “NAV plus two cents,” meaning your trade will cost you two pennies more than the price of the fund that is determined at the end of the day.Tough to follow? You bet.That’s why SEC insiders say it is not the Division of Investment Management — which oversees the fund world — that is delaying active ETFs, so much as the Division of Trading and Markets, which is trying to make sure that they’re not creating a new playground for arbitrageurs, where average investors think they are getting that next big thing, only to find the benefits bled off by sharpies and hacks.In the end, there should be a ruling on most of the new forms of active ETFs by Thanksgiving, at which point investors will have to decide whether they’re seeing a fabulous bounty or a squawking turkey.For all of the hype around active ETFs, consider that while exchange-traded funds hold $1.8 trillion in total assets, just $50 billion of that is in active issues. That paucity of dollars could be because there aren’t many active issues to choose from, or it could be because investors aren’t clamoring for active ETFs at all.Even with standard ETFs, more than 40% of those created have less than $50 million in assets, the point where experts say a fund starts to be worth management’s time to keep it open.“The SEC would like to put all of the models on the table together and have a little bit of everything rolled into whatever they approve, so that what you wind up with is about 80% of each proposal wrapped into one rule that gets approved,” said Tom Lydon, editor of ETF Trends. “The question is just how much demand there will be for it. You know why the firms are doing it, but you wonder why consumers would buy into it, at least until these issues are proven.”Added Geoff Bobroff of Bobroff Consulting: “I can see my children buying active ETFs or ETMFs someday, but that day isn’t going to be at the end of this year if that’s when we see SEC approval and a lot of new funds to choose from. … These will be the next big thing to talk about, but that doesn’t make them the next big thing to invest in, certainly when they are new but possibly ever.”More from MarketWatch :10 biggest S&P 500 winners and losers for 2014J.P.

Gold scores biggest monthly gain since February	By Myra P. Saefong, MarketWatchGold for August delivery /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.05%  tacked on $2, or 0.2%, for the session to settle at $1,322 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.Prices for the yellow metal, tracking the most-active contracts, saw gains of around 6.1% for the month and 3% for the quarter.It’s unlikely that traders will take any large bets ahead of the U.S. nonfarm payroll data due out on Thursday, said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade. “It is the most important data on earth, and it can cause a big fluctuation for gold and especially given the GDP data print last week.”Last week, data showed that the U.S. economy contracted by 2.9% in the first quarter, marking the biggest drop since early 2009.Gold saw little reaction to U.S. reports released Monday showing that Chicago PMI retreated in June and May pending home sales jumped 6.1%.Over in Europe, inflation in the euro zone remained stable at 0.5% in June, missing forecasts of a 0.6% reading ahead of the ECB’s meeting on Thursday.The “wild card” for the market is the geopolitical tensions, said Chris Gaffney, senior market strategist at EverBank Wealth Management, who mentioned Iraq, Ukraine and North Korea, in particular. “Any flare up in these areas could quickly lead to another round of ‘safe haven’ buying in the precious metals,” he said.On Comex Monday, September silver /quotes/zigman/12294966/delayed SIU4 +0.30% fell nearly 8 cents, or 0.4%, to settle at $21.06 an ounce following a gain of around 0.6% last week.

White House decries birth control ruling	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The White House on Monday said it disagreed with the Supreme Courts most recent birth control ruling. President [Barack] Obama believes that women should make personal health care decisions for themselves, rather than their bosses deciding for them, said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. The administration would respect the ruling but work with Congress to solve the problem it creates, he added. Earnest said the administration would also work to assess whether Obama could take any other executive action to counter it. The administration was still working on how many companies and employees are impacted by the ruling, Earnest said.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=D38992D4-99A1-47C4-8CEA-099228B82B14&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

Oscar Pistorius evaluated as mentally fit	By Devon MaylieOscar Pistorius returned to court on Monday to face the final weeks of his murder trial after a month-long psychiatric evaluation. The judge presiding over the murder trial, Thokozile Masipa, received two reports compiled after a four-week assessment of the Olympic and Paralympic runner by a team of psychiatrists and psychologists at state-run Weskoppies Hospital in Pretoria.Prosecutor Gerrie Nel read segments of the reports to the court which stated that Pistorius didn’t suffer from a mental illness or defect that hindered his ability to know right from wrong, and that he didn’t suffer from any mental illness that would render him not criminally responsible for his actions on Valentine’s Day last year, when he fired four shots through a locked bathroom door killing his girlfriend.Pistorius’s trial for shooting model Reeva Steenkamp has taken longer than expected, in part because of breaks caused by the 27-year-old athlete’s frequent sobbing and occasional vomiting.The 30-day psychiatric assessment was the latest delay.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=393187A4-0074-11E4-8470-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30
Fed’s Williams hits back at critics like Stanford’s Taylor	By Greg Robb, MarketWatchIn a speech to bankers meeting in Sun Valley, Idaho on Monday, Williams said the Fed’s bond buying and low interest rates were like a cast on a broken leg.“When you break a leg, you don’t just snap the pieces back into place; you leave the cast on until the bone heals. Otherwise, you risk doing even greater damage,” said Williams, a close ally of Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen who becomes a voting member next year.Taylor has said that the Fed should have already hiked short-term interest rates and ended bond purchases. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal , Taylor said Fed policy is holding the economy back.Williams meanwhile said the Fed is already taking steps towards the exit and its easy policy is not permanent.Although the Fed won’t raise interest rates for some time, “we’re moving towards normalization, and as the economy continues to improve, we’ll take off the cast; when it’s able to move on its own, we’ll take away the walking stick,” he said.Williams said the biggest mistake the Fed could have made would have been to throw up its hands and say economic woes were beyond the powers of the central bank.“It’s crucial to understand both the power and limits of the tools at your disposal. Not believing in their strength is effectively relinquishing responsibility; and once you relinquish responsibility, you’ve failed in your mandate,” Williams said.“The events of the past several years demanded strong policy action, and we were right to take it,” he said.He also dismissed suggestions that the Fed was an “enabler” for Washington intransigence over fiscal policy.He said that implies that the only prompt to Congressional action would be an economy in free-fall.Williams was upbeat about the economic outlook.He said the economy would rebound in the second quarter after the dismal first quarter reading and grow above 3% for the next two years.Inflation would rise only gradually toward the Fed’s 2% target.Williams said that an unemployment rate of 5.25% was about the lowest one could expect in a healthy economy.“So with the current unemployment rate at 6.3%, there’s still a way to go before we’re at full employment,” he said.Also read: Janet Yellen’s neighbors complain about securityHobby Lobby decision electrifies Capitol Hill	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=D4E50782-006C-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

Revised GDP number raises more questions	By Bill GundersonA recession would be horrible news for the housing market, the job market, and the stock market. However, it would be good for bond investors who hope to avoid the impact of an increase in interest rates. Let’s dive in.Weak consumerAlthough consumer-confidence figures remain high, reaching their highest level in six years, and consumer sentiment continues to improve, performance for most retailers has not been very strong. Consumer-discretionary stocks in general have not been a vibrant sector. Retail stocks that had been delivering strong numbers (in previous years) such as TJ Maxx /quotes/zigman/243683/delayed/quotes/nls/tjx TJX +0.17% , Ross Stores /quotes/zigman/77604/delayed/quotes/nls/rost ROST +0.28% and Tractor Supply /quotes/zigman/56321/delayed/quotes/nls/tsco TSCO +1.25% , have been very poor performers since late last year.In the restaurant group, casual-dining stocks Darden Restaurants /quotes/zigman/151942/delayed/quotes/nls/dri DRI +0.13% , the owner of Olive Garden, and Panera Bread /quotes/zigman/65095/delayed/quotes/nls/pnra PNRA +1.08%  have also demonstrated poor sales. There are definite pockets of weakness in the economy.So are the -2.9% GDP results in the first quarter evidence that the economic expansion is waning? We are now in the sixth year of an economic expansion, and no economic expansion lasts forever. Besides weakness in the consumer sector, the Fed has also started reducing liquidity, creating further cause for concern.Market reactionWhat is interesting to me was how the market reacted to the news. The stock market actually traded up and continued to rally toward new highs. If the market thought we were going into recession, that would not be the case. I look at the market as a leading indicator.There are still several sectors of the market demonstrating strength, such as the Internet, biotech, pharmaceutical, health-care, energy and transportation sectors. Would these sectors be trading so well if the market thought we were heading for a recession?So, based on the market reaction to the negative GDP number, investors have concluded that last quarters GDP is one and done, a one-time anomaly. Even though stock-market returns are not as high as last year, the five-year, three-month-old bull market is still very intact.Some areas of the economy may be losing some steam, as evidenced by weakness in consumer stocks, but there is enough strength in the economy to lead me to conclude that recession is not lurking around the corner, and that the stock market remains the best place to be.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=04475F7B-89A5-45F6-979A-9E1F2D90ECC9&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

Fed policy on road back to normal, Williams says	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The Federal Reserves easy policy stance is not permanent and is already waning, said John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, on Monday. In a speech to bankers in Sun Valley, Idaho, Williams hit back at critics of the central bank who said the Fed should not be continuing with bond purchases and low interest rates so long after the end of the recession. Referring to the economy as a patient with a broken leg, Williams said that Fed policy had to stay on while the economy healed. You leave the cast on until the bone heals, or else you could do even greater damage, he said. Although the Fed is not close to raising interest rates weve already considerably reduced the pace of our asset purchases, which will likely end this year, he said. As the economy continues to improve well take off the cast; when its able to move on its own, well take away the walking stick, Williams added. He was upbeat about the outlook, seeing growth above 3% in 2015 and 2016 and inflation moving gradually back toward the Feds 2% target.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E93D71CB-954E-4919-905E-7906C2290CC8&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

Court deals a blow to liberals, but not a fatal one	By Rex Nutting, MarketWatchBut the rulings do not go nearly as far as some apoplectic liberals feared or as celebratory conservatives wanted. As is typical with the court, the rulings are narrowly written to avoid overturning long-standing precedents.In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby , the most widely followed case decided today, the court ruled that closely held companies are not required to pay for health insurance for their employees that includes contraceptive services if the owners of the companies have religious objections. A closely held company is one that is owned by five or fewer people.In other words, the ruling does not apply to publicly owned companies or to privately owned companies that have more than five partners. Most workers are unaffected by today’s ruling.The constitutional issues (whether companies have a First Amendment right to freedom of religion) was not settled today. It’s likely that the contraception mandate will go forward for the vast majority of people who get their health insurance through an employer.And the court seems unlikely to extend the logic of Hobby Lobby to cases where a company uses a religious belief to discriminate against blacks, women or gays.In the second case decided today, the court ruled that home health workers in Illinois are not required to pay union dues if they do not want to be members of the union that bargains with the state on behalf of all workers.This is a case that pro-workers’ rights groups feared would destroy public-sector unions, and with it the Democratic PartyHowever, the justices did not overturn a longstanding precedent that requires all covered employees to pay fees to a public-sector union that bargains on their behalf. In his majority opinion in Harris v. Quinn, Justice Samuel Alito takes a lot of pot shots at their previous precedent, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, but the majority did not overturn Abood, as many liberals had feared.Instead, the court ruled that the home health-care workers were not full-fledged public employees. Typically, these workers negotiate directly with their clients about most of their working conditions, but their salary is set in negotiations with the state of Illinois.The court dealt a blow to liberals on Monday, but the blow wasn’t fatal. The door was opened for a stronger ruling against mandatory union dues, or for a stronger ruling upholding the religious rights of corporations, but the court did not walk through that door.Also read these stories:Supreme Court says some firms don’t need to cover contraceptionSupreme Court limits power to force union contributions	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=133A90DA-0066-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

Recap: J.P. Morgans Dimon says prognosis for cancer throat is excellent	jpmYour browser does not support iframes.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/272085/delayed /quotes/nls/jpm JPM chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and CFO Marianne Lake will be addressing investors and analysts this morning, after the bank handily beat profit and revenue estimates in the second quarter. The bank reported investment banking revenues fell 31%, while FICC revenue dropped 10% in the quarter.Follow along as MarketWatch’s Sital PatelAlso read: A difficult quarter again seen for banks Jamie Dimon kicks of the call by talking about his health.  The CEO was recently diagnosed with throat cancer.“To start with I feel great,” he says.“I think I have some of the best doctors in the world and I’ll be receiving the best treatment and I’m very fortunate.”Doctors have told the CEO the cancer is confined to the original site in the adjacent lymph nodes in the right side of his neck and isolated to that specific area.“The cancer has not spread. Importantly, with all the tests they’ve done, there’s no evidence of cancer  anywhere else in my body, and it’s curable with radiation and chemotherapy standard for this kind of cancer and the prognosis is excellent.”Dimon goes onto to tell analysts and investors that the bank’s board will be fully briefed on his condition.Expect the next disclosure in about a few weeks when the therapy is over.“I’m feeling better and the prognosis is excellent.”Dimon’s doctors have finalized the treatment plans over the last several days. The CEO expects to be actively involved in managing the business., throughout his treatment.The treatment is expected to last seven weeks.CEO Dimon on succession plans: “There is no change whatsoever, the board has plans in place with various scenarios and we’re fortunate enough to have an exceptional group of executives.“The board has been fully engaged with the senior leaders the whole time they’ve been at this company.”Dimon was just on a three-week trip to Asia, says he was reachable any time.Jamie Dimon very upfront about his health — fortunately still sounds optimistic. $JPM— Brad Ginesin (@polar_cap) July 15, 2014CFO Marianne Lake talks about the bank’s second-quarter results.Expect J.P. Morgan’s /quotes/zigman/272085/delayed /quotes/nls/jpm JPM results in the second half of the year to be similar tothe first half, says CFO.  June was a better month but July doesn’t look as good.The banking environment remains solid, with a large M&A pipeline and backlog.FICC down 15% and equity trading down 10%FICC decline was driven broadly by macro activity and volumes were low.Equities decline was driven by derivatives. CFO on outlook, says she expects the current environment to persist into the third quarter and second half of the year.“Also to experience normal seasonal trends for the third quarter we generally expect mortgage production to be similar to this quarter – a small negative.“We expect firm-wide adjusted expenses for the full-year of $50 billion plus or minus, and expect credit trends to continue to be very strong across the board with consumer reserve releases that will be more periodic and modest.”What is this witchcraft? Financials still making tons of money! $GS $JPM— Arthur Burkham (@unincarty) July 15, 2014For more on Dimon’s comments on throat cancer diagnosis here. Analyst question on the possibility of Fed raising capital ratios for the largest bank.Dimon responds by saying they will wait and see.“..remember the United States is already gone beyond most other countries…”CFO says they continue to run the bank on what they know today with one eye on the future. Analyst Guy Moszkowski asks about expense guidance.Bank is looking to run bank more efficiently to reduce some “sloppy” waste.But don’t mistake that the firm is cutting expenses when it comes to the important elements the bank needs for the future.The bank will cut costs and seek efficiencies, but not in a way that would hurt the business.CFO mentions mortgage headcount.  Down approximately 5000-year-to-date.“We expect to exceed our Investor Day prediction of approximately 6,000 (cuts)  for the full-year 2014.”CLSA analyst Mike Mayo asks why FICC results were better than guidance?CFO Lake says on absolute performance, the bank had better activity in June. “Every day on average did better than prior two months.”It’s very hard to predict FICC, it’s very hard to do it, the bar jumps around, notes CEO Dimon.Mayo follows up with a question about loan growth guidance.CFO expects JPM will see similar growth in the second half of the year.“Generally we are seeing better sentiment,” said Lake. “It’s our belief we’ll have strong year-over-year growth in the second half, but we are in the early stages of that to happen.”Analysts ask about legal costs and what the outstanding material mortgage litigation is for the bank.CFO Marianne Lake says JPM is not going to be able to talk about what they are reserving for, but they had very little in the first quarter of $700 million pretax.“It’s going to be this way for a while, we’re going to have litigation costs as we work through the issues that you’re aware of and with respect to mortgages, we have a large proportion of RMBS risk with the governmental counterparties, and we still have some other civil claims and we’re working through it.”After Citigroup Inc. /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed /quotes/nls/c C settled for $7 billion this week on bad mortgage securities and CDOs related to the financial crisis, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy L. Graseck asks about J.P. Morgan  CDOs.Dmion says it’s “not material.”Following up with “Runoff over time for risk-weighted assets, everything else is not material.”J.P. Morgan shares up 3.5% in early trading.jpmYour browser does not support iframes.Analyst Eric Wasserstrom of Suntrust notes that the bank’s results were better than expected, does that mean things are accelerating ahead of their timeline?CEO Dimon responds by saying he does not run the company for quarterly profits, but instead looks at running and growing the businesses over the next five to ten years.“I honestly don’t care whether FICC is up 10% or 15% or down 10% to 15%. I think that’s a complete waste of time.”Best line of $JPM analyst call so far: “We’re going to put elbow to the metal,” Mr. Dimon says.— John Carney (@carney) July 15, 2014On being involved in FHA loans, Dimon says the bank will be cautious based on past experience and litigation.“We want to help the consumer there, but we can’t do it at great risk to JPMorgan and until they come up with some kind of Safe Harbor or something we’re going to be very, very cautious in that line of business.”Dimon says the U.S. needs to change tax policy. Read full story here.Dimon says one more thing on FHA loans.“It’s the reps and warrants, the commercial resolution in the dispute but you don’t want triple damages if something goes wrong. J.P. Morgan is waiting for some kind of guidance from the government going forward, said Dimon. Call is concluded after an hour and a half of comments from JPM executives and questions from analysts.The Tell is MarketWatch’s fast and engaging look at trends and themes in the day’s markets.

GM compensation plan to offer payments for accidents	By Jeff BennettUnder the program, Mr. Feinberg will provide compensation checks ranging from $20,000 to several million dollars to any driver, passenger, pedestrian or occupant of another vehicle who can show they were hurt in a crash involving one of 2.6 million cars GM has recalled after admitting they were equipped with faulty ignition switches.The program has no overall limit, but a key condition is that the claimants show the vehicle’s air bags didn’t deploy in the crash, he said.“If an air bag deployed, you’re out,” Mr. Feinberg said.Any out-of-court death settlements connected to ignition switch litigation can be refiled, Mr. Feinberg said. If a new amount is applied, the money already paid out will be deducted from the total and a check cut to cover the remainder. Lawyers for some crash victims who settled with GM /quotes/zigman/1466682/delayed/quotes/nls/gm GM 0.00%   before it admitted to the ignition switch defects in February have sought to reopen those agreements on grounds that the auto maker improperly concealed information about the problem, which could cut power to air bags, power steering and power brakes.GM has agreed to pay as many eligible claims that exist. Mr. Feinberg said GM has collected evidence of 3,500 death and injury claims involving the 2.6 million ignition switch vehicles, but those claims have yet to be vetted to see if they meet the requirements for the compensation plan.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:New TSA fees to make airfare more expensiveJ.P.

How diet soda can sabotage your diet	By Quentin Fottrell, MarketWatchNew York’s highest court struck down former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s May 2012 proposal to ban the sale of supersized sodas. The former mayor wanted to prevent restaurants, food carts, delis, sports stadiums and movie-theater concession stands from selling sugary drinks in cups larger than 16 ounces. Some treated it as a “nanny state” proposal. Shortly after the 2012 plans were announced, some fast-food joints found a way around the ban: Dunkin’ Donuts unveiled signs telling customers that they could add their own sugar and “flavor swirls” to large and extra-large beverages.Researchers are divided over whether diet soda helps people lose weight. Swapping sugary drinks for diet drinks may condition the body to expect calories, which makes people feel hungrier. “Normally, things that taste sweet are followed by sugar and calories,” Susan Swithers, a professor of psychological sciences and a behavioral neuroscientist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. who has reviewed studies on diet soda . “But the body produces physiological responses — increasing metabolism and releasing hormones — to anticipate the arrival of sugar and calories,” she says.That, Swithers says, can become a problem for diet soda fanatics. Diet drinks interfere with this “predictable relationship,” meaning the body can’t predict the calorie intake when real sugars are consumed. “Physiological responses become blunted,” she says, and that may lead to a host of other problems too. “The loss of these responses could contribute to excess food intake, weight gain, high blood pressure and over time outcomes like diabetes and cardiovascular disease,” Swithers says. In fact, she says Bloomberg’s soda ban should have been extended to artificially sweetened drinks too.In one study, individuals who consumed more than three artificially sweetened drinks a day experienced a doubling of their incidence of overweight/obesity over the next 7 to 8 years, compared with those who had consumed none, according to a study published in the August 2008 edition of “ Obesity .” “The more they drank them, the more their waist circumference increased,” says Sharon Fowler, the primary author of the study and specialist in the department of medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.Also see: 10 things the soda industry won’t sayWhile these results show an association or correlation rather than causation, Fowler says there may be physiological and psychological issues at play. One theory: Drinking artificial sweeteners may cause the body to store more calories in fat cells and also induce hunger, she says. “Studies have shown if animals are fed artificial sweeteners they gain more weight and have more disruption than metabolic imbalance,” she says. “No calories and no consequences is very naive. Diet soda consumption in the U.S. is a major uncontrolled experiment.” She says Bloomberg naively targeted only sugary drinks.In fact, overweight and obese adults drink more diet beverages than healthy-weight adults — yet still consume significantly more food calories than overweight and obese adults who drink sugar-sweetened beverages, a study published in the January 2014 “ American Journal of Public Health ” found. It looked at cross-sectional data of nearly 24,000 Americans over a 10-year period, says co-author Sara Bleich, associate professor of health policy at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore “The folks that drink diet sodas consume a lot more calories,” she says.Others disagree: A body of research supports that low-calorie sweeteners, such as those found in diet beverages, can help reduce calorie intake and aid in maintaining a healthy weight, a spokeswoman for the American Beverage Association says. “There are a number of studies that show the benefits of diet beverages, which are 99% water,” she adds. One 2012 study published in the “ American Journal of Clinical Nutrition ” suggests people can use diet beverages to lose weight, she adds. (Replacement of caloric beverages with noncaloric beverages as a weight-loss strategy resulted in average weight losses of 2% to 2.5%, it found.)One recent study published in the May 2014 edition of “ Obesity ” found that 150 people lost 13 pounds drinking diet soda as part of a 12-week weight-loss program, while 150 people who drank water only lost 9 pounds. The study was funded by the American Beverage Association, but one of the co-authors of the study, John Peters, professor of medicine in the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center at the University of Colorado, says the study was independent and a third party monitored the data. “All they did was provide the money,” he says.People in the study who drank diet soda actually reported being less hungry, Peters says. Of course, the study was only 12 weeks long and was conducted as part of a weight management program, so Bleich says it’s no surprise they lost weight. “Most people lose the most weight in the first three to eight months,” Peters responds, adding that there was a nine-month follow-up period. But it’s also unrealistic to study people drinking diet sodas in an uncontrolled — real world — setting and expect them to lose weight, he says. “Weight loss is mostly between the ears,” he adds. “You have to want it. It’s a commitment.”Other articles by Quentin Fottrell:Drinking diet soda linked to heart diseaseCoke, like America, sweetens on SteviaIs America facing a beer crisis?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8DA8B6D0-FD78-11E3-B93C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

Pending home sales highest in eight months	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- A gauge of pending home sales jumped 6.1% in May to reach the highest level in eight months, signaling that upcoming closings of existing homes are likely to speed up, the National Association of Realtors reported Monday. The index of pending home sales hit 103.9 in May, compared with 97.9 in April. Low mortgage rates, a growing number of homes on the market and stronger job creation will all fuel more deals, NAR said. Although pending sales have risen three months in row, first-quarter closings were weak enough that NAR expects them to drag down 2014s total sales tally below last years result. In May the pending-sales gauge was down 5.2% from a year earlier. By region, Mays gauge of pending home sales rose 8.8% in the Northeast, 7.6% in the West, 6.3% in the Midwest and 4.4% in the South. Pending sales typically close within two months. An index reading of 100 equals 2001s average contract activity level.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7490A4ED-25D5-4488-9899-BEB39D5E41DF&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

These two debt payments may be heard around the world	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchArgentina is expected to enter technical default for the second time in less than 15 years as the pariah of the debt markets negotiates with creditors in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling mandating payouts to a group of hedge funds. The South American nation’s negotiations are already rewriting the rules of sovereign debt restructuring.Separately, a Puerto Rican agency is on watch for a potential default Tuesday after the U.S. commonwealth passed a law allowing its public corporations to restructure their municipal bond debt last week. Puerto Rico’s bonds are held in a wide array of municipal bond funds because of their exemption from federal, state, and local taxes, which means a default could portend broader pain in the market for local government bonds.Argentina has for years been locked in a legal battle with a group of hedge funds that refused to take an earlier restructuring deal on bonds that defaulted in 2001. Investors, led by Paul Singer’s NML Capital, have demanded to be paid in full due to a clause in Argentine bond documents that says the country can’t pay some bondholders without paying the others, called pari passu.The country’s leadership has called these investors “vulture funds,” a reference to the tactic of buying up distressed debt at low prices and taking steps to enhance the payout. The country has sought to forego payments to the holdouts while paying the rest of the creditors — and it has generated a lot of publicity in the process. The nation has said it cannot afford to pay the vultures while also paying the investors who accepted the restructuring deal years ago.The case has been making its way through U.S. courts for years, but the Supreme Court handed the hedge funds a major victory earlier this month when it declined to take up the case. That left in place a lower court ruling mandating Argentina must pony up the money to Singer & Co.Argentina has a payment due on its restructured debt on June 30, but if it can’t work out a deal to pay the holdouts, it must miss the Monday deadline to pay the restructured bonds. That triggers a technical default, setting in motion a 30-day grace period before it becomes a full-fledged nonpayment.The government tried to deposit money in a fund to pay on the restructured bonds last week, but a federal judge rebuffed that action, saying that it can’t pay on the restructured bonds without making good on the money owed to the holdouts. If those creditors manage to get full payment from Argentina, it may impact the willingness of other sovereign debt bondholders to accept a restructuring in the future.Investors remain hopeful that a deal will be reached. The Argentina Merval stock index /quotes/zigman/1467195/delayed AR:MERV -0.05%  dropped sharply in the wake of the Supreme court decision, though it has since rebounded. The index is on track to gain 2.5% this month. Argentine bond prices were stable Monday, according to Dow Jones newswires.The economically beleaguered commonwealth of Puerto Rico took municipal bond investors by surprise last week when it passed legislation that allows the island’s public corporations to negotiate a debt restructuring. These corporations, in particular the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority and the Puerto Rico Highway & Transportation Authority, issued nearly a third of the approximately $73 billion of the island’s outstanding bonds.“This legislation is a reaction to the very real economic and fiscal stress experienced by all Puerto Rico entities since 2006,” wrote Barclays analysts, led by Thomas Weyl, in a report late last week.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=659F42F0-004B-11E4-B2B1-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

Halliburton shares soar 40%, with maybe more on tap	By Philip van Doorn, MarketWatchThe company’s stock has risen more than five times that of the S&P 500 this year to within a dollar of a record high. It’s in the top 20 among members of the benchmark index. And most analysts who cover the energy-services giant recommend that their clients buy the shares.Still, Halliburton /quotes/zigman/228631/delayed/quotes/nls/hal HAL +0.21%  is in a volatile industry where geopolitical problems often get in the way of doing business.The Houston-based company is a major provider of hydraulic-fracturing services, also known as fracking, which has played a big role in the remarkable expansion of U.S. oil and natural gas production over the past decade. It also provides services for offshore drillers.The stock: Shares of Halliburton have returned 40% this year through Friday’s close at $70.47, outrunning the 7.2% return of the S&P 500. Despite the run-up, analyst sentiment for Halliburton remains overwhelmingly positive, with 28 of 34 those polled by FactSet having “buy” or “overweight” ratings, while five say hold and one sell.The strong performance has been supported by buybacks, which lowered the average count of shares outstanding by 8% in the year ended March 31.Bull case: Halliburton reported a 5% increase in first-quarter revenue to $7.3 billion, while operating income from oil well completion and production services rose 7% to $661 million, and operating income from declined slightly to $398 million. Earnings available to common shareholders were $622 million, or 73 cents a share, compared to a net loss of $18 million, or 1 cent, a year earlier, when the company recorded a $1 billion charge related to the Macondo well incident. That is better known as the Deepwater Horizon explosion in April 2010, which caused 11 deaths and a massive oil leak. The Deepwater Horizon facility was owned by Transocean Ltd. /quotes/zigman/531240/delayed/quotes/nls/rig RIG -0.85% , and was leased to a subsidiary of BP PLC /quotes/zigman/247026/delayed/quotes/nls/bp BP -0.43% .Among sell-side analysts who recommend investors buy Halliburton is James Wicklund of Jefferies, who on June 23 raised his price target for the stock by a dollar to $79.“Halliburton is the best-positioned oil-field-services company to see revenue, margin and return growth over the next several years,” Wicklund wrote in a note to clients. “While having excellent peers, its product lines, geography demographics and focus points are lining up well with the evolving macro outlook and the company continues to execute strongly. Halliburton has the highest return on capital in its peer groups and, while No. 2 in terms of margins, those margins are improving.”Bear case: The dramatic expansion of oil and natural gas production in the United States has been supported by both major political parties and has even led to a loosening of rules banning crude oil exports by the Obama administration. Long-term risks for the company could include a change in the political climate, but this isn’t expected to affect the oil and gas industry any time soon.Oil and natural gas prices have risen this year, with plenty of market uncertainty from a possible disruption to the flow of natural gas needed by Western European countries, since so much gas flows from Russia through Ukraine, as well as the civil war in Iraq, which now involves Iran and Syria. A general easing of tensions could cause oil and gas prices to tumble at some point, but there’s always plenty of risk either way.More from MarketWatch:4 things GoPro needs to do to succeedBe wary of ‘new and improved’ mutual fundsIKEA and 7 others that pay above minimum wage	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A4C9902C-FC98-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30
10 biggest S&P 500 winners and losers for 2014	By Philip van Doorn, MarketWatchThe S&P 500 Index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.55%  has returned 7% this year through Thursday. That might seem lousy when compared with the 32% return (with reinvested dividends) during 2013, but it’s on pace to beat the historical average by a wide margin. (That’s not to say it will, of course.)The strongest S&P 500 sector this year has been Utilities, up 17%, as a number of large players have agreed to pay significant takeout premiums to enlarge their regulated distribution businesses. Regulated electric and natural gas distribution has been a far safer play than commodity-driven wholesale and trading activities.The S&P 500 Energy sector is up 13%, with Oil & Gas Equipment and Services rising 28%, Oil & Gas Storage and Transportation up 25% and Oil & Gas Exploration up 22%. We drilled down into the S&P 1500 Composite last week to identify five cheap energy stocks that were lagging sector competitors, while revisiting a previous and more conservative list that has done quite well since being highlighted in early May.But all is not rosy.The decision by the Obama administration to lift a four-decade ban on U.S. exports of crude oil is another boost for oil producers, but is a bitter pill for refiners, which have suffered from soft domestic oil prices. The S&P 500 Oil & Gas Refining and Marketing subsector is up only 2% this year.The weakest S&P 500 sector so far this year has been Retailing, which we explored in depth in 12 bargain-bin stocks to buy low. We also recently considered the potential to make money by taking long positions in heavily shorted stocks, including three retail names.Then there are the ubiquitous warnings of a coming market correction, which could come true, as the S&P 500 Index continues to set records . For one thing, equity prices have been supported for many years by an expanding money supply thanks to global central banks.The Federal Reserve plans to finish winding down its “QE3” bond purchases by the end of the year. By the middle of 2015, most economists expect the Fed to make another major policy change, which is to allow the short-term federal funds rate to rise from its current target range of zero to 0.25%, where it has been locked since late 2008. There will be plenty of pressure on equity pries as the central bank begins to trim its bloated balance sheet.Another thing to consider is price-to-earnings valuation. The S&P 500 trades for 14.8 times aggregate 2015 earnings estimates among analysts polled by FactSet. That’s up from a forward P/E ratio of 13.1 a year ago, and the forward P/E for the index hasn’t been this high since 2007.Here are the 10 S&P 500 stocks with the highest total returns so far this year:There are three oil and gas names among the top 10. The remarkable increase in U.S. oil and natural gas continues, driving revenue and profit increases for many companies. Rising oil and gas prices have also helped, driven in part by uncertainty in Iraq and Ukraine.Here’s a rundown about each of the 10 best performers among S&P 500 stocks this year:Newfield Exploration Co. /quotes/zigman/133327/delayed/quotes/nls/nfx NFX -0.43%  is the top S&P 500 performer this year, although it has the worst five-year total return among this group.The company’s first-quarter revenue rose 49% to $553 million, while net income from continuing operations came in at $24 million, or 17 cents a share, improving from a loss of $25 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier. The company recently sold its oil business in Malaysia, and is in the midst of divesting its operations in China. Newfield is expanding its operations in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma, the Uinta Basin in Utah and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.Nabors Industries Ltd. /quotes/zigman/306432/delayed/quotes/nls/nbr NBR +0.07%  is an oil driller that also provides various services to manage oil wells through their entire life cycles. The shares trade for 15 times the consensus 2015 earnings estimate of $1.93, among analysts polled by FactSet. That’s the lowest forward P/E ratio among the 10 winners listed here.The stock rose 6% Thursday after Nabors announced an agreement to merge its well-completion and production business with C&J Energy Services Inc. /quotes/zigman/6005274/delayed/quotes/nls/cjes CJES +0.28% .Forest Laboratories Inc.  is one of two pharmaceutical companies on the top 10 list. The five-year total return for the stock is 296%, which compares with a return of 137% for the S&P 500.The stock rose 28% on Feb. 18 after the company agreed to be acquired by Actavis PLC /quotes/zigman/22587972/delayed/quotes/nls/act ACT -0.05% for $25 billion in cash and stock. The deal, when announced, was valued at $89.40 a share for a premium of 25%. That sets a floor for the stock, assuming the deal is completed.Keurig Green Mountain Inc. /quotes/zigman/30382045/delayed/quotes/nls/gmcr GMCR +0.87%  is up 60% this year, and the stock’s stellar five-year return of 547% is second-highest on this list.Highlights for Keurig this year have included a 10-year agreement with Coca-Cola Co. /quotes/zigman/222647/delayed/quotes/nls/ko KO -0.14% , through which the companies will collaborate on the new Keurig Gold “at-home beverage system.” That pushed Keurig’s shares up 26% on Feb. 6.The stock rose 13% on May 8 after Keurig Green Mountain reported a 10% increase in net sales for the 13-week period ended March 29 to $1.1 billion, with an 18% increase in EPS to $1.03.Electronic Arts Inc. /quotes/zigman/71356/delayed/quotes/nls/ea EA +0.44%  rose 21% on May 7, after the console and mobile game maker reported a 21% increase in cash flow from operations to $281 million. For all of fiscal 2014, which ended March 31, net cash provided by operating activities more than doubled to $712 million, allaying investor fears.EA also estimated adjusted net revenue for 2015 would grow 2% to $4.10 billion. The company expects, on a GAAP basis, to earn $2.37 a share in 2015, compared with only 3 cents in 2014.Allergan Inc. /quotes/zigman/217110/delayed/quotes/nls/agn AGN -0.83%  is the maker of Botox. The stock has been very much “in play” this year, with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. /quotes/zigman/122461/delayed/quotes/nls/vrx VRX 0.00%  making multiple unsolicited takeout offers.Allergan continues to resist Valeant’s marriage entreaties, and there was speculation over the past week that it could attempt a major acquisition of its own to fend off the advances.Williams Companies Inc. /quotes/zigman/246527/delayed/quotes/nls/wmb WMB -0.41%  runs natural gas pipelines and also provides various other transportation, development and production services to other companies.The company on June 15 announced an agreement purchase half of general partner interest in Access Midstream Partners LP /quotes/zigman/10960080/delayed/quotes/nls/acmp ACMP -0.99%  and half of limited partner interest in ACMP for $6 billion in cash. After the deal is completed, Williams will own all of the general partner interest in ACMP and half of the LP interest.The transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter, after which Williams plans to raise its quarterly dividend to 56 cents from 43 cents. Based on the current payout and Thursday’s closing price of $58.10, the shares have a dividend yield of 2.96%.The deal is being partially funded by a $3 billion common offering that was completed June 23.Micron Technology Inc. /quotes/zigman/75433/delayed/quotes/nls/mu MU -0.09%  is up 47% this year and the stock has returned a remarkable 527% over the past five years. The semiconductor manufacturer has the advantage of providing memory in PCs as well as in mobile phones, tablets and other portable devices.For its fiscal third quarter ended May 29, Micron reported a 72% increase in sales to $3.98 billion, while net income grew to $839 million, or 68 cents a share, from $149 million, or 4 cents.SanDisk Corp. /quotes/zigman/54370/delayed/quotes/nls/sndk SNDK +0.72%  is the other semiconductor manufacturer on this list, and its stock has been the best performer over the past five years, with a total return of 599%. The company makes memory products for use in a wide variety of consumer and enterprise devices.The company on June 16 announced a deal to acquire Fusion-io Inc. /quotes/zigman/5375401/delayed/quotes/nls/fio FIO +0.18% for $1.1 billion in cash, net of cash assumed. SanDisk will make a tender offer of $11.25 a share, a 21% premium to Fusion-io’s closing price of $9.28 on June 13. The merger is expected to be completed during the third quarter.SanDisk CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in the press release announcing the agreement that the addition of Fusion-io would “accelerate our efforts to enable the flash-transformed data center, helping companies better manage increasingly heavy data workloads at a lower total cost of ownership.”Last among the 10 S&P 500 winners for the first half of 2014 is Pepco Holdings Inc. /quotes/zigman/286124/delayed/quotes/nls/pom POM +0.14% , an electric utility, which agreed on April 30 to be acquired by Exelon Corp. /quotes/zigman/252515/delayed/quotes/nls/exc EXC -1.79%  for $27.25 a share, a 24% premium.Please see five utility companies that are now takeover targets for more on the deal, and the consolidation trend for regulated electricity distribution. We followed up recently with an expanded list of 10 lagging utility stocks that could command huge M&A premiums.Please see the next page to read about the 10 S&amp;P 500 losers of 2014.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8298B204-FDFA-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

PPG to acquire Mexico’s Consorcio Comex for $2.3 billion	By Tess StynesPPG Chairman and Chief Executive Charles E. Bunch said the acquisition is complementary to the paint and coatings maker’s business because it “adds a leading architectural coatings business in Mexico and Central America, a region where we have negligible architectural coatings presence.”Pittsburgh-based PPG /quotes/zigman/238720/delayed/quotes/nls/ppg PPG +0.89%  , which makes coatings for the auto, aircraft and other markets, has been realigning its businesses in recent years to focus more on paint and other coatings from glass and chemicals.Mexico City-based Comex manufactures coatings and related products and reported sales of roughly $1 billion in 2013.The privately held company sell its products through about 3,600 stores, as well as regional retailers, wholesalers and direct sales to customers.PPG expects the deal to add immediately to earnings and it aims to achieve acquisition-related cost saving of 3% to 4% of acquired sales.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:New TSA fees to make airfare more expensive starting tomorrow7 reasons to love Google stock again10 states where drunk drivers kill the most people	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=4F0EE0D8-0053-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

Isis militants declare new Islamist state in Iraq, Syria	By Matt BradleyThe announcement, recited in Arabic on the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan by spokesman Abu Mohammed Al Adnani into an audio file, effectively renames the group the Islamic State, canceling its previous title of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, or ISIS.“We have had all the requirements of the Islamic state like fundraising, almsgiving, penalties, and prayers and still have only one thing which is the caliphate,” said Adnani in the recording. “The legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations, becomes null by the expansion of the caliph’s authority and arrival of its troops to their areas.”The spokesman also declares the group’s leader, Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, as the new Islamic State’s caliph. The recorded message was recorded on an Mp3 audio file and distributed through the group’s expansive social media presence.Sunday’s declaration is as much a shot over the bow of al Qaeda as it is an early declaration of victory over Baghdadi’s other enemies, such as the Iraqi government and its Iranian and Western backers.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.comMore must-reads from MarketWatch:10 biggest S&P winners and losers for 2014 so farUtilities, airlines seen at risk in second half of yearSex-video scandal hits GSK China chief	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C2BB5182-0031-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

EU sets up credit line for Bulgaria after bank runs	LONDON (MarketWatch) -- The European Commission has approved a request from Bulgaria to provide 3.3 billion lev ($2.3 billion) in funding to the countrys banking system. The approval of the credit line on Monday comes after runs last week on two of Bulgarias big banks, First Investment Bank and Corporate Commercial Bank, media reports said. Customers of First Investment Bank were sent phone messages or email telling them to withdraw their deposits, leading to long queues at branches, reports said. This created concerns about the liquidity of the bank in question and risked spilling over to some other institutions, despite the fact that the Bulgarian banking system is well capitalized and has high levels of liquidity compared to its peers in other Member States, the European Commission said in a statement. Bulgarias central bank said the banking system was being attacked in a bid to destabilize the country, and five people have been arrested on suspicion of spreading false information, the BBC said. Bulgarias main stock index, the Sofix, was up 4.3% on Monday.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=62B29F8C-C7E6-4D40-B400-7C99312C3BDA&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30
13 ways to meditate without sitting like a monk	By Paul B. Farrell, MarketWatchIn researching “The Millionaire Code: 16 Paths to Wealthbuilding,” I discovered that sitting really does work for only 20%. Yes, 8 in 10 of today’s busy folks are more suited to action. Get it? Odds are sitting’s not the best way for you, especially if you want the benefits of stress reduction, physical health, increased energy, higher productivity and success on the bottom line.What we saw was so many Americans doing things they love and, in the process, meditating. America already has 30 million runners, 72 million hikers, 50 million fishing, 25 million golfers, 85 million cycling, 25 million playing tennis. Tens of millions of active folks all meditating naturally, focusing on what they’re doing in this moment.Here’s our mini-course on meditation. You start with four simple do-it-yourself rules that work in all meditation systems, ancient and modern, personal and institutional, passive or active, secular and spiritual. Start today. You don’t need a guru. The idea initially hit me reading martial arts champion Chuck Norris’s “The Secret Power Within.” You can start with this anywhere, with any activity, at any time:First, you focus on what you’re doing in the moment. nothing else ... Second, remember that anything you are doing can become a meditation, anything ... Third, trust yourself, the results are within, you will know what works, that’s the best way for you ... Fourth, you keep it simple, knowing that everybody can meditate, it really is simply, natural, easy doing it your way.Here are 13 examples endorsing action-oriented meditation for most Americans:“Truthfully, I hate to meditate … Sitting still is not the only way to meditate. It’s simply the best known … You can meditate while exercising … pursuing a hobby … or playing a game … anything can be a meditation.”“Meditative is probably the best single word but it is different from Quaker meeting type meditation. … The rhythm of running is a strong element. Sometimes problems get solved while I am running or I think of things to say to people but it is not a figuring out process. More of a sudden flash of insight that comes when you are least trying to find an answer.”“Your mind is not here,” he said. I made no effort to deny he was right; students of martial arts soon learn that their teachers can see right through them. Standing there on the hard ground in Korea, I just bowed my head slightly and waited for Mr. Shin to continue. ‘What you are doing at the moment must be exactly what you are doing at the moment — and nothing else.’ … There’s a certain impatience about Zen, an unwillingness to get lost in meandering arguments, a desire to cut quickly to the essential, or to get to the bottom line.”“I’m married with seven kids. Been on Wall Street for 20 years. I’m the owner of a brokerage firm: 110 employees. I’m 6’4”, 225 pounds. I’ve lifted weights for years and I run. I played lacrosse at college, and basketball, football in high school. So I love sports. … I just thought yoga was … a weird Eastern thing. But that’s not true at all. … I feel stronger, more flexible. And it’s helped me with my golf … Mentally, it kind of clears your head. You can’t think about anything, but what you’re doing while you’re in there. It’s a good escape for me.”“When Mitchell (Spearman, golf instructor) and I first spoke, he remarked, ‘The spiritual stuff you think about is something I frequently experience on the golf course. I wish I could experience it when I’m not playing golf.’ I responded, ‘That’s how I feel most of the time, but I lose it when I play golf.’ We made a deal. I would teach Mitchell the rules that make the game of life a joyful, ecstatic expression. Mitchell would teach me the rules that make the game of golf a joyful, ecstatic experience. Guess what. They are the same rules.”“In daily life, there is precious little time to let our minds rest quietly. Our brains are so used to being fed a constant diet of stimulation … You can practice meditation anywhere, at any time — sitting in your car at a red light, eating dinner at a restaurant and, yes, backpacking along a trail. The most profound meditative states I’ve ever reached came while walking by myself along a trail deep in the backcountry, immersed completely in the world around me and within my own self. … Nature is one giant meditation room … provides us with an opportunity to turn down the volume of our everyday lives and become utterly connected with who we truly are.”“Just to sit with the line in the water” fishing “not moving, not really thinking about anything, not really caring about anything either, seems to draw out the inner tensions and frustrations that have prevented you from solving problems you couldn’t solve before.” Which oddly reminds me of a police commander friend who said when that his wife went to church he meditated while gardening in their back yard.“Sitting meditation, like repentance, is work … Walking, by contrast, is pure grace, an effortless art that produces surprising moments of spontaneous self-transcendence. When I walk, my mind leaps ahead, skips steps, and presents me with images and ideas out of nowhere. With surprising regularity the thoughts that come to me when I am on a long hike in the hills contain the breakthrough insights I have been unable to reach after weeks of hard intellectual or emotional work.”“There is a part of every marathon where something does take over…. the sensation of movement … You lose a sense of identity in yourself, you become running itself ... get a feeling of euphoria, almost real happiness… It is the platonic idea of knowing thyself. Running is getting to know yourself to an extreme degree.” As in cycling, tai chi, tennis.“The path of surfing, presents similarities with the paths of all people who have sought meaning and found their essence, whether through surfing, practicing zazen, or studying the Tao.” Surfing as dance? Reminds us St. Augustine once said: “O’ humans, learn to dance, otherwise the angels of Heaven won’t know what to do with you.”“Meditation ought to decrease the drivenness of our lives, not make it worse. That is why I say meditate for its own sake, as a hobby … a time when you can occupy your mind with something for its own sake, without getting caught up in any of your usual occupations.”“I’m in my car, on the highway. I turn off the news and the baseball game I’ve been listening to and switch to a Beethoven violin sonata that’s loaded in the CD player. Listening to the music, my mind gradually starts to release, like a hand that had been grasping something tightly and is beginning to let go. Another mind appears, a mind completely engaged with the pattern the music weaves. A moment before I had been frozen into the shape of a self in a world. Now, the music has thawed me out.”“Morning Pages are my way of meditating … three pages a day … they work for anyone, for painters, for sculptors, for poets, for actors, for lawyers, for housewives, for anyone who wants to try anything creative ... Lawyers who use them swear they make them more effective in court. … They are a potent form of meditation for hyperactive Westerners.”Bottom line: Meditation’s not what you think. No big secrets, No mantras, incense, bells, strange music, no sitting and no gurus. Think outside the box: Meditation is as simple, natural as breathing.Yes, most gurus, clinicians and experts will still defend sitting as the only way. It’s not. Sitting meditation works for maybe 20%. The other 80% meditate in action. And they do it without thinking they’re meditating, without even calling it meditation. They do what they love, and whatever they’re doing at the moment can be meditation. You’re at peace, you’re alive.If there is a secret, the secret may be that you can’t “not meditate,” that’s impossible. We all do it, naturally. It just happens. We do it often during the day, breathing, reading, rocking to music, walking, praying, exercising, sports, affirming goals, working in a positive mental attitude.Many years ago my mentor Joseph Campbell was asked by Alan Watts what’s your favorite meditation? Reading. Well, guess what ... today ... you’ve been “meditating” ... here, now ... for the past few minutes ... reading this column.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=65D84782-FE23-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30
GlaxoSmithKline China chief turned up in sex video	By Laurie BurkittThe British drug maker regarded the video—apparently shot without the executive’s knowledge—as a breach of security, the person said.The executive in the video, Mark Reilly, directed the company to hire a Shanghai-based private investigation firm run by a British national and his Chinese-born wife to investigate the breach, the person said.Those investigators — former journalist Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng, a naturalized U.S. citizen — subsequently were arrested by Chinese authorities last year and remain in custody. Official Chinese media said their investigative firm, ChinaWhys Co., had illegally gathered large amounts of personal information on Chinese citizens.Until this weekend’s disclosure about the video, it wasn’t clear whether ChinaWhys had been working for Glaxo /quotes/zigman/263563/delayed UK:GSK -0.22%  when its owners were seized by authorities. The details of the video were reported by Britain’s Sunday Times newspaper.The disclosures add new details to a series of events that has shaken up the U.K. drug maker’s operations in China and put the industry under a microscope.Chinese law enforcement in May accused Mr. Reilly of ordering subordinates to commit bribery that generated billions of yuan in revenue for Glaxo’s China operations. Authorities alleged that Mr. Reilly, a Briton, ordered his sales team and other employees to bribe hospital doctors, health-care organizations and other parties on “a large scale” to boost drug sales in China.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com .Europe studying Abenomics lessons from JapanStephen: Hong Kong’s China debt trap10 biggest S&P 500 winners and losers for 2014	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=103E33A2-0019-11E4-B2B1-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-30

Japan industrial output rebounds but misses forecast	LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Japans industrial output snapped back in May from a slump in April, data out Monday showed, though the bounce wasnt quite as bouncy as economists had expected. Industrial production rose 0.5% last month, with the notoriously volatile data set swinging from a 2.8% drop the previous month. However, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.9% gain. Transport equipment (including cars) led the gain, followed by textiles and electronics. Perhaps just as important was a rebound in expectations among Japans top manufacturers. In a survey included with each months data, the executives tipped Junes industrial output to show a 0.7% pullback, much better than the expected 2% June drop the survey showed last month. For July, the survey predicts a return to growth, to the tune of 1.5%. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen strengthened slightly after the data, with the dollar /quotes/zigman/4868099/realtime/sampled USDJPY -0.1202% slipping to ¥101.44 from ¥101.46 a minute before the release.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=2D36D01E-B91E-4E44-AF35-2793C9BFCDAD&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-29

Utilities, airlines seen at risk in second half of year	By Wallace Witkowski, MarketWatchAt end of the last full week of trading in the first-half of 2014, the S&P 500 Index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.55%  is up 6.1% for the year, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.54%  up 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP +0.63%  up 5.3%.Airline, pharmaceutical, and utilities stocks were the big winners in the first half of 2014; a period marred by bad weather, a drop in first-quarter GDP, and a drop in Treasury yields.Of those three, pharma stocks are expected to hold firm given a recent wave of mergers and acquisition activity, said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. Airlines and utilities face a more uncertain future.Utilities and real-estate investment trusts are getting action because they are bond proxies for the most part, Belski said. Investors, surprised that the yield on the 10-year Treasury /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR 0.00%  dropped below 3%, rushed toward these sectors in search of yield, he said.“We’re underweight on utilities because they’re the most expensive,” Belski said. “If and when the economy improves they’re going to be at risk.”All it will take is a steady upward trend in 10-year Treasury yields to start loosening money out of those defensive plays, said John Canally, investment strategist and economist at LPL Financial. Momentum in utilities, in particular, picked up as 10-year yields dropped from 3% in January. A return to 3% will turn the bulk of that money back into cyclical stocks, he said.As a whole, the consumer discretionary sector is the worst performing of the 10 broad S&P 500 sectors for the year. It has seen some marginal improvement recently, rising about 1% on the week following improvements in consumer sentiment and consumer spending.Canally believes some of the burden on brick and mortar retailers may be from higher energy prices, with more consumers content to do their ordering online. Right now, he sees a disconnect between consumer stocks and consumers. First-quarter GDP numbers would have us believe the consumer is horrendously overburdened, but mostly the opposite is true with consumer debt burdens lower and improved employment prospects, he said.Even so, it’s still unclear whether retail stocks will recover much. LPL Financial pointed out in a recent note that retail sales jumped in late April and early May, citing International Council of Shopping Centers figures. But Belski said that retailers still have structural issues they need to overcome.Stocks that have hung like a millstone around the neck of the retail sector this year include Staples Inc. /quotes/zigman/78299/delayed/quotes/nls/spls SPLS +1.81%  , Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. /quotes/zigman/68991/delayed/quotes/nls/bbby BBBY +2.68%  , Best Buy Co. /quotes/zigman/219712/delayed/quotes/nls/bby BBY +2.10%  , all with share-price losses of more than 20% on the year. In the multiline retail space, shares of Target Corp. /quotes/zigman/253872/delayed/quotes/nls/tgt TGT +1.26%  have been particularly weak with an 8% decline on the year.Airlines, part of the industrials sector, have had a particularly high-flying year as the best performing subsector on the S&P 500. While that 43% rally includes just S&P 500 components Delta Air Lines Inc. /quotes/zigman/463579/delayed/quotes/nls/dal DAL +0.94%  and Southwest Airlines Co. /quotes/zigman/241463/delayed/quotes/nls/luv LUV +0.87%  , other non-S&P 500 airlines have rallied as well. Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/24849617/delayed/quotes/nls/aal AAL -0.79%  are up 75% for the year. Shares of JetBlue Airways Corp. /quotes/zigman/87304/delayed/quotes/nls/jblu JBLU +1.30%  have gained 26%. And United Continental Hioldings Inc. /quotes/zigman/617037/delayed/quotes/nls/ual UAL +1.55%  is up 9%.That’s not sustainable according to Belski. Much of the run-up in airlines has come from reduced capacity, more efficient cost structures, and more revenue from fees on bags and cabin services. As the economy improves, he argues, airlines are going to be forced to increase capacity, putting pressure on seat prices, and in turn, stock prices.Higher energy prices could also derail the rally in airline stocks, Canally said. But, at the same time, airline activity could also hint at more capital spending in the works implied by increased business travel to make deals. Also, higher prices and fees haven’t deterred non-business travelers.Capital expenditure spending is still a key to jump starting industrials and adding to tech company gains, Belski said. Many investors still don’t believe that a return to large capital expenditure is likely, and that’s holding industrials back.That’s been a strike against the largest component of the industrial conglomerates subsector, General Electric Co. /quotes/zigman/227468/delayed/quotes/nls/ge GE +0.94% , with shares down 5.7% for the year.With respect to industrials, many investors have been focused on the sector’s exposure to emerging markets and not on North American economic expansion, Belski said. When you look at earnings, however, it’s those companies with more north American exposure that have better earnings outlooks and more attractive valuations, he said.Canally also noted that durable goods spending will likely improve from the first half, and have already started turning around as core capital goods shipments expanded, while commercial and industrial loans have picked up recently.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Why stock volume’s going to go crazy at the closeHow one couple wiped out a $125,000 debt10 things Generation X won’t tell you	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B2A5635A-FE10-11E3-B93C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-29

BlackRock receives Wells notice from SEC	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- BlackRock Advisors has received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was revealed in an 8k filing on Friday. The Wells notice was sent after the SEC staff decided to recommend action against the company, as first reported by Bloomberg. BlackRock announced that the portfolio manager in question, Daniel J. Rice III, no longer works for the companys energy and resources portfolio. Rice retired from the worlds biggest asset manager in 2012 to address any perception of a potential conflict of interest as a result of his personal investments and involvement in a family business, Rice Energy LP and related entities, according to the filing. No improper trading happened within the portfolios that Rice managed, BlackRock said. BlackRock has been cooperating with the SEC on the investigation into the matter. On June 17, BlackRock received a Wells notice indicating the SEC staff had taken the preliminary view the asset managers disclosures related to the situation, and its policies and procedures, were inadequate, according to the filing. The company stated it does not expect any resolution of the matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial results or operations.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F735496F-4C3B-4AE8-9EED-987DBB5375D9&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

Bebe to cut jobs, exit its money-losing 2b business	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Money-losing Bebe Stores Inc. /quotes/zigman/70419/delayed/quotes/nls/bebe BEBE -0.32% said on Monday that it plans to exit its 2b business, which sells a cheaper clothing assortment for women compared to its namesake chain, to focus on its core apparel brand and cut costs. Its expected to record pretax charges of about $5 million to $6 million to close the remaining 16 2b mall stores and write off or liquidate inventory. Bebe also plans to cut about 9% of its nonstore employees, excluding the distribution center, and less than 1% of its store operations team. The company sees fourth-quarter comparable sales to decline in the low single digit percentage range. It still forecast per-share loss in the mid-teen range. Bebe was flat in after-hours trading. It has lost more than two-fifths of its value the past year.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B3477C32-3E55-4594-8027-1E7AE5BE545C&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

5 ways to protect yourself from credit-card fraud	By Priya Anand, MarketWatchThe U.S. ties with India as the country with the third-highest card fraud rate over the last five years, behind China at 42% and the United Arab Emirates at 44%, according to the study by the payments company ACI Worldwide and Aite Group, a research firm.The U.S. is the last developed country to adopt technology to store card data on a microchip rather than the magnetic stripe, with a goal of fully migrating to the system by October 2015. The chip-and-pin card system — also known as also called EMV, which stands for Europay, MasterCard /quotes/zigman/390906/delayed/quotes/nls/ma MA +0.71%  and Visa /quotes/zigman/502306/delayed/quotes/nls/v V +0.78%  , the companies that began developing it in 1994 — is considered more fraud-resistant.Data breaches — and the card fraud that could follow — have hit a nerve for millions of consumers in recent months. Target Corp.’s /quotes/zigman/253872/delayed/quotes/nls/tgt TGT +1.26%   bombshell holiday-season compromise late last year put up to 110 million customers’ information at risk and marked the start of seemingly unending headlines about similar leaks or hacks at other companies. P.F. Chang’s China Bistro said earlier this month that an unknown number of credit and debit cards used at the chain’s more than 200 restaurants were part of a “security compromise,” and it didn’t know which ones.“I wonder whether or not people are becoming a little bit numb,” says Michael Grillo, senior product marketing manager at ACI, who adds that he’s surprised people still do things the report outlined as “risky behaviors.” The study found that 50% of people who engaged in those activities were victims of card fraud, compared with the 38% of people who did not but still experienced fraud.Using credit and debit cards less — like the Swedes and Dutch, who each saw fraud rates lower than 15% — is one way to reduce risk, given that fraud can happen even to those who use their cards responsibly, as evidenced by the breaches. But people aren’t powerless.1. Leaving a smartphone unlocked while not using it.11% of Americans leave their smartphones unlocked while not using them, compared with 33% of people in Mexico, putting information stored on the phone at risk.2. Throwing away papers with bank account numbers on them.Paperwork with personal information should hit the shredder before the trash. The study found that 13% of people in the U.S. toss documents with account numbers on them in the garbage.3. Using a public or unsecure computer for banking or online shopping.It seems obvious, but 7% of people in the U.S. shop or bank online from public computers or machines that don’t have security software.4. Replying to emails or calls requesting your banking details.In Brazil, 7% of people still give their information away over the phone or email, compared with 5% in the U.S., according to the study.5. Carrying around a note with a PIN number written on it.That sticky note that 6% of U.S. consumers carry around with them can easily slip into the wrong hands.Also see:How to spot credit-card skimmersSam’s Club joins race for a fraud-fighting credit card10 things scammers won’t tell you	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B35C177E-FBEC-11E3-AE23-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

Time to call out the (oil) reserves?	By Daniel GoldsteinThe first time the U.S. made a 911 call to the SPR was in January 1991 at the start of Operation Desert Storm. The second time came in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina damaged much of the Gulf Coast’s oil refining and production capacity. The most recent event came in 2011 with the U.S.-led attack on Libya. And if much of Iraq’s 3-million barrel a day of oil production goes offline because of the current Sunni and Shiite fighting around the county’s oilfields, the SPR may just get its fourth emergency call in its history.The reserve currently holds about 691 million barrels of oil, according to the Department of Energy’s website, which is near its full capacity of 727 million barrels. Of the reserve, 262 million barrels are lower-sulfur “sweet” crude, which is easily refined into gasoline, and 430 million barrels of higher-sulfur “sour” crude, which is more difficult to refine. A single 42-gallon barrel of oil is typically refined into about 20 gallons of gasoline, 11 gallons of diesel and 4 gallons of jet fuel along with other refined products.The U.S. produced about 7.4 million barrels of crude oil a day in 2013, up from about 5 million barrels a day in 2008 and the most since 1990, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At its peak in 1970, the U.S. produced more than 9.6 million barrels a day.The reserve, which was initiated by President Jimmy Carter in August 1980, is designed to protect the U.S. against a total loss of imported oil, particularly by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. Two months after the September 11th attacks, President George W. Bush ordered the Strategic Petroleum Reserve filled to its capacity of 700 million barrels. At the time of the order, the SPR contained about 545 million barrels. The reserve was filled by August 2005.But the violence in Iraq is starting to worry some oil analysts who could see a supply crunch coming if the fighting spreads to southern Iraq where most oil production is located.“Iraq has already substantially grown oil production in recent years, but most important to global energy markets is the country’s ability to achieve expected supply growth in the coming years. Iraq is expected to account for 61 percent of OPEC supply growth by 2018,” said Patrick Hughes, an analyst with Height Analytics in Washington D.C. He said the International Energy Agency (the U.S.-led organization that was created in 1974 in response to the Arab OPEC embargo) has already dropped its Iraq supply projections by 500,000 barrels a day due to what they called the country’s “precarious political and security situation.” In the near term, Hughes said the southern city of Basra remains his main energy concern. “Regardless of whether Basra is directly affected, however, medium- and long-term Iraqi supply could be substantially hindered by sustained sectarian conflict and protracted instability that curtails major energy sector investments,” he said.Even if all imported oil was cut off, including the unlikely event that allies like Canada and Mexico, which supply the U.S. with about 3 million barrels of oil a day, couldn’t, or wouldn’t supply oil to the United States, the SPR gives the U.S. a cushion of more than 90 days’ worth of supply to keep the U.S. economy running until supplies can be restored. Back in 2005, Congress had planned to expand the reserve to 1 billion barrels but changed its mind in 2011.The good news is that in the history of the reserve, the U.S. has never had to draw on more than a fraction of the reserve’s total capacity. The biggest release came in 2011 with 30 million barrels, in coordination with the IEA and its members, which include Japan, Germany and Italy, who released just under another 30 million barrels when the U.S., Britain and France launched air strikes against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.From the moment a U.S. President orders a release from the SPR, the reserve can draw down its capacity at a rate of 4.4 million barrels a day for three straight months, which coincidently (or not) is just over the exact same amount of oil a day the U.S. imports from OPEC countries (3.7 million) and twice what the U.S. imports per day from Persian Gulf states (2 million barrels a day). The location of the reserves is key, with two facilities in Texas and two in Louisiana, as they are interconnected with industry refineries and tanker platforms that can receive the oil straightaway.Still, it would take 13 days from a decision by the president to enter the U.S. market. All told, the U.S. imports about 9.8 million barrels of oil a day from more than 80 countries, but also ships out about 3.8 million barrels a day in exports, mainly in refined products. For what it’s worth, in 2013, U.S. consumers also filled their tanks with 368 million gallons of gas (about 8.8 million barrels worth) every day.In addition to the SPR, the U.S. has a 1 million barrel reserve of heating oil, which was used for the first time in November 2012 after Hurricane Sandy struck the Northeast, where more than 80% of the 6.9 million households that rely on heating oil reside.This story has been updated from the original version.Also see:What the Iraq crisis means for youWhy high gas prices mean high beef prices	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0FDFD670-F81E-11E3-9D9C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

Red flags for economy appear	By Thomas H. Kee Jr.In this specific observation Im going to talk about demand.According to my observations there are two parts to the demand side of the equation in modern economics. The first part is natural, based on the investment patterns of individuals in our economy. The second part of the demand side comes from government action, specifically those actions of the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve. All of these play a role in this observation.Notwithstanding intervention by the government, the economy would grow based on the natural investment cycles of individuals. Spending patterns act like chaos-like boundaries around longer-term investment cycles. This has been true for over 100 years, and I have already proven that longer-term investment cycles define longer-term economic cycles between 1900 and now.That makes the natural-demand side of this equation extremely important, but when fabricated demand, like the injections we have seen over the past handful of years from the Federal reserve, influence excess liquidity, it serves to offset the natural growth rates that would otherwise exist. This is extremely important to incorporate into our model.To measure naturalized growth rates, I use my tool called The Investment Rate, which is a measure of the rate of change in the amount of new money available to be invested into the U.S. economy on an annualized basis over long-term periods of time. It starts in 1900 and extends beyond 2030. This observation provides a picture of the natural growth rate assuming that growth depends on new money.My thesis suggests that we cannot churn the old money and expect to realize growth, but new money must be there instead for growth rates to be realized. That means that new money is the catalyst for economic growth over time.According to the Investment Rate, the rate of change in the amount of new money available to be invested in the United States on a naturalized basis has been declining since 2007, and it will continue to decline for many years to come. We are in the third major down period in U.S. history according to this observation, and for that reason, it is just like the Great Depression and Stagflation periods.However, at the same time this naturalized growth rate has been declining, the Federal Reserve has been infusing tremendous amounts of unnatural liquidity into the system (recent years). In doing so, it has completely offset the otherwise weak conditions that would naturally occur.The infusions of capital were massive, and they served to prevent a Greater Depression so far, but if the thesis of new money holds, and new money is required to realize continued growth, then the Federal Reserve cannot stop infusing capital into the economy, or economic growth will deteriorate.The combined efforts of the U.S. Treasury Department and Federal Reserve infused capital at a rate of $20 billion per month during 2013. This combined effort offsets the capital infusions by the FOMC by the additional bond sales of the U.S. Treasury department providing a definition of net-real stimulus (NRS) that can be used to evaluate excess liquidity levels.Since the Federal Reserve has begun to taper, not only has NRS reverted to zero, but effectively it is now minus $20 billion per month, too (see chart), completely offsetting the monthly NRS that occurred in 2013.This is a serious risk for two reasons.First, the capital infusions have increased the economy to an unnatural level, and that means it is much more difficult to sustain. If new money is required to grow based on natural economic conditions, more new money will be required to grow from the unnatural levels that were at today.Second, without additional NRS, the economy will be left to grow at its naturalized state. As defined by the Investment Rate, it is currently deteriorating every year. That makes it much more difficult to grow, and in the past, conditions like this were met with severe economic recession.In addition, if tapering continues, not only will NRS completely offset the monthly stimulus from 2013, but it will eventually drain capital from the financial system at a much faster pace, speeding up the reversion of our economy to its more naturalized state, and probably causing an undershoot to occur.Evidence of this is already clear from GDP figures. We know that some of the weakness was caused by weather-related conditions, but the decline in net real investment is a clear signal that economic conditions are changing and the macroeconomic environment is riddled with red flags.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=20C2CCE3-882F-4643-9997-89CDE460BC4C&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27
Oil down a second week as Iraq fear premium fades	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchOn the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.28%  fell 10 cents, or 0.1%, to settle at $105.74 a barrel. Tracking the most-active contracts, oil saw a 1% weekly decline, its second in a row.August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -0.38%  on the ICE Futures exchange rose 9 cents, or 0.1%, to end at $113.30 a barrel.“The oil market appears to be gradually pricing out the fear premium associated with Iraq again,” wrote Eugen Weinberg, head of commodity research at Commerzbank, in a note. Brent has pulled back from a nine-month high set last week above $115 a barrel as investors become “convinced that the fighting in the north of Iraq will have no impact on the oil supply in the south.”Iraq exports around 2.5 million barrels of oil a day. Export-oriented facilities are concentrated in the Shia-dominated south and investors appear increasingly confident those areas will remain insulated from the Sunni-led insurgency in the north of the country. The violence, however, is expected to curtail Iraq’s efforts to significantly boost oil production in the years ahead.The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria rebel group has not attacked Baghdad, “raising hopes that the record oil production and exports from the south will continue,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, noting that with the weekend ahead, he didn’t expect traders to aggressively “brace the short side.”Oil was pressured earlier this week as data showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose last week after posting declines over the previous three weeks.On Friday, data showing a rise in June consumer sentiment failed to provide much support for oil prices. Platts also reported that May China oil demand fell to its lowest level in nine months.On Nymex Friday, August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 -0.86% fell 3 cents, or 0.7%, to $4.41 per million British thermal units on its first full day as a front-month contract. The contract lost 3.1% for the week, but tracking the most-active contracts, futures prices were down roughly 2.7% on the week.July gasoline  rose a cent to $3.10 a gallon, but was down 0.9% for the week, while July heating oil  settled at $3 a gallon, down almost 2 cents for the session to lose 1.8% for the week. The July contracts will expire at the Nymex close on Monday.Why silver’s outperforming and gold isn’t done yetHow one couple wiped out a $125,000 debtHow the Clintons went from ‘deal broke’ to rich	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=331BD952-FDF2-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

Big money arrival means more plays for speculators	By Kevin MarderFor a larger chart, please click here .Chart created using TradeStation . ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2014. All rights reserved.Volatility, after being so muted, picked up slightly this week from levels rarely seen in a decade, to no ones surprise. Volatility mean-reverts, often overshooting as it goes from one extreme back toward its average.Tuesdays turbulence in the averages occurred on a gaping outside-day reversal. This may have been a reaction to the previous Fridays quarterly, quadruple-witching day, an actively traded session in which certain futures and options contracts expire. When there is a trend heading into a witching session, the market tends to reverse that trend shortly thereafter. This has occurred in 10 of the last 13 instances in which there was a reasonable trend.Short-term, the rally has narrowed somewhat. This can be seen in the chart below of the S&P 500 plotted with a proxy for the average stock, the number of 52-week highs on the New York Stock Exchange. This is very short-term stuff, and not too much should be made of it.For a larger chart, please click here .Chart created using TradeStation . ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2014.

10-year Treasury scores first weekly gain in four	By Saumya Vaishampayan, MarketWatchThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR 0.00% , which falls as the price rises, was flat at 2.531%. The yield fell to a four-week low Thursday after a weak auction of seven-year notes. It finished last week at 2.61%.The 30-year Treasury bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR 0.00%  yield inched up one basis point to 3.363%, according to FactSet data.“It is extremely sluggish out,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. “With the major market event of June having passed last week, things are just a little bit quieter,” he said, referring to the Federal Reserve’s June meeting.The steeper-than-expected contraction in the U.S. economy during the first quarter, which was reported Wednesday, could add conviction to the argument that the Federal Reserve will keep policy accommodative for a while after its stimulative bond purchases come to an end this year.While the first-quarter GDP report was backwards looking — the second quarter ends next week — it still “seems to have implications about the long-term health of the U.S. economy,” said LeBas. That sparked some of this week’s buying of Treasurys, he added.“We’re going to linger near current rate levels until we get a better bead on Q3 growth in the U.S. This is when we should get a better sense of the true run rate of the U.S. economy with numbers that will be presumably free of the weather distortions that made for such a bumpy ride in the first half of this year,” William O’Donnell and Gabriel Mann of RBS said in a note.On Friday, the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters consumer sentiment gauge rose to a final June reading of 82.5 from 81.9 in May.The yield on the five-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR 0.00%  fell 1 basis point to 1.636% and the seven-year note /quotes/zigman/4868264/delayed 7_YEAR 0.00%  yield was flat at 2.137%.6 reasons why stocks are still setting recordsWhy silver’s outperforming gold and isn’t done yet10 everyday things getting slammed by inflation	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7A08F26C-FE03-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

Gold futures tally fourth weekly gain in a row	By Myra P. Saefong and Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatchGold for August delivery /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.05%  added $3, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,320 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. For the week, prices were up around 0.3% — adding to 5.5% climb scored over the previous three weeks.July silver /quotes/zigman/698627/delayed SIN4 +0.34%  fell 3 cents, or 0.2%, to settle at $21.08 an ounce, trading around 0.6% higher for the week. September silver /quotes/zigman/12294966/delayed SIU4 +0.30% , which is now the most actively traded contract, ended almost 3 cents lower at $21.13 an ounce. Read Commodities Corner: Why silver is outperforming gold.Gold spent the week primarily “digesting the big gains” made after Federal Reserve Chief Janet Yellen’s “dovish” comments last Thursday, said Vedant Mimani, lead portfolio manager of the Atyant Capital Global Opportunities Fund. Gold futures climbed 3.3% last week. “From a technical perspective, $1,320-$1,350 marks a zone of heavy resistance,” said Mimani.On the geopolitical front on Friday, the European Union and three of Russia’s neighbors signed big trade-and-political deals, with The Wall Street Journal saying that could potentially provoke fresh tensions with Moscow .In U.S. economic news, data showed that U.S. consumer sentiment rose to a final June reading of 82.5. Economists polled by MarketWatch expected a reading of 81.9.“With the economic data continuing to support the idea that the U.S. economy is in recovery, investors show little interest in safe haven assets such as gold, and instead allocate to the traditional stocks and bonds,” said Mimani.In other metals trading, July platinum /quotes/zigman/15256884/delayed PLN4 -0.19% rose $8.40, or 0.6%, to end at $1,478.50 an ounce, climbing around 1.5% for the week, while October platinum /quotes/zigman/19534176/delayed PLV4 -0.34% , now the most-active contract, settled at $1,480.30, up $9, or 0.6%.September palladium /quotes/zigman/18010104/delayed PAU4 +0.37%  added $7.05, or 0.8%, to $842.85 an ounce, up around 2.5% on the week.High-grade copper for July delivery /quotes/zigman/678460/delayed HGN4 -0.21%  closed down almost 2 cents at $3.15 a pound, up about 0.9% from a week ago.

Parking app fuels more rage in San Francisco	By David Weidner, MarketWatchInstead, MonkeyParking has become the latest flash point in the growing conflict between mobile technology’s ability to make life easier (and costlier) and an establishment that sees such apps as a way to circumvent the rules.City Attorney Dennis Herrera on Monday sent a cease-and-desist letter to MonkeyParking’s developers and a request to Apple Inc.’s /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +0.59%  general counsel asking that the company remove the app from its store. Two other apps that provide a similar service are being targeted by Herrera’s office: Sweetch and the yet-to-be-launched ParkModo, which pays drivers to hold parking spaces and then sells them.“Technology has given rise to many laudable innovations in how we live and work — and Monkey Parking is not one of them,” Herrera said.Apple officials did not respond to requests for comment.Paulo Dobrowolny, chief executive and co-founder of Rome-base MonkeyParking, disputed the assertion that his service wasn’t beneficial. MonkeyParking lawyers issued a statement Thursday asserting that the app was being unfairly targeted.“A new company providing value to people should be regulated and not banned,” Dobrowolny said. “This applies also to companies like Airbnb, Uber and Lyft that are continuously facing difficulties while delivering something that makes users happy. Regulation is fundamental in driving innovation, while banning is just stopping it.”The city says selling parking spaces violates a law banning the buying and selling of public resources. And to some in a city tense about the distribution of wealth among its residents, MonkeyParking reflects how the city’s tech riches have distorted the marketplace. The message seems to be, if you can’t afford to rent or park here, try Oakland.The city, under Mayor Ed Lee, might seem as if it’s protecting motorists’ rights in its efforts to curb auction parking. But it also could be accused of sending mixed messages. Parking rates rose last year, as did the price of a ticket — already the highest among major U.S. cities — to $74 from $72 in the most sought-after zones.Also, there is a city-wide crackdown on motorists that led some to call 2014 “The Year of the Citation.” In April, an 86-year-old man was hit by a car and admitted to the hospital. Police gave him a visit — and a jaywalking ticket. (It was later rescinded.)There is also the continuing controversy over corporate shuttles, most notably the G bus. The Municipal Transit Agency is employing an 18-month trial that will allow Google Inc.’s /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%  fleet of gleaming white luxury buses to use Muni stops. As part of the trial, which is set to begin in August, some parking spaces will be removed to make room.The city, it seems, is trying to balance the needs of a tech industry that has created a renaissance in its boundaries and preserve its fundamental values. The tech industry, hell-bent on making money through “disruptive” new products, is encroaching on everything from home rentals to, now, parking spaces. And if you think this is a San Francisco issue only, consider that Detroit is considering privatizing its water system and whether you’d pay a few bucks to get a parking space when you’re late for your kid’s cello recital.As MonkeyParking lawyers put it, the city’s effort to shut down the app “is yet another example of a local ordinance that was drafted in a world pre-shared economy which local authorities are improperly applying to a shared-economy service.”The uneasy relationship between technology and the public interest isn’t lost on city officials. John Avalos, a member of the Board of Supervisors, said the tech industry and public officials need to collaborate more.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=63C90FE4-FDFB-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

Be wary of ‘new and improved’ mutual funds	By Chuck Jaffe, MarketWatchThere are new mutual funds that are built to ease whatever is troubling your mind — and your portfolio — by mitigating risk, reducing volatility, enhancing return and more.They’re not making fantastic or outrageous claims that violate the law, but they are working hard to attract zealous followers — financial advisers mostly — who will then sell you on how these new issues will help to cure your financial ills.Of course, ideas like “smart-beta funds,” “multi-strategy alternative funds,” low-volatility funds, managed futures funds, market-neutral or long/short funds and more are not financial quackery. The strategies behind each of these ideas have merit; I have no doubt that if used properly, they can diversify a portfolio precisely as advertised.But if you are a typical investor, the question is whether they have merit for you.It’s a bit like high-level power tools. In the hands of a skilled worker or carpenter, they make the job easier, faster, more predictable and likely to be finished as expected and imagined. In the hands of a wannabe or a wishful thinker, they could work, could cause frustrations that botch the job, or maybe even lead to a trip to the emergency room.The folks behind these new products don’t really deny this. They will tell you that their sophisticated ideas wind up creating the power tools that savvy financial advisers use. If you’re an average investor, you’re not going on this ride unsupervised; your trip is chaperoned by the adviser so you aren’t misusing the product.But increasingly, these kinds of alternatives are winding up in retirement plans, and while the plan sponsor may understand the benefits, proper uses and potential dangers of these things, the average worker doesn’t. They have a difficult enough time making plain-vanilla funds work — studies show that investors routinely buy their funds high after a run of strong performance and sell them low when there has been a pullback — let alone something they barely understand.Moreover, while these solutions are always pitched as being good for investors, the people for whom they are always good are the pitchers, the brokers and planners pushing them.While it is appropriate, given the investment’s complexity, that these products are sold by brokers and advisers, it’s important to remember that most of those counselors are permanently on the lookout for something new to attract and retain clients. Thus, the fund industry is under constant pressure to develop new products and services — often just twists and variations of old products and themes — resulting in a near-constant stream of offerings, most with little benefit to the public.I talked to a number of financial advisers who said the real key is less about what is being offered and what it can do than about how well the investor knows their own ability to create and follow a plan.If you can invest for the long haul and not touch the asset-allocation plan other than for rebalancing — no matter what is happening on the market — then a big slug of alternatives or hedge-like mutual funds isn’t necessary.If you will be freaked out by the next market burp, correction or downturn — and are likely to make hasty moves as you perceive the market to be unraveling your plans — then you want to take a more tactical approach by using some new issues to cut risk and/or volatility.Of course, the problem there is that you may panic out of those funds at exactly the wrong time too.What’s more, to get the value of these funds, making them a small portion of the portfolio isn’t always smart; instead, to get the kind of results the experts say these funds can deliver, an investor might need to take a significant step in the direction of these new funds, which is a big leap of faith.“We can be very dubious about some of the new products,” said Michael Falk, chief strategist at Mauka Capital in Chicago. “That doesn’t mean they can’t help you, but what’s the marginal benefit? If you’ve got to put 20, 30, 40 or 50 percent of your assets in a certain newfangled investment for it to benefit your overall portfolio, we have to ask the question, ‘Is the average person going to do that?’“If they’re thinking because it’s new and improved and fancy and sophisticated, that they’re only going to put five to 10 percent in — if it’s not going to make a marginal contribution to the portfolio – then … why bother?”Of course, the advisory community has reasons to bother with the new products, but make sure they’re not just pushing a bill of goods — something that seems great today that they will be encouraging you to replace with another “current” product months or years down the line.Examine their history when it comes to appealing to your sense of adventure or your willingness to try the next big thing. Taking a chance on these new ideas is fine, but don’t make a habit of it without seeing some results.Adding complexity to a fund adds to costs and changes the risk profile of a portfolio. It increases the likelihood of future mistakes.The fund industry was started to give investors diversification and professional management at a reasonable price, and plenty of issues still do that. When looking at a fund that does not provde those basic characteristics – because it is supposed to be giving you something much more complicated and important – question whether it’s worth the adventure.But don’t expect that today’s new fund classes or the catch-all of “alternative investments” is a panacea for your portfolio. It’s more like an option that you can take, but which may not deliver results that equal the hype.More from MarketWatch:How one couple wiped out a $125,000 debt6 tricks for making the best retirement decisions10 things Generation X won’t tell you	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=EF0B817E-FE1C-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

U.K. stocks higher, but weekly loss intact	By Carla Mozee, MarketWatchThe FTSE 100 index /quotes/zigman/3173262/delayed UK:UKX +0.01% rose 0.3% to 6,757.77, but ended the week with a loss of 1%.Friday’s advance was led by a 3.5% rise for TUI Travel PLC /quotes/zigman/458410/delayed UK:TT -0.85%  after the travel group said it will merge with TUI AG, its German majority shareholder, in an all-share merger.Shares of home builder Barratt Developments PLC /quotes/zigman/152374/delayed UK:BDEV -1.22% rose 3.2% and Persimmon PLC /quotes/zigman/155560/delayed UK:PSN -0.84%  gained 1.5% after UBS retained its positive view on the home-construction sector despite policy concerns.Housing stocks moved higher Thursday after the Bank of England outlined measures aimed at cooling the U.K.’s housing boom. The “recommendations to limit high loan-to-income lending and impose more stringent affordability stress-testing was a sensible, but relatively mild initial step to curb potential future excesses in the housing market,” said UBS analysts.But an improving U.K. economy, historically low costs of mortgage financing and political support for new construction are still in the housing sector’s favor, they said.Off the benchmark, housing developer Taylor Wimpey PLC /quotes/zigman/156565/delayed UK:TW 0.00% rose 3.6%.Also ending higher was Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC /quotes/zigman/5147552/delayed UK:RR 0.00% . The shares picked up 2.2% after a Reuters report that Airbus Group /quotes/zigman/262288/delayed FR:AIR +0.44%  is near a decision to upgrade its A330 aircraft with engines made by Rolls-Royce.Shares of Barclays PLC /quotes/zigman/301787/delayed UK:BARC -0.36% edged up 0.5%, paring heftier gains. They dropped 6.5% on Thursday to a 19-month low on U.S. legal problems. Reports said Barclays Chief Executive Antony Jenkins said in a staff memo Thursday that the bank will conduct an internal probe, following accusations of dark-pool fraud in a lawsuit filed by the New York Attorney General.U.K. stocks on Friday held to gains after the Office of National Statistics kept its estimate of first-quarter growth in gross domestic product at 0.8%, meeting expectations for the quarter-over-quarter figure. Growth on an annualized basis was reduced to 3% from 3.1%.The pound /quotes/zigman/4867886/realtime/sampled GBPUSD +0.0231%  briefly dipped following the report, but stayed around the $1.70 level. It was buying $1.702 per dollar, compared with $1.6983 late Wednesday.On Friday, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told the BBC that returning to “old normal” level of interest rates of 5% appeared unlikely in the medium term, as economic growth still faces challenges including higher levels of household debt.

Why stock volume’s going to go crazy at the close	By Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatchAbout $42 billion will trade on Friday as a result of the reconstitution, which will make it one of the biggest trading days of the year in terms of dollar volume, said a Reuters report citing Credit Suisse data.Russell adjusts its index components once a year to reflect market changes, working to ensure its indexes, most notably the large-cap Russell 1000 /quotes/zigman/2759628/delayed RUI +0.53%   and the small-cap Russell 2000 /quotes/zigman/2759624/delayed RUT +0.72%  represent what they’re intended to. The changes take effect at the end of trading Friday. Funds that track the Russell indexes must buy or sell stocks as a result, and traders bet on price moves resulting from that action.The expected boost in shares traded is coming amid a great deal of hand-wringing lately about low trading volume.So what are some highlights this year?MarketWatch spoke earlier this week with Russell Investments’ Rolf Agather and David Koenig, and they noted small caps are getting bigger. The breakpoint between large- and small-cap stocks has risen to $3.1 billion from $2.6 billion last year.That breakpoint means stocks with a market capitalization above $3.1 billion generally will go in the large-cap Russell 1000 /quotes/zigman/2759628/delayed RUI +0.53% , with those below that mark going in the small-cap Russell 2000 /quotes/zigman/2759624/delayed RUT +0.72% .The higher breakpoint reflects the stock market’s gains. In 1984, the breakpoint between the Russell 2000 and the Russell 1000 was only at the $255 million mark, Russell said in a news release.Other notable changes include companies like GrubHub /quotes/zigman/30071449/delayed/quotes/nls/grub GRUB +0.98%   and CBS Outdoor Americas /quotes/zigman/28856841/delayed/quotes/nls/cbso CBSO +0.31%  are slated to join the Russell 3000 /quotes/zigman/1652139/delayed RUA +0.55% , while others like Corinthian Colleges /quotes/zigman/54226/delayed/quotes/nls/coco COCO +5.19%   and Delphi Automotive /quotes/zigman/7310093/delayed/quotes/nls/dlph DLPH +0.50%   are leaving that index, which represents 98% of the investible U.S. stock market.For international investors, Egypt is dropping to a frontier market, down from an emerging market.You can read a rebalancing FAQ here .How one couple wiped out a $125,000 debtWhy silver’s outperforming gold and isn’t done yetAluminum, energy, health care: Where Dennis Gartman, other strategists are bullish	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=543489DA-FE07-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

Consumer sentiment brightens on current economy	By Ruth Mantell, MarketWatchThe overall sentiment gauge from the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters rose to a final June reading of 82.5 from a final May level of 81.9. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a final June level of 81.9, compared with an estimate earlier this month of 81.2. For context, the gauge averaged 86.9 over the year leading up to the recession.U.S. stocks /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.54%   held onto losses after the sentiment data.Economists watch sentiment levels to get a feeling for the direction of consumer spending. On Thursday, the government reported that consumer spending rose last month, driven by auto sales.Although consumers recently found out that the economy saw a surprisingly sharp contraction in the first quarter, they’ve been cheered by better job-market readings, according to the sentiment report. In June many consumers reported an improvement in their financial situation, though few expected their finances to improve in the coming year, the report said.“Consumers did not expect such a negative [gross domestic product] report, but it will not cause them to revise their expectations of future economic growth,” said Richard Curtin, chief economist for the consumer survey.Many households said wage growth would not push past the inflation rate.“Nearly half of all households anticipated declining living standards,” the report said.And in a sentiment-data tidbit that portends well for the housing market, a large share of respondents said rising home prices had made selling more attractive, with few expecting to lose money if they sold their home. Low inventory levels have been holding back home sales, economists say. So if more consumers are willing to put their homes on the market, more deals could close .Details of the UMich report show that a gauge of consumers’ views on current conditions rose to 96.6 in June from 94.5 in May. Meanwhile, a barometer of their expectations ticked down to 73.5 from 73.7.Six reasons why stocks are still setting recordsWhy silver is outdoing gold and isn’t done yet	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=58F5C9B4-FDFF-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

Real estate boom bill comes due	By Daniel Goldstein, MarketWatchDuring the peak of the housing boom, from 2004-07, interest-only mortgages gave some buyers access to bigger or better homes than they likely could have afforded with a traditional principal-and-interest monthly payment.The interest-only mortgage was meant for borrowers who had variable cash flow, such as independent contractors or salespeople who got large year-end bonuses. The loans attracted people who expected their income to rise over time, allowing them to handle principal payments later.But a product meant for a select few was oversold, says Mark Livingstone, president of Cornerstone First Financial, a mortgage broker in Washington, D.C. Borrowers in high-price markets who had steady incomes and could afford a principal-and-interest payment instead opted for interest-only loans. Many borrowers who put down less than 20% with these loans were told that the rising real-estate prices would cover their lack of equity.An estimated $934 billion in jumbo interest-only mortgages of all types were sold during the peak years of the housing boom, averaging about $234 billion a year, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a research group that publishes data on the mortgage industry. By comparison, just $55 billion in jumbo interest-only products were originated in 2002, and $140 billion in 2003, Inside Mortgage Finance says. (Jumbo loans exceed $417,000 in most markets, and $625,500 in high-price markets such as San Francisco and New York.)Interest-only mortgages come in various forms, including five-year and seven-year initial periods, but the 10-year type, followed by a reset, was popular when the housing market was hot. Now with those loans starting to enter the principal-payment period, borrowers face a dilemma: They can refinance or take their chances on a new, possibly higher, payment. When the payment resets, the principal typically must be paid back over the remaining 20-year life of the loan, instead of over 30 years, says Mr. Livingstone.Moreover, borrowers with adjustable 10-year interest-only mortgages will see their rate start to “float” from year-to-year. They could save money in the short term with current rates, but could be vulnerable to rate increases.Mr. Livingstone knows this situation firsthand. He purchased an investment property in Odenton, Md., with the help of a 10-year interest-only, nonjumbo loan with a fixed rate. The monthly payment recently shot up to $2,424 from $1,463 with the start of principal payments. He plans to list the property this month because the rental price won’t cover the cost of the new payment.Despite low rates, refinancing won’t be as easy. For one, many banks now require jumbo borrowers to have at least 20% equity in the property.Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, which tracks mortgage rates, says most jumbo-loan borrowers already have anticipated the reset and have refinanced, or can handle the higher payments because they likely have the cash flow.For jumbo-loan borrowers facing a reset, here are things to consider:	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=088E5824-FD73-11E3-B93C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

The latest in flavored vodka: Grey Goose Le Melon	By Charles Passy, MarketWatchThe back story: Not that long ago, vodka was pretty much deemed a poor man’s booze. And it was only considered worthwhile if it came from places where burly men (and maybe a few burly women) depended on it to survive long and brutal winters. Grey Goose, a French-made vodka that was the brainchild of legendary spirits entrepreneur Sidney Frank, changed the game almost from the moment it appeared on liquor store shelves in the mid ‘90s. It was elegant in its country of origin, its name and its price (almost double the cost of the most-expensive vodka on the market at the time). And sure enough, it fit perfectly within the money-is-no-object culture that defined the dot-com era. By 2004, Frank sold the brand to Bacardi for a cool $2.2 billion.And since then? Grey Goose has remained a fixture on store shelves (and on back bars), but it has also faced growing competition from brands at all price points (and with all sorts of their own back stories). Consider that Grey Goose’s sales in 2013 were flat at 3.8 million cases while category leader Smirnoff’s sales grew by 4% to 25.8 million cases, according to The Spirits Business . That has seemingly led to all sorts of re-evaluation of the brand: A new marketing campaign has put the spotlight on Grey Goose’s creator — no, not Sidney Frank, but one Francois Thibault, a Cognac maker who worked hand in hand with Frank back in the ‘90s and remains active to this day with Grey Goose, emphasizing what the brand says are the same quality ingredients (Grey Goose is made using a French wheat) and processes that defined the vodka from the start. Says brand director Lyle Tick: “The (vodka) category is fragmenting and we wanted to make sure the world knew our story and why we are Grey Goose.”Against this backdrop Grey Goose has released a new flavored product — something of a rarity for the brand (there have been just a handful of Grey Goose expressions created to date). The source of inspiration was France once again — in this case, a cantaloupe-like melon, the Cavaillon, grown in the Provence region (it’s said to have been a favorite of French kings and of such French artistic figures as Cezanne and Dumas). The Grey Goose team touts how it uses all natural flavors — straight from the melon flesh, in other words.What we think about it: Le Melon delivers plenty of melon — at least on the nose. The scent is like slicing through the ripest of cantaloupes (or better yet, swimming in some psychedelic sea full of them). Taste-wise, the flavor is more subdued — perhaps somewhat disappointingly so if you wanted to maintain that melon sensory overload. But it lingers on the tongue in a sweetly tropical way. In all, a smart addition to the Grey Goose lineup.How to enjoy it: Sure, you can make plenty of melon-inspired cocktails with Le Melon. (The Grey Goose folks suggest a Melon Mule with ginger beer and lime.) But if you want to experience that burst of melon, try this at least once by itself — with ice or chilled in the bottle.More from MarketWatch:Camel’s milk is the new superfood10 things you don’t know about the World CupHow I learned to stop worrying and love robot stocks	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9CD82F74-FD77-11E3-B93C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

Ukraine cease-fire may end if discussions fall apart	By Lukas I. AlpertRussian President Vladimir Putin repeated his call for Ukraine to prolong its weeklong cease-fire. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who is pushing a peace plan, has warned it would be difficult to continue if the militants in eastern Ukraine were unwilling to make any concessions.“The Ukrainians need to return to the path of peace, dialogue and reconciliation. What counts most today is to secure a long-term cease-fire as a necessary condition for holding in-depth talks,” Putin said.Rebels said they would join the Ukrainian government’s cease-fire on Monday, but the results have been shaky, with both sides accusing the other of instigating continuing violence. Ukraine’s government has said its army is only shooting back when attacked during the cease-fire, but warned that if talks failed there would be a tougher response.The separatists “have a few more hours to accept the president’s peace plan,” Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said. “Otherwise we will respond appropriately and with strength.”On Thursday, the rebels announced their intention to meet Friday with government representatives to try to negotiate. The meeting was reported to be scheduled for 3 p.m. local time (1200 GMT) in the largely rebel-held regional capital of Donetsk.An extended version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More from MarketWatch:Forget stock chatter, pay attention to Treasury yieldsGoPro doesn’t disappoint in public debutMajor brokers jump out of Barclays dark pool	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F1AE0CEA-FDEE-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27
You can build your own Aereo — at a cost	By Jeffry Bartash, MarketWatchThe genius of Aereo was that it allowed viewers to watch live or recorded TV from major over-the-air networks such as ABC and Fox, with minimal fuss or cost ($8 a month). Viewers could watch their favorite shows on computers, iPads or smart phones wherever they went.A few other options do exist. The problem is, they require sometimes sizable upfront costs, a fair amount of tech know-how — and a bit of patience to set up.One of the most promising bets is a device from a new company called Simple.TV . Attach a small box to your home-network router, add a digital over-the-air antenna ($20 and up) and install the software on your PC. That will allow you to watch over-the-air shows such as NCIS or The Good Wife on your computer, laptop or other mobile devices.Users can even add a separate drive ($60 and up for 500 gigabytes) to store shows for later use and have DVR-type functions.Cost: $250 for the device and a one-year subscription. Or $350 for a box and lifetime subscription. That’s just slightly more than what a three-year subscription to Aereo would have cost.A more elegant, but expensive, solution is the TiVo Roamio .TiVo /quotes/zigman/80728/delayed/quotes/nls/tivo TIVO -0.23%  , the king of DVR technology, sells an “entry” level Roamio that has a built-in HDTV over-the-air tuner and it can store hours of video. The Roamio ($170) is easy to set up and use, but to send TV programs to your phone or iPad, you’ll also have to buy the TiVo Stream ($125) accessory.If $300 worth of hardware isn’t enough, viewers would also have to buy a “lifetime” subscription that costs a whopping $500 (there is a $15 monthly subscription option as well).Another possibility is a Slingbox such as the Slingbox Pro-HD ($170). The older model, unlike newer ones, has a built-in over-the-air antenna. Connect it to your router by Ethernet cable (sorry, no WiFi), download the software and away you go, though some customers say the device can be a bit finicky at times and video signals aren’t true HD quality. Nor do users get DVR functionality.If you just want to watch and record over-the-air HDTV programs at home, a device such as Channel Master DVR+ ($300) might suit you. The small, flat box requires an HD antenna and – don’t be fooled by the name – a separate USB-enabled hard drive to store recorded shows. It has to be connected to your network via cable so you’ll need a WiFi adapter ($40) if your TV is far from your router.Other products meant to stream live or recorded over-the-air shows around the house, or even around the world, include Tablo and HomeRun .Just keep in mind that these options might require some tech skills to set up or limited in other ways. Some devices don’t have WiFi built in or enable streaming outside the home, for example. Others lack comprehensive television guides that make setting up recordings as easy as more costly technologies such as TiVo.The Holy Grail of cheap streaming television might arrive soon for a mainstream audience, but it’s not here yet.Also see: Are you ready to cut the cord?If you haven’t cut the cord on cable TV, you should	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=62D65882-FD72-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27
Most Americans are women, except in these states	By Catey Hill, MarketWatchAccording to data released on Thursday by the Census Bureau, there are just 10 states in the country where men outnumber women. Alaska ranks No. 1 (women make up 47.55% of its population), followed by North Dakota (48.85%), Wyoming (48.98%), Hawaii (49.46%) and Nevada (49.63).On the flip side, there is a higher percentage of women in Washington, D.C. (ladies make up 52.63% of the population there) than any other state, followed by Delaware (51.62%), Rhode Island (51.55%), Massachusetts (51.52%) and Maryland (51.51%). In other words, fellas, you may have better odds in the Northeast — and worse odds in the West and Midwest — if you’re looking for a female mate; and vice versa for ladies seeking men.While these spreads may not look that significant, consider what they mean in actual numbers. In Massachusetts, for example, there are more than 200,000 more women than men and in Maryland there are nearly 180,000 more women.Also read: The only 7 states getting youngerIf you’re looking for a younger — or an older — mate, certain states may be better than others as well. Florida, not surprisingly, has the highest percentage of older residents (18.7% are 65 and older), followed by Maine (17.7%) — and both do have a higher percentage of women than men. Meanwhile, Alaska and Utah have the youngest residents with just 9% and 9.8% of their populations, respectively, over 65 — good news for ladies looking for a young mate as both states have more men than women in them.If you’re curious about how your state or city ranks in terms of age, sex or race, you can check out the new Census Bureau data here .More from MarketWatch:10 insane things people tried to smuggle through airport security10 things snack food companies won’t tell youHow to help your family without blowing your savings	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=01C64EAA-FD39-11E3-B93C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

Beneficiaries of the Iraq crisis	By Ivan MartchevThe two major geopolitical conflicts in the world today are in Ukraine and Syria/Iraq. Both on the surface look unrelated, but both have one major geopolitical player and its adversaries involved. Russia openly supports the Syrian government according to military supply contracts it has signed over the years. The enemies of Assad support the Syrian rebels without such legal framework. On the other hand, Russia allegedly covertly supports the Ukrainian separatists, many say with arms and special forces on the ground the same way Assads enemies support ISIS and other less-nefarious Syrian rebels.Why are the Russians are in the middle of both conflicts? I am of the opinion that both the Syria/Iraq and Ukrainian situations are about energy. The Russians dont want Syria to fall, as it has been their key ally since the Cold War, and it holds the land routes for natural gas from the Middle East to Europe. A fallen Assad regime eventually means much more natural-gas competition in Europe from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. At the same time, the Russians have a problem with an unfriendly government in Kiev, as Ukraine is the ultimate Gazprom choke hold, as 55% of its European exports pass though there.I think that ISIS can be defeated, as they are outnumbered 100:1 by a panicky Iraqi military that ran away from fighting in many places in the North, most notably Mosul and Kirkuk. With the help of U.S. and Iranian special forces working toward the same goal — the same Iranian Revolutionary Guards general who has been helping Damascus fight ISIS there has now arrived to help out in Baghdad with some elite Quds force reinforcements — winning in Iraq is a matter of time.Winning in Iraq against ISIS means also wiping it out from Syria, which probably means that Assad survives due to the spectacular miscalculation of ISISs backers. This should be long-term good for Gazprom /quotes/zigman/248724/delayed/quotes/nls/ogzpy OGZPY +0.45% , which has also recently signed a mega deal in China. Still, from a short-term perspective, Gazprom shares are likely to remain volatile with the developments in Ukraine.Also from a shorter-term tactical perspective, it does not appear that either the Ukrainian or the Iraqi/Syrian situations will be resolved in short order, so one has to prepare scenarios and see what impact they may have on financial markets. While it might seem easy to assume that if oil is going up, one should just buy oil stocks, it is quite a bit more complicated than that. Rising oil prices are good for some energy companies, like unhedged producers, while not so good for those whose margins might be squeezed, like refiners. Oil going up because the Iraqi situation is deteriorating is not good, obviously, for companies with big contracts in Iraq.While an experienced futures trader can probably make money on oil futures (and options on oil futures) in this geopolitical mess, individual investors probably should stay away. Oil spikes are for professional traders and are not easy to handle. While there is an ETF made up of oil futures — the United States Oil Fund /quotes/zigman/413712/delayed/quotes/nls/uso USO -0.39%  — this unleveraged ETF is for experts involved in short-term trading only, since backwardation in the futures market has literally been killing it.As futures positions roll over into different expiration dates each month, the differences in price add up over time. The USO is losing value when compared to front-month oil futures. At one point, there was a case where the oil market would adjust, with only the first couple of months in contango (so all futures funds, not only USO, would have to roll over into more expensive futures), while the rest of the futures curve was in backwardation.One company that has proven time and again that it can serve as the ultimate defensive energy investment is Exxon Mobil /quotes/zigman/203975/delayed/quotes/nls/xom XOM +1.00% . The company typically has a large cash position on its balance sheet — often the second largest cash position in the S&P 500 — and its cash flows are less cyclical due to its integrated nature. There were days in late 2008 when both oil and the overall stock market were selling off while XOM was rallying.While Exxon management has often been criticized for not being generous with dividends (in percentage yield) or buybacks, few mention that XOM is the single biggest payer of dividends in the U.S. market, having paid $10.875 billion in the past 12 months. (The second biggest payer of dividends, with the largest corporate cash pile in history, is Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +0.59% , having paid out $10.8 billion in the last 12 months.)There are two recent situations where the operational leverage of oil prices can likely be seen in practice, should Iraq deteriorate to the point of creating a price spike in oil. Marathon Oil /quotes/zigman/292008/delayed/quotes/nls/mro MRO +1.77%  and ConocoPhillips /quotes/zigman/294662/delayed/quotes/nls/cop COP +0.63%  spun off refining subsidiaries as Marathon Petroleum /quotes/zigman/5611608/delayed/quotes/nls/mpc MPC +1.28%  and Phillips66 /quotes/zigman/9483013/delayed/quotes/nls/psx PSX +0.62% . Refiners care about refining margins while unhedged producers care about the price of oil. Both producers have been doing better than their former refining subsidiaries since March.In theory, both COP and MRO should benefit more from an Iraqi oil spike more, than MPC and PSX. So, I am beginning to wonder is it not possible to put on a before-the-spinoffs unthinkable pair trade where one is long COP and MRO and short MPC ans PSX as a real life barometer of Iraqs spectacular quagmire.Ivan Martchev is a investment specialist with institutional money manager Navellier and Associates.

Feds Bullard says its getting harder to justify low rates	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) - It is getting harder and harder to justify continued low rates because it is more difficult to argue that credit markets remain in disrepair so long after the financial crisis, said James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Fed, on Thursday. In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, Bullard said Fed bond buying might not have hurt savers because it was hard to argue that credit markets were functioning smoothly in the crisis. The policy of the FOMC has been that, on balance, low real yields have helped repair the damage of the crisis more quickly, and Bullard said he largely agreed. In his speech, Bullard said that the Feds bond buying had not made wealth inequality worse, even though the policy has boosted stock prices. He said that a higher inflation target would hurt the poorest segment of society. As time passes, however, it becomes more and more difficult to argue that credit markets remain in a state of disrepair, and thus harder and harder to justify continued low real rates, he said.

How you can game your Google search results	By Quentin FottrellLast month, the European Union’s highest court gave Europeans the right to delete “inadequate, irrelevant… or excessive” data from Google’s search results. While the First Amendment’s protection of the right to freedom of speech makes a similar move here unlikely, experts say there are many ways American consumers can quietly manage their Google search results. It may take some time though: Each request must be assessed individually before the offending search result is made disappear.The European Court of Justice ruling essentially gives people the right to be forgotten in (or deleted from) Google’s search results. The plaintiff in the ruling was Mario Costeja González. He wanted to remove his name from Google /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%   search results that linked to newspaper stories from 1998 relating to a real-estate auction to recover his social security debts; although the issue was resolved, those stories still popped up in Google searches.“This is a big deal,” says Michael Fertik, CEO and founder of Reputation.com, one of many paid — and free — services to help consumers keep their Web use anonymous. “For the first time, the law is giving human dignity a similar level of protection as copyright.” However, this will be a huge logistical issue for search engines like Google, Bing /quotes/zigman/20493/delayed/quotes/nls/msft MSFT -0.24%   and Yahoo /quotes/zigman/59898/delayed/quotes/nls/yhoo YHOO +0.72%   to manage, as they are likely to be inundated with requests to remove information about people, he adds.For individuals or companies, Google’s search results favor the most popular social media profiles from sites like Google+, Instagram, Facebook /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB -0.24%   and Pinterest, says Don Sorensen, president of Big Blue Robot, a reputation management firm in Oren, Utah. This helps people promote the good (personal branding) over the bad (negative comments by customers, or even ex-spouses or former employees). “All social media profiles should be linked,” Sorensen says. “If you have a YouTube channel, you want to link that to your Twitter /quotes/zigman/23556538/delayed/quotes/nls/twtr TWTR -1.05%   profile and link that to your Instagram, and so on.”There is one irony in the E.U. court ruling: Mario Costeja González’s name now pops up in 7,320 U.S. Google search results. But therein lies a lesson for those who wish to control their online image. “Don’t wait for a problem,” Fertik says. “Claim your Google real estate now. Create videos and blogs in your name and create your own URL with your first and last name. Post photos of yourself on your site and tag with your name.” Fresh, mixed-media content is quick to show up in Google searches, he says.What’s more, Google already offers U.S. consumers the right of reply when it comes to egregious comments on the company’s own web pages. This service gives individuals the opportunity to report a blog that impersonates them, the disclosure of private information, harassment and bullying behavior from actual pages (including blogs, Google+, Web and image search and YouTube). But this doesn’t apply to he said/she said arguments online or negative reviews that are not deemed libelous.Even leaving aside the practicalities of sifting through requests, Americans might be waiting a long time for Google to expand its generosity in deleting search results. In a 1989 case that applies to online media today, the U.S. Supreme Court held that states cannot pass laws restricting the media from disseminating truthful — if embarrassing — information, says Aaron Messing, a privacy attorney with OlenderFeldman in Summit, N.J.Even if the search result is erased, the original item will obviously still exist. Google doesn’t own the Internet, of course, it just provides a gateway and the best way to get rid of a link is to contact the website or blog directly, especially if the comments or images are offensive.In a 2010 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt, offered a more drastic solution for young Americans with an Internet footprint they can’t erase: Change your name.Some U.S. states already want to help people put their youthful indiscretions behind them. “In certain cases, one would have the right for this information to be removed,” says Adam Levin, co-founder of online security company Identity Theft 911. In the first law of its kind, Governor Jerry Brown (D-Calif.) signed the “erase bill” last January. The law requires apps and websites to inform registered minors of their right to delete postings, although they may remain on their servers; the law comes into effect in 2015.That said, deleting information that’s deemed irrelevant or excessive — as stated in the E.U. court ruling — is not necessarily a good thing for everyone, especially when it comes to checking up on a potential employee, business partner or even future spouse, experts say. “That would be a great loss of information for Americans,” says Floyd Abrams, a partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel, a law firm in New York. “The United States seeks to protect privacy in a variety of ways but not by criminalizing truth-telling.”Other articles by Quentin Fottrell:5 apps for spying on your spouseWhy teens are rebelling against FacebookHow to avoid buying fake products online10 things Google won’t tell you	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A1B8AFD8-DB89-11E3-B1A5-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Major brokers cut ties to Barclays dark pool	By Bradley HopeBroker-dealers including Deutsche Bank /quotes/zigman/207036/delayed DE:DBK -0.26% , Royal Bank of Canada /quotes/zigman/18007/delayed CA:RY +0.06%   and ITG have removed connections to the dark pool, called Barclays LX, from their routing systems, the people said. In some cases, the decision was a precautionary measure after the lawsuit was filed and in others it was the result of requests from large institutional investors, they said.Brokers have been receiving an influx of calls from investors since the complaint against Barclays /quotes/zigman/301787/delayed UK:BARC -0.36%   was made public yesterday afternoon, said David Mechner, chief executive of Pragma Securities LLC, which sells computer models to brokers and investors to help them trade stocks.“We have had a lot of requests to turn them off,” he said of Barclays LX.Barclays was accused of allegedly lying to customers about how it favors high-frequency traders in its dark pool, according to the lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. In emails cited in the suit, Barclays executives appear to have allegedly worked to alter reports and communications with clients to mislead them about how their dark pool works.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:5 (more) cheap stocks in the No. 1 energy sector10 reasons single men should move to the Northeast	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C6BE1DF0-FD4D-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26
U.K. home builders climb while Barclays slides	By Carla Mozee, MarketWatchU.K.’s FTSE 100 index /quotes/zigman/3173262/delayed UK:UKX +0.01% ended up less than 2 points at 6,735.12, but swung between gains and losses during the session.Housing stocks ranked among the session’s best performers after the Bank of England outlined measures aimed at cooling the U.K.’s housing boom. Housing stocks this week had come under pressure ahead of the bank’s announcement, but on Thursday, Persimmon PLC /quotes/zigman/155560/delayed UK:PSN -0.84% was pushed up 5% and Barratt Developments PLC /quotes/zigman/152374/delayed UK:BDEV -1.22%  climbed 4.8%.The central bank’s Financial Policy Committee said in its report that debt levels for households haven’t yet posed a risk to the stability of the financial system, but that it wants to take steps to head off potential risks.“The implication is that the market is not out of control,” said Toby Nangle, head of multi-asset allocation at Threadneedle Investments in London, in a telephone interview. “By phrasing the macroprudential controls in the way that they have, for many people who’ve been long housing stocks and long sterling, it’s given a bit of cause for relief,” he said.Sterling /quotes/zigman/4867886/realtime/sampled GBPUSD +0.0231%  rose above the $1.70 level against the U.S. dollar in the wake of the housing proposals.House prices in the U.K. have risen nearly 10% in the year to April, according to the Office for National Statistics.Among other property developers, British Land Co. /quotes/zigman/152699/delayed UK:BLND -1.42% rose 1.4%. Off the benchmark, Taylor Wimpey PLC /quotes/zigman/156565/delayed UK:TW 0.00%  gained 5.2% and Berkeley Group Holdings PLC /quotes/zigman/354908/delayed UK:BKG -0.60%  rose 3.2%.The day’s best price performance came from a 6.2% rise in London Stock Exchange Group shares /quotes/zigman/409946/delayed UK:LSE -0.59%  after the exchange operator said it’s buying Frank Russell Co., a U.S.-based stock-index and asset-management business, for $2.7 billion. The stock-index unit of Russell is behind the Russell 2000 /quotes/zigman/2759624/delayed RUT +0.72%  gauge of small-cap stocks.Barclays shares /quotes/zigman/301787/delayed UK:BARC -0.36%   /quotes/zigman/152323/delayed/quotes/nls/bcs BCS +1.14% put in the worst performance on the index, falling 6.5% to £2.15 ($3.66) to trade at levels not seen since November 2012, according to FactSet data. The decline was set off after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Wednesday said he’s filing a civil lawsuit over how the bank operates its dark pool. Dark pools, private trading platforms that allow for block trades, are designed to allow firms to make anonymous trades without disclosing their hands.The lawsuit alleges Barclays dramatically increased the market share of its dark pool through a series of false statements to clients and investors about how, and for whose benefit, Barclays operates its dark pool.Litigation costs “are a challenge to Barclays executing its strategic plan, as they put pressure on the capital base, which based on our estimates pro forma for litigation, is the weakest of the peer group,” said Credit Suisse in a note Thursday.Credit Suisse estimates banking-sector litigation costs of $104 billion, up from its $58 billion estimate the year before, “and we see upward risk to this estimate. We have seen banks with legacy litigation risk starting to materially underperform those less exposed.”Elsewhere in the banking sector, Standard Chartered PLC /quotes/zigman/22532/delayed UK:STAN -0.41%  fell 4.3% after warning its first half operating profit will be 20% lower than a year earlier.

Europe stocks run lower after Fed rate comment	By Carla Mozee, MarketWatchThe Stoxx Europe 600 index /quotes/zigman/2380150/delayed XX:SXXP -0.28%  lost 1 point to end at 341.86, swept lower after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said a rate hike by the Fed could take place at the end of the first quarter of 2015. He expects a rise in inflation above the 2% level next year, which will spur a debate about the path of interest rates at the Fed, said Bullard during an appearance on the Fox Business Network.While Bullard said in May he sees a rate increase coming late in the first quarter of next year, bets currently on the fed funds futures market indicate a rate hike will take place in the middle of 2015. On Wall Street intraday, the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.55% was down 0.4% and the Dow industrials /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.54% were off session lows after losing more than 100 points.European stocks had been on track for its first win in five sessions before the turnaround. The index on Wednesday dropped 1.1%, the steepest decline since mid-April according to FactSet data, as equities keyed off a slide in U.S. equities.Bank stocks fell, though shares of Barclays PLC /quotes/zigman/301787/delayed UK:BARC -0.36%  had already been suffering after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman launched a civil lawsuit against the bank on Wednesday. Barclays shares dropped 6.5% to a 19-month low.The lawsuit alleges Barclays dramatically increased the market share of its dark pool through a series of false statements to clients and investors about how, and for whose benefit, the bank operates its dark pool. Dark pools, private trading platforms that allow block trades, are designed to let firms make anonymous trades without disclosing their hands.In July 2012, the Bank of England pushed out Barclays’s then-chief executive Bob Diamond a month after the lender was fined for rigging the Libor benchmark interest rate.“Other European banks operating dark pools are likely to also face charges in the future,” said Credit Suisse analyst Amit Goel in a note Thursday, adding that UBS AG may face $187 million in litigation costs tied to its U.S. dark-pool operation. Shares of UBS /quotes/zigman/411392/delayed/quotes/nls/ubs UBS +0.80%  fell 3%.Meanwhile, Standard Chartered PLC shares /quotes/zigman/22532/delayed UK:STAN -0.41%  dropped 4.3% after the bank, which focus on emerging markets, warned about its first half operating profit.But heading up advancers in Thursday’s session was London Stock Exchange /quotes/zigman/409946/delayed UK:LSE -0.59% , rising 6.1% after the exchange operator said it’s acquiring U.S.-based asset manager Frank Russell Co. for $2.7 billion. LSE topped winners on the U.K.’s FTSE 100 index /quotes/zigman/3173262/delayed UK:UKX +0.01% , though that index pared gains for a finish of less than 2 points higher at 6,735.12.Fresenius Medical Care AG /quotes/zigman/167496/delayed DE:FME +0.98%  popped up 2.6%, after a ratings upgrade at Credit Suisse to outperform from neutral on Thursday.Among country indexes, France’s CAC 40 index /quotes/zigman/3173214/delayed FR:PX1 -0.47%  fell 0.5% to 4,439.63, and Germany’s DAX 30 equity index /quotes/zigman/2380246/delayed DX:DAX -0.20% lost 0.6% to 9,804.90.FIFA bans World Cup player Suarez after biting incidentU.S. House Speaker Boehner to sue Obama administrationGoogle’s smartwatch demo: still early days	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=86C782F2-FC7D-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

IKEA to raise minimum wage at U.S. stores	By Anna PriorThe change will increase the average minimum hourly wage in U.S. stores by $1.59 to $10.76, a move that will affect about half of IKEA’s retail employees in the U.S., the company said.The increase is based on a living-wage calculator, which takes into consideration housing, food, medical and transportation costs, plus annual taxes, the company said, noting that the hourly wage will vary based on the cost of living in each IKEA U.S. location.All 38 existing U.S. retail locations, as well as IKEA’s three new locations scheduled to open before the end of 2015, will adopt the new structure, the company said.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=158F4044-FD49-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26
Is Zulily in a short squeeze again?	By Tom Lloyd Sr.Now Zulily /quotes/zigman/22855552/delayed/quotes/nls/zu ZU +1.55% has just had some good news in the form of an upgrade from Goldman Sachs. According to Yahoo Finance, about 55% of the float is short , and the question is will those shorts scrambling to buy the stock to cover their short positions? If so, how high will price go? Well, this news upgrading the stock is not as strong as a big positive surprise in earnings. But any good news on ZU will move it up, and if the shorts are caught by surprise, they will have to buy, thus exaggerating the move up regardless of the importance.ZU is off to a strong start today, having gapped open from 40 to 42, on top of Wednesdays jump from 37 to 40. As you can see on the charts, price gapped down from 45, and there is probably little resistance to stop price from moving up to fill the gap and hit 45 again. Some think ZU shares could quickly move to 50. Another broker has upgraded ZU, and you can track the analyst upgrades here.ZU may continue Wednesdays pattern of opening with a big gap and then moving sideways for the rest of the day. My guess is that it may follow this pattern tomorrow as any margin calls are executed on the open.Back on Feb. 5, I wrote the following in my newsletter:“Zulily sits at 58.41, up 15.57, or 36%, not bad for one day’s work. Usually, I would not pay attention to such a wild move up, but this is interesting from both a trading and investing viewpoint.Trading“Traders love short squeezes and grossly inefficient markets. ZU has produced all of that with 113 million shares outstanding, but only an 18-million-share float, and 18% of that was short. No surprise at the big jump in price. Traders may have missed this move up, but they wont miss the rest of the squeeze.“They also wont miss the drop in price after the inflated pricing is finished. After all, the highest analyst’s 12-month target is 47. And there are only a few analysts. The surprise in earnings will not change that target very much. Unfortunately the shorts must cover now, even though they know the price will eventually fall back to a more efficient market and price. Fundamental analysis is useless in this situation, and only technical analysis can be used, which is why traders use it.InvestingThe funny part about all of this is that when price returns from the stratosphere, ZU is an interesting copy of Amazon. It may not make much money, but it will grow rapidly as indicated by the latest earnings report. The AMZN model is to offer prices and services that consumers love, grow revenues exponentially, generate lots of cash and not so much profit. ZU has found its niche and is doing the same. And it is as overvalued as AMZN.”And again Wednesday, June 25, I wrote the following to my subscribers:“The chart shows the bottom in place and signals turning up with price. It is testing resistance here. If it breaks above it, it could continue to fill the gap down from 45 in May. Notice the positive break above the 50-day downtrend.The short ratio is near 3, but about 55% of the float is short according to Yahoo.com. That short covering would explain the 9% jump today. If the shorts continue to cover, price will move up quickly to fill the gap to 45. That is what the daytraders will be watching and playing.”So, not much has changed with ZU, except that Goldman has spoken. Is there a secondary offering coming?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=19D7348E-7B88-455F-B916-3D57FF8B8739&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

New York court blocks proposed ban on large sugary drinks	By Michael Howard SaulThat leaved the controversial proposal in the hands of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who pledged last year to advance the ban at the City Council if the courts rejected it.In May 2012, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed prohibiting mobile food carts, delis and concessions at movie theaters, stadiums or arenas from selling sugary drinks in cups or containers larger than 16 ounces. The city’s Board of Health, a panel whose members were each appointed by the mayor, approved the ban in September of that year. But the courts have prevented the city from imposing the ban.In its majority opinion, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that the Board of Health “exceeded the scope of its regulatory authority. By choosing among competing policy goals, without any legislative delegation or guidance, the board engaged in law-making and thus infringed upon the legislative jurisdiction of the City Council.”When running for mayor last year, Mr. de Blasio, a supporter of the ban, said he would pursue council legislation to impose the ban if the courts ultimately refused to let the city move forward. A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday morning.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:4 things GoPro needs to tackle in order to succeedKlinsmann tells your boss you’re watching the game10 reasons single men should move to the Northeast	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=1DA8267E-FD49-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

5 (more) cheap stocks in the No. 1 energy sector	By Philip van Doorn, MarketWatchTo help investors, we have identified five more oil and gas stocks that trade cheaply relative to 2015 earnings estimates for investors who are keen to juice their portfolios.The S&P 500 Index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.55%  is up 5.5% in 2014, a far cry from the 30%-plus surge last year. But it’s still a good showing, with a steady setting of new record highs, even as many market watchers warn of a coming correction.Taking a broader view, the S&P Composite 1500 Index is up 5%, and the three strongest subsectors have been Oil & Gas Storage and Transportation, with a 24% advance; Oil & Gas Exploration and Production, up 20%; and Oil & Gas Equipment and Services, which has risen 19%. Those are the best performances among the subsectors.The expansion of U.S. oil and natural gas production is helping energy companies boost revenue and earnings, which prompts sell-side analysts to raise their estimates, supporting rising stock prices. And there’s plenty of international uncertainty generating higher energy prices, which tends to boost profits. Events putting upward pressure on fuel prices include a possible disruption to the flow of natural gas needed by western European countries, since so much gas flows from Russia through Ukraine, as well as the civil war in Iraq, which now involves Iran and Syria.As a result, the spot price for natural gas at the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 7% to $4.54 per million British thermal units on Tuesday, with the price of Brent crude oil up 3% to $114.65 a barrel.Anyway, following the market close April 29, we identified a select list of the five cheapest oil and gas stocks. Those traded the lowest to consensus 2015 earnings estimates among oil and gas producers, integrated oil companies, gas distributors, as well as pipeline operators, oil services and equipment providers, and contract drillers. The list was a conservative one, limited to companies that had produced profits over the previous five years.All five stocks on the list have performed well since that article was published:The best performer among companies on the list is ConocoPhillips /quotes/zigman/294662/delayed/quotes/nls/cop COP +0.63% , returning 15% from April 29 through Tuesday’s close at $74.02.Excluding special items, ConocoPhillips reported first-quarter earnings of $2.1 billion, or $1.71 a share, increasing from $1.8 billion, or $1.42, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10% to $16 billion.To identify more opportunities for investors, we have put together a new list of the five stocks among the components of the S&P 1500 Oil & Gas Storage and Transportation, Oil & Gas Exploration and Production, and Oil & Gas Equipment and Services subsectors trading lowest to consensus 2015 earnings estimates among analysts polled by FactSet:This time we have taken a more aggressive approach, with no effort to pare the list with any conservative criteria. Still, the companies are expected by analysts to post profits in 2015.As you can see from the total returns this year and last, there’s plenty of volatility. And two companies have been heavily shorted by investors. Here’s more on all five stocks:Tidewater EPS comparison at FindTheBestThe cheapest stock on the new list is Tidewater Inc. /quotes/zigman/242635/delayed/quotes/nls/tdw TDW -0.18%  of New Orleans, which closed at $55.35 Tuesday and trades for 9.8 times the consensus 2015 earnings estimate of $5.67 a share. To put that forward price-to-earnings ratio in perspective, the S&P 1500 Composite Energy Index trades for 14.5 times the aggregate 2015 EPS estimate, according to FactSet. The company is the only one on this new list that pays a dividend, with a yield of 1.81%.Tidewater runs a fleet of vessels supporting the offshore oil drilling industry around the world.For its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, the company reported a 12% increase in revenue to $367 million. Rising interest payments and foreign exchange losses pushed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings down to $43.4 million, or 88 cents a share, from $46.6 million, or 95 cents.For all of fiscal 2014, Tidewater reported adjusted EPS of $3.80, excluding a goodwill impairment charge, costs associated with its acquisition of Troms Offshore. That was quite an increase from adjusted EPS of $3.10 during fiscal 2013.Tidewater CEO Jeff Platt, during the company’s earnings call May 21, said the company remained “generally bullish” in its outlook for “the offshore support vessel industry.”“As a result, we generally disagree with the overly negative sentiment that a number of analysts and investors that follow the offshore sector have expressed in recent months,” he added.The company on May 16 said it hadn’t yet repurchased any shares under its existing $200 million buyback program, but it also announced another $200 million program to repurchase shares in the open market until June 30, 2015.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9BF698BC-FC72-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Now even PayPal has a security flaw	By Priya Anand, MarketWatchPayPal apps for iOS and Android devices don’t support two-factor, so they are designed to lock out users who use the security codes. Researchers at Duo Labs, a company that sells two-factor authentication products, found that a user can trick the app into ignoring flags that call for a second mode of verifying the user’s identity.“An attacker only needs a victim’s PayPal username and password in order to access a two-factor protected account and send money. The protection offered by the two-factor Security Key mechanism can be bypassed and essentially nullified,” the researchers wrote in a blog .PayPal has more than 148 million active users and processed about $27 billion in mobile payments in 2013, up 99% from 2012, according to figures on the company’s website. It wrote in a response blog that “all PayPal accounts remain secure” because the bug researchers found is related to the extra security layer customers can opt into – not the initial layer. The message: If the door is deadbolted, the police lock is just an extra precaution.“We have extensive fraud and risk detection models and dedicated security teams that work to help keep our customers’ accounts secure from fraudulent transactions, everyday,” the blog says .PayPal has disabled the ability for people who use two-factor authentication to use the PayPal mobile apps and “certain other mobile apps,” according to the blog.Duo Labs senior security researcher Zach Lanier says Duo began investigating the PayPal issue after a friend of the Michigan-based security firm’s CEO realized he could bypass the two-factor system on his own account in March. Duo sent more information on the flaw to PayPal, and Lanier says the company dragged its feet.Lanier says PayPal told Duo it will issue a full fix for the security problem on July 28. PayPal did not immediately return a request for comment on that date and the time span between identifying the issue and releasing a fix.In May, PayPal’s parent company eBay /quotes/zigman/76117/delayed/quotes/nls/ebay EBAY +0.77%   told users to change their passwords because a database that contained passcodes but no financial information was compromised earlier this year. EBay said then that PayPal’s information was not included in the breached database and that all financial data was encrypted and stored on a separate network.New day, new breach. The Identity Theft Resource Center counts more than 350 breaches for just this year, exposing more than 10 million records. And in April, a widespread Internet bug called Heartbleed was discovered, unveiling a major security hole in two-thirds of websites. At that time, experts said that two-step authentication was crucial to protecting data.Also see:5 rules for using the Internet after ‘Heartbleed’Will car-hacking become the new carjacking?5 ways to protect yourself from credit-card fraud	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=07A1C190-FD45-11E3-B93C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Pound back above $1.70; dollar falls vs. yen	By Saumya Vaishampayan, MarketWatchThe Bank of England said in its Financial Stability report that loans of more than 4.5 times a borrower’s income should make up no more than 15% of banks’ mortgage books.The pound /quotes/zigman/4867886/realtime/sampled GBPUSD +0.0231%  rose to $1.7028 from $1.6983 late Wednesday.At the heart of the matter is concern over a fallout from an eventual rise in U.K. interest rates, likely to be the first rate hike by a major central bank. U.K. housing prices surged 9.9% in April from a year earlier, which could cause residents to apply for loans that could become harder to pay with higher interest rates. That could ripple across the economy, possibly hampering a recovery.Still, BOE Gov. Mark Carney said the measures don’t change the economic outlook and are instead geared at reducing “tail risks from the property market,” said Robert Lynch, a currency strategist at HSBC, in a note.“The measures were not so draconian or severe as to suggest a diminished need for future BOE rate hikes and as a result, both front end yields and sterling have firmed in the wake of the event,” Lynch wrote.The dollar /quotes/zigman/4868099/realtime/sampled USDJPY -0.1202%  fell to ¥101.68 from ¥101.87 late Wednesday, with losses accelerating in the wake of the U.S. data.In the U.S., weekly jobless claims fell by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 312,000, remaining near a postrecession low. Economists had expected claims to fall to 310,000, according to a MarketWatch poll.Consumer spending rose 0.2% in May after a flat reading in April, missing expectations. Inflation as measured by the PCE price index rose 0.2% in May to hit an annual rate of 1.8%. That’s the highest rate since late 2012. The core PCE index, which excludes food and energy, rose to an annual rate of 1.5% in May. Inflation should rise above 2% next year, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Thursday.The ICE dollar index /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY +0.07% , a gauge of the currency’s strength against a basket of six rivals, was at 80.214 versus 80.210 late Wednesday.

FIFA puts record ban on World Cup player Suarez for biting	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Soccer association FIFA on Thursday announced that its banning Uruguayan soccer player Luis Suarez from all soccer games and related activity for four months, following an incident in which Suarez appeared to bite Italys Giorgio Chiellini during a World Cup match on June 24. The player Luis Suárez is banned from taking part in any kind of football-related activity (administrative, sports or any other) for a period of four (4) months in accordance with art. 22 of the FDC, FIFA said in a statement. The ban is the longest in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban on Italys Mauro Tassotti for breaking Spains Luis Enríques nose in 1994 with an elbow. Suarez will also pay a 100,000 Swiss franc fine. Uruguay beat Italy 1-0 in the match, with Suarez and Chiellini tussling in the Italy penalty area late in the game. Suarez, who plays for Liverpool, has denied biting the Italian player.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A5620536-8BAB-431A-945A-B9786003CB39&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Will car-hacking become the new carjacking?	By Priya AnandThe first Android Auto-equipped cars will be available this year. Drivers will be able to control the navigation, communication and music systems with their voices — responding to text messages by speaking, for example. The Internet search giant also unveiled its prototype last month for a fleet of self-driving cars — compact two-seaters sans steering wheels, accelerators and brakes, which cruise along at a maximum speed of 25 mph and virtually turn drivers into passengers.Google’s /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%   moves mean that as the auto industry modernizes fleets, it will work more closely with a company whose main business is already the Internet. But this also raises questions about new potential vulnerabilities to attacks and the collection of consumers’ personal data. The number of malicious, malware-infected apps in the Google Play store nearly quadrupled from 2011 to 2013, according to the San Francisco-based security firm RiskIQ. Google did not respond to an emailed request for comment about Android Auto.The average vehicle already contains around 60 microprocessors and more than 10 million lines of software code, according to a January report by the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research. (By comparison, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner runs on about 18 million lines of code.)There were more than 26 million connected cars on the road last year, a figure that will rise to 152 million by 2020, the industry group IHS Automotive estimates. Many cars collect location-based data to give drivers turn-by-turn directions, for example, and some have lane assistance features that use radars to keep the vehicle from drifting, or to track diagnostics. In the future, drivers can expect to stream music, download apps, navigate with heads-up touch-screen displays and even alert people when they’re drowsy behind the wheel or when their blood sugar is low, if they’re diabetic.More than half of drivers worry that hackers might figure out how to sneak past the security systems in driverless cars, according to a February survey by Mason, Ohio-based Seapine Software. And with reason: Researchers have repeatedly shown in recent years that it’s possible to hack into connected cars and take control of steering wheels, brakes, engines and accelerators.Chris Valasek, director of security intelligence at the computer security company IOActive, spent about a year researching how to hack cars and found that “unfortunately, these things were designed a long time ago” and there’s often no authentication process to supervise who can access a car’s controls. He took control of the wheels, brakes, accelerations and displays in a Toyota /quotes/zigman/199376/delayed/quotes/nls/tm TM -0.12%  Prius and a Ford /quotes/zigman/264304/delayed/quotes/nls/f F +0.58%  Escape.Little computers called electronic control units have been commonplace in vehicles since the 1990s. Valasek and his co-hacker plugged their laptops into those devices and found they could take complete control of the cars. Internet connection could make hacking remotely easier, and Android Auto may open up vehicles to even more risk -- for example, if phones are infected with malware, or if someone hacks the car to siphon information from devices. Google has not yet released specifics on its security protocols.“Before, you had to worry about people maybe remotely compromising the infotainment system via Bluetooth or maybe a cellular network. This adds another attack vector in,” Valasek says.Google says 40 more automakers have joined its Open Auto Alliance, a group it created in January to promote connected car technology. The introduction of Android Auto will also foster conversations about connected car design and security before driverless vehicles hit the roads en masse, says Scott Morrison, who oversees automotive app engineering as senior vice president at the software company CA Technologies.“It’s a chance for the automotive designers and the mobile designers to start dating before they get married, so to speak,” he says.Experts say drivers shouldn’t get too paranoid about their cars being hacked next time they hit the road. They say it’s still more profitable and much easier for hackers to target bank accounts, but as wired vehicles become more commonplace, security needs to be a bigger concern. Still, if hackers are already experienced with Android apps, the new Google auto system could make attack planning easier.Google has said that the company encrypts all in-going and outgoing car communications and limits how much the vehicle can be controlled by someone with remote access.Lawmakers have raised concerns about the security features built into connected cars, as well as the privacy issues surrounding auto manufacturers’ collection of consumer data.“Can some 14-year old in Indonesia figure out how to do this and just shut your car down?” Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, said at a Senate hearing last year.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said last year that it would research automated vehicles and the cybersecurity issues they present to eventually develop a set of baseline requirements. The agency said states are better suited to take the lead on issues like licensing, driver training and conditions of operation.And the University of Michigan’s Mobility Transformation Center said last month that it would build a 32-acre simulated city to test automated cars with partners including Ford, General Motors /quotes/zigman/1466682/delayed/quotes/nls/gm GM 0.00%   and Toyota. It will include a lab that tests vehicles’ security and firewalls to identify hacking risks, says John Maddox, director of the school’s Transportation Research Institute.Symantec /quotes/zigman/78627/delayed/quotes/nls/symc SYMC +1.36% , the Mountain View, Calif.-based security firm located near the Googleplex, is in “deeply engaged conversations” with its customers about securing automated cars, says Stephen Gillett, the company’s chief operating officer. Google is a Symantec customer.“How do we protect your car as it’s talking to others so it doesn’t get compromised?” he says, describing the types of conversations Symantec has with auto manufacturers and the companies that provide their entertainment systems.(This story was updated from an earlier version.)Also see:4 ‘smart home’ gadgets you don’t want hackedDoes your broker protect your data?Car insurance would be a lot cheaper without driversDriver’s ed teachers laugh at Google’s car	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8147075A-EB41-11E3-8B49-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26
Consumers splurge on cars in May, that’s it	By Jeffry Bartash, MarketWatchThe government said consumer spending climbed 0.2% last month, driven largely by the sale of new autos. Economists polled by MarketWatch were expecting a 0.4% increase, especially after a flat reading in April.Spending was even weaker when adjusted for inflation, falling for the second straight month amid a sharp uptick in prices since February. “Weakness in real spending is likely in part a consequence of a recent pickup in inflation,” economists at BNP Paribas wrote in a research note.The lackluster pace of consumer demand — the engine of U.S. economic activity — spurred many forecasters to mark down their estimates for second-quarter growth. The economy is now seen expanding at a 3.6% clip in the April-to-June period, down from a prior estimate of 3.8%, according to the MarketWatch survey. And some analysts see growth failing to reach 3% in the quarter.Personal incomes, meanwhile, rose 0.4% to mark the fifth straight gain, the Commerce Department said.The increase in incomes in the first five months of this year is the fastest since the end of 2011 and early 2012. Over the past 12 months incomes have risen 3.5%, boosted by an upturn in hiring that’s putting more people to work and putting cash in their pockets.Instead of spending the money in May, though, Americans pocketed much of the gains. The U.S. savings rate rose to 4.8% from 4.5%, hitting its highest level in eight months.Consumer spending has been soft since the recession ended in mid-2009 as Americans work to pay down debt and rebuild their savings. Consumption accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy’s activity.One reason Americans aren’t spending more is because of slow inflation-adjusted wage growth. Even though incomes have risen 3.5% in the past year, for instance, the increase in disposable income is a much smaller 1.9%. Disposable income is what’s left after taxes and inflation.What’s more, the recent upsurge in inflation in a variety of goods from steak to gasoline is hitting Americans in the pocketbook. Inflation as gauged by the PCE price index increased by 0.2% in May, and it’s up 1.8% in the past 12 months. That’s the fastest year-over-year increase since late 2012, further evidence that price pressures continue to build.The Federal Reserve has been trying to boost inflation closer to the 2% mark because the central bank believes it would be beneficial to the economy. Yet the Fed might need to raise interest rates sooner than it planned unless the increasing pace of inflation starts to moderate in the near future.In April, consumer spending was revised to show no change instead of falling 0.1%. Incomes were unchanged at a 0.3% increase.Barclays favored high-frequency traders in dark pool, New York AG allegesTime for Yellen to target inflation, worry less about jobs	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=FFDA0150-FD23-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26
Nike earnings: World Cup spending to be in focus	By Andria Cheng, MarketWatchEarnings: Analysts are expecting Nike’s profit for the quarter ended May 31 to fall to 75 cents a share from 76 cents a share in the year-earlier period, according to FactSet. The main reason for the decline is the amount the company has spent on the World Cup, which it projects will raise its overall marketing costs by 30%. . Among other initiatives, Nike shot a commercial called “ Winner Stays ” that has garnered more than 81 million views on YouTube, along with “The Last Game” , an animated film featuring star soccer players as characters. This tournament marks the first time that Nike has beaten Adidas in the number of national teams it is sponsoring.Revenue: Bolstered partly by World Cup-related orders, FactSet data show Nike’s /quotes/zigman/235840/delayed/quotes/nls/nke NKE +0.85%  sales are expected to rise to $7.34 billion for the quarter from $6.7 billion a year ago. By region, Sterne Agee analyst Sam Poser estimates sales minus currency translations will rise 8% in North America, 18% in Western Europe, 14% in Central and Eastern Europe and 21% in emerging markets. The analyst estimates that China sales will drop 1% while Japan sales rise 4%.Most analysts expect the company’s shoe and apparel orders for the next five months, a key metric and indicator of future sales, to rise at least 10%. Susquehanna Financial analyst Christopher Svezia said he expects orders excluding currency moves to rise up to 13%, including a jump of up to 9% in North America, up to 24% in Western Europe and as much as 20% in emerging markets. He expects China orders to rise up to 3%.Stock reaction: Nike shares have fallen 2.8% this year through Wednesday, making them the seventh-worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Nike in March warned that a stronger dollar would continue to hurt its overseas sales. The company also warned of the increased World Cup-related marketing spending, and cautioned that its key growth market, China, won’t see all of its financial metrics improve “in a linear fashion.” China, which saw a decline in third-quarter orders, is Nike’s most profitable region and a key part of the company’s goal to reach $36 billion in sales by fiscal 2017, up from almost $28 billion last year, analysts said.Key points: In addition to the World Cup and its impact on emerging market and European business growth, investors want more evidence that Nike’s move to turn around its business in China is on track. Some analysts said they want to know whether Nike has seen a boost from a decline in cotton prices, and whether its product price hike has aided margins. In the U.S., Nike’s largest market, investors want to know if the strength in basketball gear and a shift toward athletic fashions has continued. Investors also want to hear more about Nike’s plan to increase its online sales, which analysts estimate at 2% of total sales, after the company recently named EBay /quotes/zigman/76117/delayed/quotes/nls/ebay EBAY +0.77%  CEO John Donahoe to its board.More reads from MarketWatch:How Las Vegas decides which World Cup gear you can buyCompanies use in-house baristas, social networks to get brain-storming going	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7FA1F82A-FAE5-11E3-AE23-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

How to beat ETFs	By Brett Arends, MarketWatchAnd there’s a lot to be said for ETFs, including low costs, easy trading, and access to a huge array of different investment opportunities. If you fancy investing in crisis-stricken Freedonia, or you want to buy a basket of gold, platinum and silver in one easy trade, there’s an ETF out there for you.But what if you could do better than ETFs — and for even less money?It may well be possible. And I’m not talking about a high-risk strategy. I’m talking about a low-risk one.I’m talking about doing what ETF fans claim to do, but doing so better, and more cheaply, on your own.Here’s how.As I observed recently in The Wall Street Journal, research has found seven strategies which over time have produced superior returns, with lower risk, than the standard stock market indexes like the S&P 500.Two of them — “focus” investing in stocks you understand really well, and “timing” your investments using some long-term valuation metrics — are best left for another day.But there are five other strategies which are relevant here.The first is investing in “value” stocks — in other words, buying stocks that are cheap in relation to fundamentals such as net assets, sales, cash flow and dividends. It has been accepted for decades that this strategy has beaten the market over time.The second is investing in the stocks of “high quality” companies, meaning companies with strong fundamentals, track records and balance sheets. The evidence is high that the stock market has pretty consistently underappreciated the importance of such quality measures, with the result that those who bought such stocks got a bargain.The third strategy is investing in stocks with the lowest volatility. The conventional wisdom on Wall Street used to be that more volatile stocks were better investments, albeit with more risk. It turns out that over time that hasn’t usually been the case. Quite the reverse.The fourth way of beating the market has been to invest globally, and not just in the U.S. This makes sense, when you think about it. Global investing gives you greater diversification. It improves your chances of buying severely undervalued assets in unfashionable investment destinations. The oft-repeated canard that foreign stocks are “risky” has no justification in theory or practice.The fifth way of beating the index has been, arguably, the simplest: Equal-weight investing. Most ETFs, when you think about it, are built on a contradiction. They tell you to spread your bets across the entire market, but then they pour a disproportionate share of their money into the few stocks with the highest values — Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +0.59%   and Google /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%   and Exxon /quotes/zigman/203975/delayed/quotes/nls/xom XOM +1.00%   and so on. They tell you that all stocks offer the same risk-adjusted prospective returns, and then put more money in the most popular stocks than they do in the bottom 100.This “capitalization-weighted” indexing makes sense for only one reason: It serves the interests of the money management companies, because it is easily scalable and easily manageable.The ETF management companies have been trying to catch up with some of this market-beating research. They have relabeled a lot of the strategies I’ve just described as “Smart Beta” (because heaven forbid that anything should lack a gimmicky name thought up by some clowns in the marketing department), and they have started rolling out new Smart Beta ETFs. So you can now buy “Quality” stock ETFs and “Low Volatility” ETFs. (”Value” ETFs have been around forever.)These are very much a Good Thing, and we should applaud. But here’s how you — or a smart money manager — might go one better.These ETFs base their investments on some standard Smart Beta indexes, such as the MSCI US Quality index.It’s easy to know what’s in these indexes. You can just download the holdings data from the ETFs themselves. So I did so. And then it was the work of a few moments to put them all together into a model portfolio.To put it simply, I scanned for stocks which met all three of these characteristics: Value, Quality, and Low Volatility. I looked at stocks in the U.S., in the developed markets of Europe and the Far East, and in so-called emerging markets as well.I found about fifty stocks worldwide. It was a good spread of countries and industries, too. It included some U.S. household names, such as Johnson & Johnson, Kimberly-Clark, 3M, and Exxon. It included some big names in Europe such as AstraZeneca, Nestlé, Imperial Tobacco, and Swisscom. It included a wide spread of stocks in Asia, from Asustek in Taiwan and Samsung in Korea and Guangdong Investments in China to a couple of banks — Mandiri and Negada — in Indonesia. And it included a few names from further afield, such as Colombia’s Ecopetrol, Brazil’s Tractebel Energia, Russia’s Surgutnetegas, and South Africa’s Tiger Brands.All in all, the list was a little weighted toward telecoms, energy, utilities, and tobacco stocks, but not unduly so. It was reasonably diversified.The final point is that you — or your money manager — could easily buy a representative spread of 30 of these stocks (or even all 50). You could invest equal amounts in each of the stocks, and rebalance every quarter or every year. If you use a discounted online broker each trade will cost you $8, and when you first sign up with your broker you will probably get a whole bunch of trades for free, to build your portfolio. (To keep costs down, you’d best stick to stocks that trade either on a U.S. exchange, including the American Depository Receipts of overseas stocks, or over-the-counter. Many foreign stocks can be traded cheaply and easily from a U.S. brokerage account.)The net result? You’ve got an equally weighted, global portfolio of stocks, all of which are simultaneously high quality, good value and low volatility. That should be a winning investment strategy. It’s a strategy that no ETF on the market duplicates.Oh, and the costs should be low, too. Even if you buy all 50 stocks, and make 50 trades a year, at $8 a pop that’s $400 a year in management costs.On a $100,000 portfolio it’s a very reasonable 0.4%, and the more you invest, the lower the fees. Admittedly it involves a certain amount of work, but hardly too much. You could do the whole thing — download the data, put together a portfolio, and buy the stocks — over coffee.And you don’t need a single ETF.Also see:Is this the perfect investment portfolio?A stock-market forecast with a 14-year winning streakIs Apple really more valuable than all these companies?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=355B2658-FD36-11E3-B93C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Feds Bullard sees inflation above 2% in 2015	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Inflation should move above 2% in 2015 and is likely to spark a heated debate at the U.S central bank about the level of interest rates, said St. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Thursday. Inflation is now turning around and should move over 2% in 2015, Bullard said in an interview on the Fox Business Network. The Fed will have to play its cards right to keep inflation contained, he said. Bullard said the market was right to look past the weak first quarter gross domestic product report. He said that the economy looks pretty good with the unemployment rate declining faster than expected. Bullard said he doesnt see a bubble anywhere in the economy but said the central bank needed to be vigilant.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F686EC3B-EE13-4992-8909-F9EC07D86E80&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Jobless claims still near post-recession low	By Jeffry Bartash, MarketWatchInitial jobless claims fell by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 312,000 in the seven days ended June 21, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected claims to total 310,000.The average of new claims over the past month edged up by 2,000 to 314,250. The monthly figure smooths out the jumpiness in the weekly report and offers a better look at underlying trends in a U.S. labor market that has been steadily improving.The economy has added an average of 214,000 jobs a month through the first five months of the year, one of the best stretches of hiring since the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009. And economists predict the U.S. likely added 220,000 in June, with the government’s official tally being released on July 3.Meanwhile, continuing claims increased by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 2.57 million in the week ended June 14, the Labor Department said. Continuing claims reflect the number of people already receiving benefits and are reported with a one-week delay.Initial claims from two weeks ago were revised up to 314,000 from 312,000.Yellen arrives at a crossroads, and it’s decision timeConsumers splurge on cars in May, but not much else5 (more) cheap stocks in the No. 1 energy sector	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5957DFB8-FD24-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26
Malaysia Flight 370 likely on autopilot for hours	By David Winning and Daniel StaceyThe conclusion was reached by studying transmission data between the plane and a telecommunications satellite owned by Inmarsat PLC, which showed it taking a straight course over thousands of miles before it likely ran out of fuel on March 8, said Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.Dolan said it isn’t clear how the plane’s autopilot function became operational some time after it passed by the tip of Sumatra in Indonesia, but typically it would involve either the pilot or a crew member switching it on. Investigators believe the plane was probably on autopilot when it made each of seven ping transmissions to the Inmarsat satellite.It isn’t the first time that Dolan has raised the possibility that the plane was likely on autopilot. In mid-April, he told the Wall Street Journal that the plane may have been on a flight path toward the Western Australian city of Perth and traveling on autopilot when it is believed to have crashed with 239 people on board.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=BB9B0512-FD31-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26
Puerto Rico moves to refinance its debt	By Aaron KuriloffPuerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla proposed legislation Wednesday that would allow some debt-laden public entities to restructure their bonds. The proposed bill doesn’t include a way for the island’s general-obligation bonds and sales-tax debt to be restructured.The step, if approved, would be the first significant move since the Puerto Rico government hired advisers this year to help it find a way to turn around its utilities, which are heavily indebted and face mounting deficits. The island, which has about $70 billion in obligations, has labored under rising unemployment and declining tax revenue.The year-old administration of Gov. Padilla has been trying to jump-start the economy, eliminate budget deficits and reassure investors that the U.S. commonwealth’s fiscal position is improving.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C00F08C8-FD31-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Richmond Feds Lacker: Unemployment rate is accurate reflection of slack	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said Thursday that the unemployment rate is a reasonably accurate reflection of the current amount of slack in the labor market. He said while the unemployment rate doesnt capture all the people who are potentially employable, not everyone is equally likely to find a job. There is more slack than indicated by the standard unemployment rate, but there always is, and there seems to be no more additional slack now than is typically associated with the current level of the unemployment rate, Lacker said. Other Fed officials, notably Chairwoman Janet Yellen, have said the current rate understates the amount of slack in the labor market. Lacker, known as one of the more hawkish members, becomes a voter on the Federal Open Market Committee in 2015.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=56EFDB88-64CF-434A-8947-D3993AD4BA1E&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

PCE inflation index hits highest rate since Oct 2012	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The governments PCE index rose in May to its highest 12-month rate since October 2012, further evidence that inflationary pressures continue to build. The personal consumption expenditure index rose 0.2% in May, as did the core rate that strips out food and energy. Over the past 12 months, the PCE index has climbed 1.8%, up from 1.6% in April and just 0.8% as recently as February. The core PCE index, for its part, has risen to a 1.5% rate in the period from May 2013 to May 2014. Thats the highest rate since February 2013. The Federal Reserve has been trying to boost inflation closer to the 2% mark because the central bank believes it would be beneficial to the economy. Yet the Fed might have to raise interest rates sooner than it planned unless the increasing pace of inflation starts to moderate in the near future.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=88369F2F-2EF4-4082-A231-C8D6DB3B96B3&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Consumers splurge on cars in May, but not much else	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Consumer spending in the U.S. rose modestly in May, with Americans splurging on new cars and trucks but not much else. Spending edged up a seasonally adjusted 0.2% last month after no change in April. Personal income, meanwhile, rose a sharper 0.4%, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast 0.4% gains in both consumer spending and income. Since incomes rose faster than spending, the personal savings rate climbed to 4.8% from 4.5%, marking the highest level in eight months. Also, inflation as gauged by the PCE price index increased by 0.2% in May, and its up 1.8% in the past 12 months. Thats the fastest year-over-year increase since late 2012, further evidence that prices pressures continue to build, though inflation is still on the low side. In April, consumer spending was flat instead of falling 0.1% as previously reported. Incomes were unchanged at a 0.3% increase.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A23BB6B1-F5B3-4F56-B150-092271CA69FE&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26
Jobless claims edge lower, still near postrecession low	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The number of people who applied for U.S. unemployment benefits last week fell slightly and remained near a post-recession low, the government reported Thursday. Initial jobless claims dipped by 2,000 to 312,000 in the week ended June 21, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by MarketWatch expected claims to total 310,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis. The average of new claims over the past month edged up by 2,000 to 314,250. The monthly figure smooths out the jumpiness in the weekly report and offers a better look at underlying trends in the labor market, which has steadily improved through the first five months of 2014. Also, the government said continuing claims increased by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 2.57 million in the week ended June 14. Continuing claims reflect the number of people already receiving benefits. Initial claims from two weeks ago, meanwhile, were revised up to 314,000 from 312,000.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E490B26F-425F-4B0D-AD6B-F873BA20C62A&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26
Google starts scrubbing Europe search results	By Sam SchechnerGoogle Inc. said Thursday that it has started removing results from its search engine under Europe’s new “right to be forgotten,” implementing a landmark May ruling by the European Union’s top court that gives individuals the right to request removal of results that turn up in Internet searches for their own names.Google /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%  engineers overnight updated the company’s technical infrastructure to start implementing the removals, and Thursday began sending the first emails to individuals informing them that links they had requested were being taken down. Only a small number of the initial wave of requests has been processed.“This week we’re starting to take action on the removals requests that we’ve received,” a Google spokesman said. “This is a new process for us. Each request has to be assessed individually, and we’re working as quickly as possible to get through the queue.”As of nearly a month ago, Google had received more than 41,000 removal requests via a web form it had set up in response to the ruling, which said Google must weigh individuals’ right to privacy against a public interest in having certain information available.The ruling caused a round of consternation inside Google and among free-speech advocates in the U.S., who argued that it could enable censorship and put Google in a difficult position as an arbiter of what people have a right to know. But privacy activists said the reactions were overblown because results would only be removed from individual name searches, not from all of Google’s search results.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Yellen needs to focus more on inflation, less on jobs3 market trends that will change your money habitsJurgen Klinsmann has your excuse to go watch the big game	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=D27E2152-FD2B-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

ConAgra fourth-quarter revenue beats expectations	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- ConAgra Foods Inc. /quotes/zigman/222950/delayed/quotes/nls/cag CAG +1.80% said Thursday it swung to a loss of $324.2 million, or 77 cents a share, in the fiscal fourth quarter from a year-earlier profit of $192.2 million, or 46 cents a share. Adjusted per-share earnings fell to 55 cents from 60 cents. Net sales fell 2.8% to $4.44 billion from $4.56 billion a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected per-share earnings of 58 cents on sales of $4.42 billion. We are disappointed with fiscal 2014 overall, and we have a very focused sense of urgency directed toward improving our results, said Gary Rodkin, ConAgra Foods chief executive. ConAgra said it plans to continue its $1 a share annual dividend and expects to reduce debt by about $1 billion in fiscal 2015. The food company said it expects per-share earnings to grow at a mid-single digit rate in fiscal year 2015, with an expected high-single digit rate of annual per-share earnings growth in fiscal 2016 and 2017. ConAgra shares rose 0.9% premarket.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A8F36529-5955-45D9-BAFC-BA1970D4C3A4&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

How to help your family without blowing your savings	It’s a common predicament. Nearly half of adults in their 40s and 50s have a parent age 65 or older and are either raising a young child or financially supporting a grown child of 18 or older, according to the Pew Research Center. About one in seven middle-aged adults, or 15%, is providing financial support to both an aging parent and a child.And yet, “very few people plan for caregiving responsibilities,” said Scott Halliwell, a certified financial planner with USAA.It’s human nature not to cope with these challenges until the moment they arrive, since anticipating them means acknowledging that things might not go as hoped. It doesn’t help that the financial-planning industry has historically been more focused on investment returns than on helping people navigate intergenerational dynamics, even those that involve money. What’s more, most members of the sandwich generation are so busy that they can’t imagine carving out time to make a plan.Despite these roadblocks, it’s important to create some kind of budget for the sandwich squeeze, experts say. Ideally, you’ll start thinking about your ability to help before the need arises, but if not then at least you can address the issue head-on when it does.Otherwise, you may be putting your own retirement in jeopardy without even realizing it. Those who set some parameters for their support are less likely to compromise their future health and wealth, experts say.Whether you’re supporting a grown child, aging parents, or both, know how much assistance you can afford to give. If possible, your support should come out of your monthly cash flow, said Suzanna de Baca, vice president of wealth strategies at Ameriprise Financial. That’s much better than taking a withdrawal or loan from your 401(k)—the former is subject to ordinary income tax and a 10% penalty if withdrawn before age 59 and a half, while the latter must be repaid with interest. And taking on debt to help a relative can also hurt you in the long run.If you’re considering lowering your monthly contribution to your 401(k), recognize how that might affect your retirement down the line. A financial adviser can work these projections for you. Those who don’t have a financial adviser can experiment with the online retirement calculators, such as this one from MarketWatch, lowering the contribution amount and seeing how that affects your projected nest egg at a designated age. Don’t reduce your contributions below the level at which you get your full company 401(k) match, because that’s leaving free money on the table.Those with limited resources to both support and save should take a careful look at where their money goes each month, de Baca said. To do this, track everything you spend for three months. (This time frame is important because certain payments, such as quarterly insurance bills, don’t occur each month.) Yes, it’s a tedious exercise, but there are desktop and smartphone tools that can help.“Not to beat the latte horse to death,” de Baca said, but sometimes it really is the little expenses that add up and strain your finances. If you cut out your daily Starbucks run and eat out once a month instead of once a week, that might free up $100 to pay your child’s cellphone bill, and another $100 to help your parent with prescription-drug costs.Part of this exercise could involve evaluating your current service plans, to see if there’s room to cut back. Maybe adding your child to a family cellphone plan is cheaper than paying her individual bill. Maybe you pay for 300 cable stations and only watch 10.Accounting for your monthly expenses will also help you discuss the parameters of help with your loved one. If you sit down with a spreadsheet and say, “I’ve calculated that I have $500 per month available to help you; let’s decide together how we should allocate that,” it helps take the emotion out of the discussion, de Baca said.The unemployment rate for those 20 to 24 years old is 11.1%, versus 6.3% for all ages combined. And recent college graduates lucky enough to find employment might not have a job that allows them to support themselves completely. In 2012, 36% of young adults ages 18 to 31 were living in their parents’ home, according to the Pew Research Center.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=6DA49210-FBD3-11E3-AE23-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26
Moodys upgrades California to Aa3; outlook stable	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Moodys Investors Service on Wednesday raised Californias debt rating to Aa3 from A1 and assigned a stable outlook. The upgrade reflects the states rapidly improving financial position, high but declining debt metrics, adjusted net pension liability ratios that are close to the state median, strong liquidity, and robust employment growth, said the ratings agency. The move affects about $86 billion in outstanding debt. California Treasurer Bill Lockyer credited the ratings upgrade to the states ongoing spending cuts, stronger cash flow and tax increases.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=706D9B3C-D760-425F-B509-8D20383BA758&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25
Iron Mountain gets approval to become REIT	By Maria ArmentalIron Mountain /quotes/zigman/254833/delayed/quotes/nls/irm IRM -0.28%  had been waiting for IRS approval to convert to REIT status since July 2012. The move will be effective for the taxable year that began Jan. 1.Shares surged 25% to $36.15 in premarket trade.Last year the IRS stepped up its scrutiny of some companies that were looking to avoid some corporate taxes by converting their operations into real-estate investment trusts. Iron Mountain and a number of other companies received notice from the agency that they were subject to the review.Under the new corporate structure, Iron Mountain expects per-share earnings for the year to increase to $1.52, from its earlier view of $1.03 to $1.14, and annual dividends of $400 million to $420 million, up from $207 million.REITs, created by Congress as a way of giving small investors access to the commercial real-estate market and helping landlords diversify their investor base, pay no corporate income tax as long as they earn the bulk of their profits from rent and distribute at least 90% of their income to shareholders as dividend payments.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Yellen at a crossroads -- now it’s decision time3 market trends that will change your money habits5 (more) cheap stocks in the No. 1 energy sector	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9ADF6318-FD27-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Kevin Warsh: Fed policy is reverse Robin Hood	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- The Federal Reserves easy-money policies are benefiting the rich at the expense of the poor in a reverse Robin Hood scenario, said Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Federal Reserve System Board of Governors. In an interview on CNBC Thursday, Warsh, who is currently a fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution, criticized the central banks current low-rate policies, which he said are nearly as strong as they were during the depths of the crisis. He suggested that normalizing interest rates would help jump-start business investment and speed up economic growth. Warsh said that We need to get a normal-looking interest-rate curve, adding that the Fed needs to overcome the sense that its stuck in a zero-rate environment.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=959FFB30-2DD3-4B4E-A036-21D14B662902&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Yellen arrives at a crossroads, and it’s decision time	By Howard GoldJohnson’s song “Cross Road Blues” was immortalized by guitar god Eric Clapton. It’s a powerful metaphor for a momentous decision that changes your life forever.Now Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen is herself approaching a crossroads. And the stakes are also very high: the health of the markets and the U.S. economy over the next few years.To succeed, Yellen will have to engineer the end of the Fed’s extraordinary bond buying (quantitative easing) and start raising short-term interest rates as the economy improves. Eventually she’ll also have to shrink the central bank’s bloated balance sheet that $3 trillion and several rounds of QE have bought.First of all, don’t believe the gloom-and-doomers: QE3 will be history by year-end. But then the Fed boss will have to begin a carefully calibrated effort to “normalize” interest rates (a term she often uses) after years in which the federal funds rate was stuck near zero.For the past five years, she and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, have told Congress, the media and the public that the overwhelming problem is slow growth and unacceptably high unemployment.“Unless the economy begins to grow more quickly than it has recently, the unemployment rate is likely to remain far above levels consistent with maximum employment for some time,” Bernanke said at Jackson Hole, Wyo., in August 2012.“Even with recent declines in the unemployment rate, it continues to be elevated [and] a substantial amount of slack remains in the labor market,” Yellen testified before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress in May.But now, amid clear signs the economy is recovering, Yellen and the Fed face a different challenge. While continuing to fret over the “weakness” of the labor market and even encouraging some short-term inflation, they will have to keep underlying inflation from getting out of hand.Because after a long period in which inflation was subdued or even nonexistent, it’s beginning to return. The consumer price index rose by an annualized 2.1% in May, food prices have seen their biggest increase in three years, and oil prices have jumped along with the turmoil in Iraq. Crude, of course, could tumble with a change of fortune in the Middle East. But it looks as if overall prices are rising again.That’s actually good news, because along with strong consumer confidence and soaring new-home sales reported Tuesday, it suggests a real recovery is under way and weak first-quarter GDP was likely a one-off.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8628D95E-FC9B-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

U.S., wary of war, will let regional players sort Iraq	By Reva BhallaThe following year, however, the Soviets published the Sykes-Picot agreement, planting the seeds for Arab insurrection and further ensuring that Europe’s imperialist rule over the Middle East would ever be anything but easy.Nearly a century later, with Sunni jihadists seizing a belt of territory spanning Syria and Iraq, colonial designs for Mesopotamia are being mocked once again. A week ago, jihadists with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) bulldozed through an earthen berm forming Iraq’s northern border with Syria. As #SykesPicotOver trended on jihadist Twitter feeds, U.S.-made, Iraqi-army-owned and now jihadist-purloined Humvees streamed southward through the breach, reigniting the Middle East and sending international powers scrambling for a strategy.Whether by mere coincidence, strategic design or a blend of the two, there will be as many winners as there are losers in the Iraq game. Russia knows this game well. The United States, the heir to the Sykes-Picot map, must learn it fast. However, more mindful of the region’s history this time around and fatigued by a decade of war, the U.S. will seek to leave it to the regional players to prevent a jihadist mini-emirate from forming.Turkey’s dilemmaStruggling to insulate itself from the jihadist threat and pursue its strategic interests in Iraqi Kurdistan, Turkey has forged an alliance with the Iraqi Kurdish leadership in a direct challenge to Baghdad’s authority. With Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki relying on Kurdish peshmergas to fend off jihadists in the north, Ankara and Arbil have gained some leverage in their ongoing dispute with Baghdad over the distribution of energy revenue.However, while Turkey had planned to use a tighter relationship with the Kurdistan Regional Government to exploit northern Iraq’s energy reserves and to manage Kurdish unrest within its own boundaries, Ankara never intended to underwrite Kurdish independence. And with Kirkuk now in Kurdish hands as a result of the jihadist surge, the largest oil field in northern Iraq stands ready to fuel Kurdish secessionist tendencies. Much to Turkey’s dismay, Kurdish militants from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party and the People’s Protection Units are already reinforcing peshmerga positions in northern Iraq. Meanwhile, ISIL and its jihadist affiliates are holding 80 Turkish citizens hostage.Thus, Turkey will enlarge its footprint in Mesopotamia, though not necessarily on its own terms. Some 1,500 to 2,000 Turkish forces have maintained a quiet presence in Iraqi Kurdistan. That force will likely expand now that Turkey has an array of threats to justify such a presence and a growing need to temper Kurdish ambitions. Iraq’s Kurdish leadership will be reminded of their deep distrust for Turkey but will also be overwhelmed by its own challenges, not least of which is Turkey’s main regional competitor, Iran.Iran’s challengeOver the past several months, Iran has been expanding its military presence along its northern border with Iraq. Unnerved by Turkey’s increasingly assertive Kurdish policy and possibly anticipating the jihadist resurgence across Iraq’s Sunni belt, Tehran is having to reinforce its Shiite allies in Iraq militarily. Though Iran has perhaps the most sophisticated and extensive militant proxy network in the region, this strategy carries enormous risks.Iran has spent the recent years consolidating Shiite influence in Iraq under a central authority in Baghdad. Tehran has never been wedded to al-Maliki in particular, but it needed influence in the capital to be able to manage the country’s fractious Shiite landscape. Employing Shiite militias allows Iran to reinforce the Iraqi army, but it risks undermining Iran’s ability to manage Iraq firmly over the long term. The more empowered the militias and the weaker Baghdad becomes, the harder Iran will have to work to contain separatist moves in the Shiite south.Deeper Iranian involvement in the conflict will motivate Arab Sunni fighters of various ideological stripes to take up arms against their historical Persian foes and their Arab Shiite allies. A spike in sectarian violence would also make it all the more difficult for Iraq’s Shiite government to recruit enough allies among Iraq’s Sunni population to fight against the jihadists. Indeed, ISIL would not have been able to mount its lightning surge across Iraq had it not been for the substantial support it has received from local Sunni tribes who, in turn, receive substantial support and guidance from sponsors in the Persian Gulf — say, the Saudi royals maneuvering quietly in Riyadh.Please see the next page for Saudi Arabia’s involvement.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E3571970-FC90-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Most Chinese worried about prices, afraid of real estate	By Laura He, MarketWatchA 56.5% majority of Chinese urban residents thought prices were “high or unacceptable,” up from 55.8% in the first quarter, according to the results of a survey published Wednesday by the People’s Bank of China.The quarterly survey gathers perspectives of 20,000 bank depositors in 50 major Chinese cities on consumer prices, income levels, investment preferences and general economic conditions.Two out of three said they were upset about surging property prices, with 63% responding that current housing prices are “high or unacceptable,” although this was at least 1.3 percentage point lower than those complaining of home prices in the first quarter.Understandably then, more people are turning to alternative investment options, such as bonds. During the second quarter, only 14% of respondents said they invested in real estate, down from 16.2% in the first quarter. Meanwhile, 16.4% bought bonds, and 30.9% chose “funds and investment products”, compared with 13.7% and 31.8%, respectively, in the first quarter.But on the downside, the number of those seeing their income falling — usually a small minority — is creeping higher. Of those surveyed, 83.3% believed their incomes had either “increased” or “stayed basically the same,” down from 85.9% in the first quarter and 85.3% in the same period last year.Similarly, a growing number of urban Chinese are worried about their future income, with the proportion of those indicating confidence dropping to 51.6% from 53% in the first quarter.Asia Stocks blog: Up and at ‘emBarnes & Noble’s new Samsung Nook tablets to debut in AugustHollywood’s own ‘Top 100′ film list offers some surprises	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9B78FF78-FCF0-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26
China pulling the plug on IBM, Oracle, others	By Li Xiaoxiao, Qin Min, Zhang Yuzhe, Nan Hao, Qu Yunxu and Zheng PeishanThe movement has taken special aim at products made by the American companies IBM Corp. /quotes/zigman/230066/delayed/quotes/nls/ibm IBM +0.07%  , Oracle Corp. /quotes/zigman/19452757/delayed/quotes/nls/orcl ORCL +0.95%  and EMC Corp. /quotes/zigman/225273/delayed/quotes/nls/emc EMC +0.82%   — a tripartite powerhouse with deep roots in corporate IT departments across China.Domestic rivals of these companies such as Huawei Technology Co. /quotes/zigman/2339927/realtime CN:002502 +10.03%  and Inspur Co. /quotes/zigman/1866474/delayed CN:000977 +4.94%   /quotes/zigman/23388889/delayed HK:0596 +2.92%  are winning contracts from state company and bank IT departments at an accelerating rate. Some companies, such as e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, have been building internal computer networks with open-source software and commonly available hardware.The movement dates to 2008, when Alibaba’s computer-network department director Wang Jian proposed cutting back on foreign suppliers and replacing their wares with equipment and technology developed almost entirely in-house.What Wang wanted to get rid of most was the so-called IOE system, an acronym for an IT network based on the names of three suppliers: IBM, whose servers are packaged with the Unix operating system; Oracle, which supplies database-management systems; and EMC, the maker of data-storage hardware. Wang dubbed his campaign the “De-IOE Movement.”Wang decided to revamp Alibaba’s network by replacing its Unix-based servers with less expensive, X86-based PC servers running on the open-source Linux operating system. In such a system, several PCs with X86 microprocessors inside can be linked in a chain to function as a server, replacing a mainframe server. The e-commerce company also built a database management-system of its own with an open-source structure, and started storing data on an internal cloud-storage system.Alibaba thus followed in the footsteps of other major Internet companies such as Amazon /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN +1.39% , Google /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%   /quotes/zigman/93888/delayed/quotes/nls/googl GOOGL +0.39%  and Facebook /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB -0.24% , which earlier built their own computing networks.De-IOE Movement milestones were reached in May 2013 when Alibaba pulled the plug on its last IBM server, and two months later when Alibaba’s advertising department abandoned its Oracle database. The rest of the company’s databases are scheduled to switch to a homegrown system from Oracle’s by 2015.IT departments at companies and banks across the country are now following Alibaba’s example — and hitting their longtime American suppliers in the pocketbook.The switch to servers made at home has been a slow process for Chinese banks. Ultimately, the banks’ IT experts have been making these decisions, although they’re being encouraged by the government to choose Chinese suppliers, according to a source close to the China Banking Regulatory Commission.The now-famous 2013 revelations involving former U.S. computer-security expert Edward Snowden, who blew the whistle on government espionage, gave a boost to proponents of the De-IOE campaign.But the switch is not happening overnight. A Bank of China /quotes/zigman/35803/delayed HK:3988 +1.41%   /quotes/zigman/529024/delayed/quotes/nls/bachy BACHY +1.41%   /quotes/zigman/1873420/delayed CN:601988 0.00%  IT department employee said some Chinese suppliers have yet to meet the security and stability standards that are required of any bank computer network working with customer accounts. Moreover, he said, a system overhaul can carry a high price tag. BOC already spends more than 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) on IT.“It’s not easy for major banks to change their core systems, due to high replacement costs,” said the employee, who asked not to be named.IOE systems have been commonly used in Chinese banks since the late 1990s, and are at the heart of the IT networks driving 70% of the world’s banks and other financial institutions.The rise of Internet banking is spurring major banks to explore new IT options and cut back on IOE systems. A source at a state bank noted, however, that basic computing for customer accounts still relies on IOE systems.In 2007, according to a survey that year by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and Ministry of Finance, less than 2% of the IT equipment operating at major financial institutions nationwide had been supplied by Chinese companies.Homegrown servers were slowly introduced over the next five years. Banks then picked up the pace after the State Council, China’s cabinet, issued guidelines for protecting sensitive data in the name of national security. An increasing number of bankers decided to follow these guidelines by reducing their reliance on IOE systems.What security risks are posed by IOE systems? According to an official at the People’s Bank of China, one risk is that IT employees at a Chinese bank might fail to detect technical problems in a product that is made by a foreign company. Moreover, he said, political friction between China and other countries, such as the United States, could affect contracts with IOE suppliers.Additional changes will not happen overnight, partly because the IOE companies as well as America’s Microsoft Corp. /quotes/zigman/20493/delayed/quotes/nls/msft MSFT -0.24%  and Hewlett-Packard Co. /quotes/zigman/229301/delayed/quotes/nls/hpq HPQ +0.35%   offer customers integrated solutions that make it difficult to replace individual pieces of equipment or software. An IT consultant who advises banks said IBM, for example, is so entrenched that China’s banks would likely need about 20 years to replace all IOE systems.“Getting rid of IOE means that all of the software must be moved and made compatible to domestic server systems, which seems to be a mission impossible,” said the consultant.Big banks are thus moving cautiously, said the BOC employee, because they want to protect their huge customer and transaction databases. They cannot afford to be hasty because replacing one part of a network can affect others.And replacement costs can be astronomical. “The basic technology networks for an IOE system and a ‘De-IOE’ system are totally different,” said another source a state bank. “De-IOE will lead to transforming personnel and management. It’s hard to estimate how high the costs will be.”Ultimately, said the IT consultant, Chinese banks will only manage to kill off IOE systems if products made by Chinese suppliers can provide comparable security and capacity levels, and if the new hardware and software are compatible.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0B42D2AA-FCDF-11E3-B93C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26
Asia Stocks live blog: Up and at em	Welcome to the Asia Stocks live blog, a running account of what the region’s share markets are doing, along with other news. Today, while Wall Street offers Asian investors a positive lead, equities action may prove cautious ahead of key data out tomorrow and early next week.For a long time, Japan Inc. has kept a tight grip on its corporate treasuries. Really, Carl Icahn would have an ulcer from investing in some of these companies: In 2003-2013, for example, large Japanese companies offered an average return on equity of just 6%, compared to almost 14% in the U.S. and above 12% worldwide.But this appears to be changing for a number of reasons.For one thing, Japanese corporations are sitting on more cash than they have in the past. Also, new reforms under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government are offering more of a voice to institutional investors. And a record number of foreign investors, raised on a diet of buybacks and dividends, are now in the Tokyo market.Read Megumi Fujikawa’s piece for The Wall Street Journal on how Japan’s corporate philosophy on channeling money back to shareholders.Here comes Japan’s stock market, swinging higher after yesterday’s pullback, even in the face of a slightly stronger yen.The Nikkei Average is up 0.4% in early moves (it fell 0.7% on Wednesday), matched by a 0.4% rise for the Topix, helped a good session for U.S. stocks overnight.While the Japanese currency is up a little from this time yesterday (dollar at ¥101.81 vs. ¥101.94), some of the big exporters are climbing, even if volume is a little on the lighter side.Some of the top advancers are among Japan’s best-known names, favored by foreign investors who have recently been buyers in this market. Panasonic is up 1.2%, Hitachi is up 2.1%, Fujitsu is up 3.8%, and among the telecoms, Sprint-owner Softbank is up 0.9% and KDDI is up 2%.In terms of news events moving shares, NEC is up 1.5% after S&P flagged the company’s debt for a possible upgrade due to growing profit and cash flow, and Yahoo Japan is up 1.9% on a Nikkei report that it will invest in a credit-card-company spinoff to boost its online payment business.Meanwhile, stock in e-commerce major Rakuten are rocking a 3.3% gain as CNBC cites local reports as saying the company may join forces with AirAsia to enter the low-cost airline business. And to boot, Rakuten has also announced the opening of a new development and operations center in India.On the other hand, Toyota’s declaration that it will launch a new hydrogen-powered fuel-cell car in Japan by next March is doing little for its stock price, up 0.3% in early moves.As for the decliners, energy shares are mostly lower after a drop for Brent crude-oil futures, with JX Holdings down 0.4%, and Inpex off 0.3%.It’s a good morning for those long Australian stocks, as the ASX 200 rises 0.4%, with gains spread across most sectors after a strong lead from U.S. markets.Two of Sydney’s most pivitol stock groups — banks and miners — are both generally higher, with the latter benefiting from some overnight gains for commodities.Specifically, Rio Tinto is up 0.6%, Fortescue Metals is up 1.4%, Oz Minerals is up 0.5%, Newcrest is up 1.2%, and in the financial space, Westpac is up 1.2%, ANZ and NAB are each up 0.6%, and CBA is 0.4% higher.Meanwhile, deal news is stirring some issues. Shares of AGL Energy are up 3% after getting regulatory approval to buy Macquarie Generation assets, with the government’s OK also generating a Credit Suisse upgrade for AGL to neutral from underperform.Shares of Seek are 1.7% higher, with Deutsche Bank saying its plan to buy Malaysia’s JobStreet will happen, though Seek may need to raise its price. Nonetheless, Deutsche Bank still rates Seek as a buy.And Morgan Stanley has raised its price target for Treasury Wine Estates, as it thinks rival bids to an offer from KKR will likely emerge, Treasury Wine is currently 1.4% higher.Tokyo (Nikkei Average) up 0.2%Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) up 0.6%Seoul (Kospi) up 0.5%As with the other big Asian markets, Hong Kong shares are trending higher this morning on the back of a strong showing overnight on Wall Street. At this point, we have the Hang Seng Index up 0.6%, and the Hong Kong H shares 0.9% higher in light of a 0.5% improvement over on the Shanghai bourse.The closely watched real-estate sector is mostly solid, with Sun Hung Kai Properties up 0.8%, Hang Lung Properties up 1.1%, and New World Development up 1.9%.Among the category’s few decliners, China Overseas Land & Investment is 1% weaker, and while there are no big, screaming headlines to pin the move to, the name is often mentioned as one being sold by investors seeking to buy into China Vanke’s Hong Kong debut. China Vanke, the nation’s biggest developer, ended flat on its first day of Hong Kong trading yesterday, but the shares are up 0.6% this morning.Among the financials, it’s the second-tier names that are enjoying the strongest advances, with Hang Seng Bank up 1.3%, and China Citic Bank up 1.5%. As for their larger peers, ICBC is up 0.4%, while Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank are all 0.9% higher.Energy is also a strong spot, with Cnooc and PetroChina up 1.3% each, while utility China Gas is rallying 4.9% after issuing results and scoring a target-price hike from Daiwa.And miners too are enjoying a lift, with coal extractor China Shenhua rising 1.6%, and Jiangxi Copper up 1% after gains for the metal overnight.On the downside, Lenovo is 0.6% weaker as The Wall Street Journal reports the computer maker’s plan to buy IBM’s server business has hit a snag in the form of U.S. national-security concerns about the deal.Tokyo (Nikkei Average) up 0.3% (at break)Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) up 0.9%Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) up 0.6%Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) up 0.8%Seoul (Kospi) up 0.5%Taipei (Taiex) up 0.8%Tokyo (Nikkei Average) up 0.2%Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) up 0.9%Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) up 0.5% (at break)Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) up 0.7%Seoul (Kospi) up 0.4%Mumbai (Sensex) down 0.1%Taipei (Taiex) up 0.8%Chinese e-commerce companies and banks are scrapping their U.S.-made mainframe servers and related software in favor of homegrown brands, partly because of price and partly because of politics, according to a new Caixin report.The biggest losers in the trend are Oracle, EMC and IBM (which is set to sell its server business to China’s Lenovo), while Chinese rivals such as Huawei Tech and Inspur look set to gain.But while this may seem a purely political move in the ongoing U.S.-China game of oneupsmanship, there’s a price factor as well: By switching to domestic hardware using open-source systems, Chinese firms and government agencies can save big.And yet, the price consideration also shows why China won’t be able to completely rid itself of IBM anytime soon. It seems that switching servers is very expensive, as a host of other systems and the people who run them need to accommodate such changes.Read the full story in this Caixin Online report.The average Chinese city dweller is upset with rising prices and is still shying away from what was once the national pastime — real-estate investing.A 56.5% majority of Chinese urban residents thought prices were “high or unacceptable,” up from 55.8% in the first quarter, according to the results of a survey published Wednesday by the People’s Bank of China.Two out of three said they were upset about surging property prices, with 63% responding that current housing prices are “high or unacceptable,” although this was at least 1.3 percentage point lower than those complaining of home prices in the first quarter.Check more in this MarketWatch story.Tokyo (Nikkei Average) up 0.3% (closed)Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) up 1.5% (closed)Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) up 0.7% (closed)Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) up 1.2% (closed)Seoul (Kospi) up 0.7% (closed)Taipei (Taiex) up 0.9% (closed)The Tell is MarketWatch’s fast and engaging look at trends and themes in the day’s markets.

Google’s smartwatch demo: still early days	By Therese Poletti, MarketWatchAll the Google /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%  presenters appeared to be wearing a large black smartwatch, and when it was worn by one of the rare women developers on stage, it looked exceedingly large and ugly. During the demos, the large displays of the text on the face of the watch that appeared on the screen above the stage looked shaky and blurry. But the features included syncing the watch with your smartphone and displaying texts, emails and other notifications, based on your geographical location and scheduled events, such as an impending airplane reservation.Google executives noted in their demonstrations that having a smartwatch synced with your phone would also let people stay better engaged with what they are doing or with each other. On average people check their Android phones about 125 times a day. You can talk into the watch or swipe it.Developers cheered when they learned they would be getting a free smartwatch, either an LG Electronics G Watch or a Samsung Electronics Gear Live. For consumers, the LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live, are available to order on Google’s Play store. The Moto 360 from Motorola will be available in the next few months.The demo was just one of a number of software developer announcements, showing how Google plans to infiltrate even more aspects of our lives, from the car to your house to your body. The biggest entertainment came, not via an fantastic demo by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who was missing from the keynote, but from two protesters who tried to interrupt the speakers on stage.Still, the overall impression was that wearable computing may for now, appeal only to the early adopters, but Google, like Apple Inc. /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +0.59%  is laying the groundwork for a big battle.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=2287CD6A-FC9B-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25
Treasurys pare gains after five-year note auction	By Saumya Vaishampayan, MarketWatchThe Treasury Department sold $35 billion in five-year notes at a yield of 1.670%. Bidders offered to buy 2.74 times the amount of debt sold, versus an average of 2.75 times at the last six sales.Indirect bidders, a group that includes foreign central banks, bought 52.5% versus 44.6% in recent sales. The high level of indirect bids was likely due to short covering, since the five-year note has “become a favorite for shorts,” said Stanley Sun, an interest-rate strategist at Nomura.While the end game for the bond market is a higher interest-rate environment, the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy statement has once again reminded it that timing is uncertain, he said.“People don’t want to set up their shorts too early, especially in the summer doldrums. You need a catalyst to sell off,” Sun said, adding that the catalyst isn’t likely to come until the Fed’s Jackson Hole retreat or the September Fed meeting.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR 0.00% , which moves inversely with the price, fell 1 basis point to 2.560%. The 30-year Treasury bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR 0.00%  yield declined by 1 basis point to 3.383%, according to FactSet data. One basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.Earlier, data showed the U.S. economy shrunk by 2.9% in the first quarter. That’s the biggest decline since early 2009 and supports the Federal Reserve’s view that accommodative monetary policy is still appropriate.“The upshot is that the GDP hole in Q1 will take longer to dig out of, leaving the Fed somewhat embarrassed by their ‘weather’ explanation for weak growth and certainly making then more guarded on the timing of exit, at least until we have definite bones on the Q2 GDP print,” said Richard Gilhooly, U.S. director of interest-rate strategy at TD Securities, in a note.Also read: Here’s how much the harsh winter cost the U.S. economyThe yield on the five-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR 0.00%  fell 1 basis point to 1.652% and the 7-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868264/delayed 7_YEAR 0.00%  yield also shed 1 basis point to 2.159%.Other economic data released Wednesday included a 1.0% decline in U.S. durable-goods orders.401(k)s face ‘crisis,’ says Nobel-winning economistMonsanto, Barnes & Noble jump; Energy stocks weakenU.S. growth contracted 2.9% in first quarter	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3A37691A-FC74-11E3-B93C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

Dollar falls after ‘surprisingly negative’ GDP	By Saumya Vaishampayan, MarketWatchThe revised first-quarter contraction was the biggest decline since early 2009, and contrasts with the previous estimate of a 1% contraction.The GDP report was “surprisingly negative,” prompting immediate dollar selling, said John Doyle, director of markets at Tempus, Inc.But the dollar has since recovered some of its loss after the initial shock of the data, as investors began to focus on the expected economic rebound in the second quarter. “I don’t think that this one data print is going to change the trajectory of [the Fed’s] taper or rasing of interest rates,” Doyle said.Higher U.S. interest rates would likely accelerate the purchase of U.S. dollars by foreign investors as they try to scoop up higher-yielding dollar-denominated assets.The euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/realtime/sampled EURUSD -0.1088%  rose to $1.3631 from $1.3604 late Tuesday. That’s the highest level since June 6, according to FactSet.Also weighing on the greenback was weaker-than-expected durable-goods report, which showed seasonally adjusted 1% decline in orders for big-ticket items.The dollar /quotes/zigman/4868099/realtime/sampled USDJPY -0.1202%  inched down to ¥101.87 from ¥101.93 late Tuesday.

Stocks rise after walking off downward GDP revision	By Wallace Witkowski and Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatchThe S&P 500 Index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.55% rose 9.55 points, or 0.5%, to end at 1,959.53, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.54% gained 49.38 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 16,867.51.The S&P 500 and Dow both snapped two-day skids, but remain down for the week after closing at record levels on Friday.The Nasdaq Composite Index /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP +0.63% climbed 29.40 points, or 0.7%, to close at 4,379.76, as Google Inc. /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%  kicked off its annual I/O developers conference in San Francisco . The tech-heavy index scored its highest close since April 2000.Orders for durable goods fell 1% in May, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was below the 0.5% expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch.In addition, the U.S. economy shrank by a 2.9% annual pace in the first quarter instead of 1% as previously reported, marking the biggest decline since early 2009 when the Great Recession was winding down. The economy has strengthened since the first quarter, when it was hurt by an unusually harsh winter, with growth projected to rise roughly 3% in the second quarter, which ends Monday.Investors knew the GDP report would “stink, but not this much,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Ava Trade, in emailed comments. But he said he expects “payback” in the current quarter, meaning “a strong reading.”“The initial reaction to the GDP report was exactly that, a kneejerk reaction,” said Dan Greenhaus, BTIG, in emailed comments.Greenhaus pointed out that core durable-goods data, excluding defense spending, was actually good and that even the less closely followed Markit PMI figure was better than expected, indicating the economy is in much better shape than the revised first-quarter GDP data would suggest.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, said Wednesday’s two economic reports reinforce the notion that the Federal Reserve won’t raise interests rates sooner than expected, and he sees stocks staying in a narrow trading range for the summer.“For now, I just think the market holds its own here,” Cardillo told MarketWatch. “I don’t see an interruption of the longer-term bull market, but rather just a pause.”That view of a narrow trading range for the summer was backed by Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank, in a recent note.“Among near-term catalysts, the June employment report scheduled for release on July 3 and second quarter earnings results set largely to begin in the middle of July should set the tone for performance throughout the third quarter and perhaps beyond,” Sandven said.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=D3F0D3B4-FC62-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

SEC charges three former Regions Bank executives with fraud	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Three former bank executives at Regions Bank were charged with fraud on Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said. The senior managers were accused of intentionally misclassifying loans that should have been recorded as impaired for accounting purposes and as a result the company overstated its income and earnings per share in its financial reports. Regions Financial Corp. /quotes/zigman/351634/delayed/quotes/nls/rf RF +1.59% entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the SEC for cooperating with the agencys investigation and will pay $51 million to the SEC, Federal Reserve and the Alabama Department of Banking to resolve parallel action. Thomas A. Neely Jr., who was the principal architect of the scheme while serving as head of Regions Banks risk analytics group in 2009, took intentional steps to circumvent internal accounting controls and improperly classify $168 million in commercial loans. Neely worked with the banks head of special assets Jeffrey C. Kuehr and chief credit officer Michael J. Willoughby on the scheme. The SEC settled with Kuehr and Willoughby for $70,000 each and will be barred from serving as officers at public companies, while Neelys case is still being litigated. Shares for Regions Financial Corporation were up 1%. The SEC also charged two brokers for insider trading ahead of an acquisition by IBM Corporation /quotes/zigman/230066/delayed/quotes/nls/ibm IBM +0.07% of SPSS Inc. in 2009, that led to gains of $300,000.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=62A044A2-9EDC-4281-90F2-7BBD3357ACBD&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

Oil futures log first gain in three sessions	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchPrices saw some pressure during the session after government data early Wednesday showed U.S. durable goods fell by 1% in May and the economy shrank more than previously expected in the first quarter, while U.S. crude inventories rose last week.Crude oil for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.28%  climbed 47 cents, or 0.4%, to settle at $106.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after tapping a high of $107.50 in electronic trading overnight. Just ahead of the government supply data, the contract was at $105.85.U.S. benchmark crude drew some support from a Wall Street Journal article “touting U.S. oil condensate exports,” said Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures. “There may be much less to this story than meets the eye, however, as it appears this was more of an official confirmation that minimally processed condensates are classified as a product under export rules rather than falling under the crude-oil export ban.”“Having released a trade flow, however, it’s hard to put the condensate story genie back in the bottle,” he said in a note.The Wall Street Journal late Tuesday reported that federal officials told two energy companies they can export legally a kind of ultralight oil that has become plentiful as drillers tap shale formations across the U.S. Under current rules, companies can export refined fuel but not oil itself.The new approach, which hasn’t been publicly announced, rebrands some types of ultralight oil as fuel after it has been minimally processed. Read: producers win, refiners lose as U.S. crude-oil export ban dies.Any upside for Nymex crude was capped, however, on the back of weekly petroleum-supply data.Early Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles rose 1.7 million barrels for the week ended June 20. The American Petroleum Institute had said late Tuesday that crude supplies rose 4 million barrels. Analysts surveyed by Platts had forecast a decline of 2 million barrels for crude.Crude stocks at Cushing, Oka., the delivery hub for Nymex futures, climbed by 400,000 barrels to 21.8 million barrels — that was the second increase in 11 weeks, though stocks at the hub were at a 45.2% deficit to the five-year average, according to Platts.Gasoline supplies climbed by 700,000 barrels, while distillate stockpiles rose 1.2 million barrels, according to the EIA. Gasoline stockpiles were expected to climb by 2 million barrels, while distillates, which include heating oil, were seen up 1 million barrels, according to the Platts poll.July gasoline  fell 3 cents, or 1.1%, to $3.09 a gallon, while July heating oil  fell 1 cents, or 0.4%, to $3.03 a gallon.Meanwhile, Brent futures slipped on Iraqi oil exports, which showed no ill effects from the violence sweeping parts of the country as Sunni insurgents clash with government forces.ICE August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -0.38%  fell 46 cents, or 0.4%, to $114 a barrel.Key oil fields and facilities in the south of the country are expected to remain insulated from the fighting, though Brent, which hit a nine-month high above $115 a barrel last week, doesn’t look set to shed its risk premium as long as the violence continues, analysts said.“Brent crude prices have eased off slightly, although this is unlikely to last with U.S. intervention looking increasingly likely,” said Craig Erlam, market analyst at Alpari in London.In the energy-product markets, July natural-gas futures  rose almost 2 cents, or 0.4%, to end at $4.55 per million British thermal units after gaining 2% in the previous session.The EIA will issue its weekly natural-gas supply report on Thursday, with consensus expectations calling for an increase of 101 billion cubic feet to 103 billion cubic feet, according to Citi Futures’ Evans. That would be bearish compared with the 82 billion-cubic-foot five-year average gain, he said.Producers win, refiners lose as U.S. crude-oil export ban diesU.S. set to allow first shipments of unrefined oil overseasIs this the beginning of the end of the bull market?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=239AFC62-FC60-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25
Two brokers charged with insider trading in IBM deal	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) - U.S. prosecutors on Wednesday charged two brokers with trading on inside information ahead of IBMs /quotes/zigman/230066/delayed/quotes/nls/ibm IBM +0.07% acquisition of software company SPSS Inc., which the company bought for $1.2 billion billion in 2009. The SEC simultaneously announced civil charges against the pair, seeking the return of an alleged $300,000 in profits. The Manhattan U.S. district attorney said the former brokers, Benjamin Durant III and Daryl M. Payton, illegally traded based on a tip they received from broker Thomas C. Conradt. The SEC and U.S. Attorney previously charged Conradt, fellow broker David J. Weishaus and research analyst Trent Martin with insider trading on the same tip. The three settled and pled guilty to related charges last year. The pair were arrested at their homes this morning and will appear before a federal judge Wednesday afternoon.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3100999E-9985-4088-887B-426340339C09&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

Oil ends higher for first time in three sessions	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Oil futures on Wednesday saw their first gain in three sessions as traders digested news that the U.S government loosened a ban on crude exports. The market also factored in a fall in U.S. durable goods orders, a downward revision to first quarter GDP and a weekly climb in crude inventories. August crude tacked on 47 cents, or 0.4%, to settle at $106.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B10F0784-FDC9-4911-98E6-444FB58ACFDB&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

CIT’s Thain says regulation no hurdle to doing deals	By Andrew R. JohnsonThe Livingston, N.J.-based company, which provides financing to small and midsize businesses, is one of the few banks that is approaching $50 billion in assets, a threshold at which higher capital standards and enhanced data-reporting requirements kick in for financial institutions. CIT /quotes/zigman/579893/delayed/quotes/nls/cit CIT +0.83%   had $48.6 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter.Thain said during a presentation to investors that CIT is “at least at the moment prepared to go over $50 [billion] and be a” systemically important financial institution-a designation applied to banks above that asset size-if the right deal came along.The former Merrill Lynch CEO has previously said CIT may try to acquire a bank with a small branch network to build out its deposit base, which has become a more crucial source of funding for its loans since the company emerged from bankruptcy in late 2009.If the bank surpasses $50 billion in assets, it would prefer to do so in a substantial way rather than inch over the line, Thain said Wednesday.“Our inclination, if we could find something that was attractive,” would be to “do something bigger rather than smaller,” he said. Thain didn’t specify a specific asset size for potential acquisition targets but said it would not “help us very much” to “buy a $2 billion bank.”An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:GDP data provide new view into a brutal winter’s costsAre drones legal in your state?

This is Rex Crum of MarketWatch (@mktwcrum) and I will be your live-blogging escort for the keynote address from Google’s I/O developers conference in San Francisco today.

David Singleton, director of engineering for Android, is on the stage.Android Wear to support round and square screens. What? No triangles?Android users check their phones an average of 125 times a day, says Singleton.Getting a live demo of an LG smartwatch with Android.We’re seeing a demo of the voice commands with the LG watch. Demo works OK. Speech-recognition needs to be tightened up where the term “peanut butter” is concerned. “Best wearable apps respond to the users context,” Singleton says.How do apps get to the watch? Just by downloading the app from the Google Play store.LG watch to be available to order today on the Google Play store. Samsung Gear Live watch will also be available. Moto 360 available later this summer.Talk now shifts to Android in the car.Announcing Android Auto.Features of Android Auto include voice command of Google Maps.Android Auto developers kit to be published “soon”…Over 40 new automakers have joined the “Open Automotive Alliance”…First cars with Android Auto to roll off the lot later this year.And now…Android in the living room. Today…Google announcing AndroidTV.So, it looks like Android TV is an app for your Android device that organizes your apps and TV content.

Gold logs sixth straight gain	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchGold for August delivery /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.05%  tacked on $1.30, or 0.1%, to settle at $1,322.60 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. July silver /quotes/zigman/698627/delayed SIN4 +0.34%  closed up 7 cents, or 0.4%, at $21.12 an ounce.Prices had spent part of Wednesday’s session on the retreat after having tallied a gain of nearly 4% during the previous five trading sessions. The turn higher was due in part to the first-quarter GDP reading as well as durable-goods order data that filtered through to the currency and U.S. Treasury markets, said Jeffrey Wright, managing director at H.C. Wainwright.The U.S. dollar /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY +0.07%   weakened against the major currencies and along with a rise in Treasury prices, gold responded with an upward move, he said. “We still believe gold is range bound from $1,250 to $1,350 in 2014, just heading towards the upward band of the range over past week.”Gold saw a big move “on the back of the rotten GDP data which was released today,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade. Comex gold traded lower for the session, at around $1,315 before the GDP data and pared losses to tap $1,320 immediately after them.But much of that earlier move was “short lived because bad weather is the major reason for this stinky number, and if such is the case and there is nothing big lingering under this, then we would expect a strong number for the next quarter — a payback time,” Aslam said.Also among the key metals traded on Comex Wednesday, prices for copper continued to inch higher, with the July contract /quotes/zigman/678460/delayed HGN4 -0.21%  ending at $3.17 a pound, up nearly 2 cents, or 0.5%. July platinum /quotes/zigman/15256884/delayed PLN4 -0.19%  climbed $1.30, or 0.1%, to $1,473.20 an ounce, while Sept. /quotes/zigman/18010104/delayed PAU4 +0.37% tacked on $2.85, or 0.3%, to $833.25 an ounce.In afternoon dealings, shares of gold and silver miners rebounded a bit from Tuesday’s decline, with the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index /quotes/zigman/1475600/delayed XAU +0.14%  gaining 0.7%. The SPDR Gold Trust /quotes/zigman/41663/delayed/quotes/nls/gld GLD -0.42%  saw its shares trade up 0.1%.The beginning of the end of the bull market?10 stock-market laggards that could get huge M&A boostAre drones legal in your state?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=D74CB622-FC67-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

SEC halts bond offering of Chicago suburb	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission has received an emergency court order to halt a bond offering of a Chicago suburb. The SEC said it has filed fraud charges in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the city of Harvey, Ill., and Joseph T. Letke alleging that they have been engaging in a scheme for the past several years to divert bond proceeds for improper, undisclosed uses. The SECs complaint alleges that the purported purpose of prior bond offerings was to fund the development and construction of a Holiday Inn hotel in Harvey. However without informing investors, Harvey officials diverted at least $1.7 million of bond proceeds from these offerings to pay the citys operational costs such as its payroll, and Letke received approximately $269,000 in undisclosed payments derived from bond proceeds, the SEC says. Harvey is now barred from offering or selling any bonds through July 14.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=44B3FD67-B44F-4C58-9410-D6CC5A55656D&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

Apple expected to move quickly to integrate Beats	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Apple Inc. [aapl] is likely to move quickly to integrate Beats into its ecosystem to mitigate the risk of a saturated digital music download market, according to analysts at Credit Suisse. Beats is also a core part of Apples strategy to bolster its presence in the music subscription market. With iTunes stores in 123 countries, 425 retail stores, App stores in 155 countries and an army of 800 [million] users, Apple could very quickly scale a music streaming service, given its existing reach and music deals, said analyst Kulbinder Garcha in a report. He reiterated Apples neutral rating and raised the stocks price target to $96 from $85.71. Shares of Apple were flat at $90.28 on Wednesday.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F867BCB1-57E8-496A-8FA0-0526BC8963F8&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

Economy’s stumble in first quarter historic	By Jeffry Bartash, MarketWatchThe chief reason: Americans spent less than originally assumed, mainly on health care. A bigger drop in U.S. exports, higher imports and a smaller buildup in inventories also contributed to the steeper decline in gross domestic product.The economy previously was estimated to have shrunk 1% in the first three months of the year, a period marked by unusually harsh winter weather that clogged roads, closed workplaces and kept many employees and shoppers home. Cold weather costly in first quarter.How bad was the first quarter? The decline was the biggest during a prolonged expansionary phase in the economy since the end of World War II.The revised GDP report briefly stunned Wall Street and clearly unsettled the White House. President Obama’s chief economic adviser, Jason Furman, cast doubt on the report and argued the economy is much stronger than the first-quarter contraction implied. Read: White House plays down weak GDP.Investors, for their part, shrugged off the backward-looking report. The economy appears to have rebounded in the second quarter and economists polled by MarketWatch predict growth will turn positive again, with a 3.8% increase.The deep drop in GDP from January to March largely stems from lower consumer outlays. The government marked down the increase in consumer spending—the main engine of U.S. economic activity—to a meager 1% in the first quarter from 3.1%.For the most part, the reduced spending reflected lower medical costs. The Bureau of Economic Analysis originally assumed that the introduction of Obamacare would boost health-care spending in the first three months of the year. Yet health-related spending actually fell by $6.4 billion instead of rising by $39.9 billion as previously estimated, according to the revised data .As a result, consumer spending on services rose just 1.5% and not a heady 4.3%. And spending on everyday goods such as groceries or personal-care items fell slightly instead of increasing.The decline in U.S. exports, meanwhile, was even sharper at 8.9% and imports rose 1.8%, which was more than twice as high as previously reported. A bigger trade deficit is a drag on U.S. growth.What’s more, the increase in business inventories was marked down to $45.9 billion from $51.6 billion. The production of goods for later sale is a plus for GDP, but restocking of warehouse shelves took place at less than half the rate in early 2014 compared with the third and fourth quarters of last year.Final sales of U.S. produced goods and services, meanwhile, was reduced to show a 1.3% decline instead of a 0.6% increase.Most other figures in the GDP report were little changed.So what’s the good news? The U.S. appears to have snapped back after the first-quarter contraction, a bevy of economic reports show. Hiring has surged to the highest levels since the recession ended, for example, and people are working longer. Manufacturers are also boosting production and consumer confidence has risen to the highest level in more than six years.Growth is forecast to speed up in the second quarter and linger above 3% in the second half of the year. Most analysts expect some of the economic activity that did not take place because of poor weather earlier in the year to occur in the spring. Some Wall Street firms such as Barclays Capital even boosted their projections for second-quarter growth to as high as 4% based on that premise.Yet the economy has experienced a number of swings since the recession ended in mid-2009 and 2014 is shaping up to be much weaker than analysts expected at the start of the year.More bearish economists such as Stephen Stanley at Pierpont Securities suggest that poor weather in the first-quarter helped to mask underlying weakness in the economy that will re-emerge later on. He predicts the economy is likely to expand closer to 2% to 2.5% through the end of 2014—keeping in line with the nation’s slow-growth trend since the U.S. exited the Great Recession.Also read: Military retreat reduces durable-goods ordersU.S. to allow shipments of crude overseas	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0FC7990C-FC5B-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

The index reached intraday lows after a larger-than-anticipated downward revision in first-quarter gross domestic product contributed to concerns about slowing global growth.European as well as Asian stocks came under pressure Wednesday after a late Tuesday afternoon selloff on Wall Street that left the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.54%  down more than 100 points, its worst performance in more than a month. Profit-taking ahead of the end of the second quarter and an escalation in violence in Iraq were among the factors analysts said spurred the downturn.Reports on Tuesday said at least 50 people were killed after Syrian warplanes hit targets in western Iraq.“There is a feeling that Iraq has the potential to be a drag, and yesterday, perhaps, this was the first real sign of this being the case,” said Hantec Markets analyst Richard Perry in a daily report Wednesday.U.S. stocks on Wednesday moved slightly higher in intraday trade.Soft euro-zone business activity and German confidence data have weighed on European stocks this week. In another round of data from euro-zone countries Wednesday, Italian consumer confidence dipped in June after three months of gains.

Dylan’s ‘Rolling Stone’ lyrics fetch $2 million at auction	By Jon Friedman, MarketWatchDylan’s hastily scrawled words for “ Like a Rolling Stone ,” which was released in 1965, sold at a Sotheby’s auction Tuesday for, yes, a mind-bending two million bucks. Time.com noted that the price tag shattered the previous high-water mark of $1.2 million for John Lennon’s lyrics for the Beatles’ landmark 1967 album, “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.”The recipient of the big prize — whose name was not disclosed — takes home Dylan’s notes, some random doodles of animals in the margins and, mysteriously, a few couplets that were deleted from the final working draft of the hit single, notably: “Dry vermouth/You’ll tell the truth.” The trademark line “how does it feel” is drawn to connect to the name of Al Capone.Dylan scribbled down the words on four pages of stationary in mid-June 1965, shortly after returning a few weeks earlier from England and what would turn out to be the final solo tour of his rich career.The notes reportedly resulted from his stay at the Roger Smith Hotel in Washington, D.C. Another mystery is why Dylan visited Washington at that time. Perhaps he was accompanying his girlfriend and future wife at the time, Sara, who hailed from Delaware, on a trip home. As with so much of Bob Dylan’s legacy, that aspect of the saga may forever remain a mystery.What’s not at all mysterious, though, is how much rock and roll has changed, and gone the way of big business. You can call this another confirmation that baby boomers are ruining the world.Who else but a self-absorbed baby boomer would have the cash and the chutzpah to recapture an element of the golden decade of the ‘60s?To the boomers, this kind of stuff represents a piece of history. But it’s more than that — they want desperately to recapture their halcyon youth, when John Lennon sang “All You Need Is Love” and the world nodded at his cosmic perception.Baby boomers are certainly ruling the world of auction houses and making it clear that they’ll spend any amount of money to feel close to their 1960s rock heroes.For instance, guitar icon Eric Clapton sold at a charity auction more than 70 of his instruments and amplifiers as well as such memorabilia as a Gianni Versace suit that he wore on stage, along with other ephemera such as the Gianni Versace suit that he wore on stage at a 1990 concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Clapton raised more than $2.15 million for the Crossroads Center, a drug-and-alcohol rehab facility in Antigua he co-founded in 1998.Dylan wrote the lyrics across four pages of hotel stationery in mid-June 1965 during a stay at the Roger Smith Hotel, according to Sotheby’s. He later recorded the song when he was 24 years old.This is how the historic event was documented on the Sotheby’s home page:146BOB DYLAN	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=67053A08-FC6F-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

Drone industry’s D.C. lobbyist pushes the human side	By Robert Schroeder, MarketWatch“This technology is an extension of the eyes and the ears of the human being that knows how to do their job better than anyone else,” said Michael Toscano, president and CEO of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, in an interview with MarketWatch. The association counts among its members big-name companies like Boeing Co. /quotes/zigman/220026/delayed/quotes/nls/ba BA +0.70%   and Lockheed Martin Corp. /quotes/zigman/150087/delayed/quotes/nls/lmt LMT +0.58%  as well as smaller firms and universities like Carnegie Mellon.Read: 13 companies pushing the drone revolutionJust don’t call these devices drones, please. The industry prefers unmanned aircraft systems, a term that’s more removed from the devices’ military origins.But whatever you call them, the trade-group chief says the industry is moving faster than regulations can keep up — and is pressing the government to develop rules and open the skies for the technology. The Federal Aviation Administration is now working under a deadline of September 2015 to write rules for drones to share the skies.Drones are coming: Should we invest or take cover?Naturally, the industry isn’t lobbying for heavy regulations. Rather, clarity. Toscano warns that without a road map from regulators, the technology is going to lap the rulemakers. And then it will be even tougher to rein in bad practices.“If we don’t start doing this sooner than later, then you are going to have situations that are undesirable,” said Toscano. “ I will you tell you, right now, today, people are flying this technology because 1. They either don’t know they’re not supposed to for what they’re trying to do, or 2. They don’t care.““In either regard, this is something that has to be addressed sooner than later because if not, it’s going to form itself. And once that happens, it’s going to be twice as hard to try to regulate it after the fact.”Are drones illegal in your state? This map can tell youToscano, who confesses he likes the “Game Boy-ing” aspects of flying a consumer drone, spoke to MarketWatch from the association’s offices in Arlington, VA. by phone recently. The interview has been edited and condensed.MarketWatch : Your office opened in 1972. Fast forward more than 40 years and companies like Amazon /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN +1.39%  .com want to deliver packages by drone. Is the pace of change in the industry as great as it’s ever been, or greater?Toscano : This is a technology that has been born from the military side of the house. Like many other technologies that have come out of the military side, it is now being transitioned to the civil and the commercial side. And like many other technologies that have done that, the military side is great in the creation of it, but the true application of it, the world-changing aspects of it, usually don’t happen until we get to the commercial side. It becomes more affordable, it becomes reliable, and it becomes available to everyone.That’s what you’re starting to see right now, there’s transitioning that has taken place. Unmanned systems, air, ground and maritime, do two things very, very well: they’re very good as a delivery system, and they’re very good at situational awareness. Men and women know how to do their job better than anyone else. What this technology offers up is a way to do it in a more effective and efficient and lifesaving manner.MarketWatch : You’ve said you don’t use the word drone. Why not?Toscano : It’s not that I don’t use the word drone. It’s that most people, when they hear the word drone, have either a negative connotation — they think it’s military, large, hostile, weaponized, autonomous — or they fixate on the thing that is actually just flying. The thing that actually flies is just a truck. It’s only 30% of the system.What’s really important is the mission package payload, the communication link, the ground station, and mostly important, the human being. There is a human being or a person that is involved either in the loop, on the loop, with the system. When most people hear the word drone, I think it just has the wrong connotation.MarketWatch : As a lobbyist, an association president, where do you find you need to do the most explaining here in Washington? There must still be concerns about privacy, or safety in the case of commercial drones.Toscano : With any revolutionary-type technology — some people call it disruptive — there is always going to be this tremendous capability, but there is technology that can be misused either intentionally or unintentionally as well. There isn’t any technology that we’ve ever had that doesn’t have that potential.I assume you have a computer. That computer allows you to do a lot of great and wonderful things. But it can also be used for bullying, it can be used for identity theft, it can be used for pornography. There’s a lot of things that can go wrong with this technology. We have this thing called the automobile; we’ve had it around for 110 years, since Henry Ford came out with the assembly line. And we kill 33,000 people every year. We have 6.3 million accidents. It’s the leading cause of death [for] people between the age of 4 and 34 in this country. But yet we still drive cars every day.Illustrations by Terrence HoranField guide to drones: A buyer’s guide (interactive)	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E46462B4-F87B-11E3-BFDE-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25
Big Housing doles out the cash to Cochran and others	By Ruth Mantell, MarketWatchHousing groups have already spent millions of dollars this election season, and check-writing is sure to ramp up over coming months. Given the partisan gridlock in Congress, one might wonder why the industry would bother to invest so much in lawmakers who may accomplish very little. The answer is simple: advocates must use every opportunity to promote their position.“A trade group representing an industry cannot be caught on the sidelines and unprepared,” said Brian Gardner, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a New York-based investment bank. “Groups and advocates want to be proactive and always try to build political capital, even when the prospects of legislation are low.”The major looming political issue for the housing industry is mortgage-finance reform, including what to do with federally controlled giants Fannie Mae /quotes/zigman/226360/delayed/quotes/nls/fnma FNMA +0.25%  and Freddie Mac /quotes/zigman/226335/delayed/quotes/nls/fmcc FMCC +0.77% , which back about six-in-10 new mortgages. Much of the housing industry wants Congress to retain some place for the government in the mortgage marketplace, while encouraging greater private investment. Other priorities for the housing industry are whether tax reform will hit the mortgage-interest deduction, terrorism-risk insurance, flood insurance, immigration, and other issues.The housing market as a whole is at the point where the worst of the crisis has passed. Foreclosures are dropping, home equity is rising and job growth, a key factor behind home sales, is firming.“Fewer people are at risk of losing their homes,” said Jed Kolko, chief economist at real estate site Trulia.Still, years after the bubble burst, Washington remains waist deep in unresolved issues affecting the housing market, and industry advocates are paying close attention to action on Capitol Hill.“Our members are just as interested as any of the other stakeholders in the housing market’s recovery, concerned about creating a favorable business environment for them to offer sustainable mortgage credit to consumers,” said Bill Killmer, chief lobbyist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. “We need to be involved with folks that have the capacity to influence the debate.”The market’s rebound may be cutting the urgency among lawmakers to move faster on, for example, ending the federal conservatorship of government sponsored enterprises Fannie and Freddie – a relationship originally intended to be temporary, but that is now approaching its six-year birthday. A bill that would wind down Fannie and Freddie and create a federal emergency backstop for mortgage-backed securities is stalled in the Senate, having passed in a committee with too little support to force a floor vote anytime soon. A Republican proposal in the House would create no such government guarantee.The National Association of Realtors has already contributed more than $1.4 million to federal candidates, about 48% to Democrats and 52% to Republicans, according to OpenSecrets.org, a site that follows money in politics.“Housing and real estate issues are pretty much in the middle of the political spectrum. Our friends are in both parties,” said Jamie Gregory, NAR’s deputy chief lobbyist.Its sizable political contributions make NAR a “heavy hitter,” according to OpenSecrets.“We are in the business of electing people to Congress that support housing and real estate,” Gregory said. ”It’s people that stand up and are advocates. We get involved with those kinds of activities where we can make a difference and we do it where our friends need the help. We don’t just do it to sort of wave a flag.”NAR also focuses on developing relationships over time, rather than just looking at single issues. Sen. Thad Cochran, a Republican of Mississippi who won Tuesday’s runoff , is a large beneficiary of NAR’s “outside” spending — expenditures made independently of a candidate’s committees — with the Realtor group investing more than $780,000 in support of his candidacy. Cochran, a senior member in his chamber, is also on the Senate Appropriations Committee, a powerful panel that oversees spending.Cochran has also been a strong advocate for NAR issues over the years, such as flood insurance and rural housing.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=69AD392C-FB0C-11E3-AE23-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

Supreme Court ruling called a death knell for Aereo	By Keach HageyWednesday’s Supreme Court ruling against Aereo will most likely mean the end of the insurgent television-streaming company that CEO Chet Kanojia started in 2012--and Diller backed--and the preservation of the existing television ecosystem, analysts and media lawyers say.The justices’ determination that Aereo violates the copyrights of broadcast networks’ programming “means Aereo shuts down, and Aereo-like services don’t pop up,” said John Hane, a lawyer specializing in media issues at the Pillsbury law firm in Washington, D.C. “That’s good for everybody whose business is in creating and distributing content legitimately.”Kanojia has been less definitive, noting in interviews that Aereo has a lot of valuable technology. Some analysts expect Aereo to sell off its expertise in capturing video signals, transferring them to digital streams and storing them in the “cloud” to the existing television industry, which has been trying to roll-out online streaming of its content to mobile devices on its own terms.Gus Hurwitz, an assistant professor of law at the University of Nebraska College of Law, said Aereo does have the option “to work with the broadcast industry, instead of trying to disrupt it.”“Aereo would bring a known and trusted brand and working distribution platform to the market and could, conceivably, license content from local broadcasters,” Hurwitz said.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatchIf you haven’t cut the cord on cable TV, you shouldCBS leads U.S. broadcast stocks higher are ruling against AereoGoogle to reveal its TV set-top box in race with Apple, Amazon	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=D44CD154-FC77-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25
Supreme Court: Police need warrants to search cellphone data	By Jess BravinThe court, in a unanimous ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts, said both the quantity and quality of information contained in modern handhelds is constitutionally protected.Chief Justice Roberts rejected law-enforcement arguments that cellphones fell under a long-standing exception to the warrant requirement that allows police to search the contents of suspects’ pockets to make sure they don’t carry weapons or destroy evidence.“Modern cellphones are not a technological convenience,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “With all they contain and all they may reveal, they hold for many Americans ‘the privacies of life,’“ he wrote.An expanded version of this story appears at WSJ.com.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=80613BCE-FC78-11E3-B93C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

A bold plan for Pope Francis, Bill Gates to save the world	By Paul B. Farrell, MarketWatchFortunately Gates has a track record here: Back in 2009 he called billionaires Buffett, Rockefeller, Soros, Bloomberg, Turner, Oprah and other philanthropists to a secret meeting in the Manhattan home of Sir Paul Nurse, British Nobel biochemist and president of Rockefeller University. Again, in 2010 Gates created the “Giving Pledge” which now has 122 of the world’s Super Rich committing to give away half their fortunes in their lifetime.And there are even more wealthy folks to work with. The world is mass-producing billionaires: Today there are 1,645 billionaires compared with 322 in 2000, with $7 trillion. Forbes says the U.S. has 492, Europe 468, China 358, Russia 111, Latin America 85, India 65, Canada 29, Africa 29, and more.And at a time when cooperation is virtually impossible, Bill Gates’ experience offers a solution: Helping build a dream team from those 67 billionaire philanthropists, co-hosting with Pope Francis. Not so far-fetched either. Yes, Pope Francis has big issues with capitalism, but there’s still wisdom and virtue in Sun Tzu’s ancient advice to generals, keep friends close, your enemies closer. And the world certainly needs innovative solutions, fast.Besides, the trend promises to continue. The Super Rich will get richer: Credit Suisse Bank even predicts 11 trillionaire families by 2100. They are also superoptimistic, see the UN’s population estimates of another three billion by 2050 as new opportunities with more consumers. And if excess consumption and overpopulation become problems, the Super Rich have faith new technologies will create alternative resources, greater efficiencies that will save the planet.Yes, Pope Francis sees a different trend. But that’s all the more reason the pope should work with Gates and every billionaire ready to solve the impossible problems challenging our world.Bill and Melinda Gates are already committed, spending a fortune, changing the world. Pope Francis has the power base, the leadership skills, the authority to make things happen. Together they can rise above today’s battlefield of partisan politicians, competing anarchies, sovereign nations, dictators, myopic capitalists. Our polarized America is a perfect example of dysfunctional leadership. In the future, global teamwork will be essential for new solutions, timely action.By 2050 at current growth rates, three critical trends will have predictably imploded in a combustible critical mass, driving us over the edge of a proverbial cliff, past the known survival limits of human civilization and a sustainable planet. This be the first time in history, says noted anthropologist Jared Diamond, where climate change is an interlocking set of “time bombs with fuses of less than 50 years,” that “if unsolved would do us great harm, because they all interact with each other ... we need to solve them all,” turn off the ticking time-bomb.Pope Francis has already warned us of the three self-destructive trends: First: unsustainable global warming and climate change on Planet-Earth. Second: The pope says the global economy is “near collapse” as inequality increases, fueling revolutions. Third: Earth’s natural resources will be unable to feed the 10 billion people living in 2050. The three go hand-in-hand, merge, with trigger mechanisms cross-linked to ignite simultaneously.True, Pope Francis, Bill Gates and many other billionaires are already working on philanthropic projects of personal interest. Now it’s time to combine forces, see the world as one entity, search for common solutions. For as Ben Franklin put it during the signing of the Declaration of Independence back in 1776: “We must, indeed, all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.”Here is a review of this accelerating triple-threat now on track to destroy civilization:First, after the conclusion of the recent Pontifical Academies of Sciences joint workshop on “Sustainable Humanity, Sustainable Nature: Our Responsibility,” Pope Francis added the “Biblical Case for Addressing Climate Change,” issuing an unequivocal warning to a large crowd assembled in Rome. The pope called on all of us to “Safeguard Creation ... Because if we destroy Creation, Creation will destroy us! Never forget this.”	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=EF38C0A4-FB0F-11E3-8AA5-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

8 things you need to know about Social Security	“Actually, our payroll system is impossibly complicated. You can pick from dozens of different ways to be paid and hundreds of different start dates, and each will produce a different salary. We offer some guidance, but we’re short-handed. As such, deciding when and how to collect a paycheck is essentially up to you.“So…what would you like to do?”Welcome to Social Security.Each day, thousands of Americans apply for the first time for Social Security benefits. And each day—if questions from our readers and the stories we hear from financial advisers are any indication—many applicants have no idea what they’re getting into. They know little or nothing about the program’s complexity, the myriad ways to collect benefits and the Social Security Administration’s staffing and service problems.As such, they’re putting their retirement—and, in many cases, their spouses’ future—at risk.“People spend more time planning a vacation than they do planning for 20 or 30 years of Social Security benefits,” says Barry Kaplan, chief investment officer for Cambridge Wealth Counsel in Atlanta. Those benefits, he notes, are insurance against market downturns, hyperinflation and living longer than you anticipate. But would-be beneficiaries, he says, typically “go into this without a clue.”If you and/or your spouse are weighing your options about Social Security, here’s a look at some of the biggest issues—involving both the agency and the benefits program—that could shape your retirement for better or worse.The Social Security Administration isn’t your financial adviserA fair amount of the mail we receive from readers with questions or complaints about Social Security goes something like this: “My Social Security office never told me about….” About a particular strategy for claiming benefits. About a little-known rule. About the consequences of starting one’s payouts at a particular point in time.No, the Social Security Administration isn’t perfect. (More about this in a moment.)But its primary job is delivering a service, paying 59 million beneficiaries, and not financial planning. The agency provides loads of information about benefits on its website and does its best to answer the public’s questions in its field offices and by telephone. But a comprehensive talk about the nuances of Social Security and your financial future? That’s not going to happen.Indeed, the Social Security Administration doesn’t know about—and it isn’t the agency’s job to know about—your household budget, your health, your savings, life insurance, plans you might have to work in retirement. In short, all the variables that should go into a decision about filing for benefits, says Kaplan in Atlanta.So, the onus is on you to learn about, or find help in deciphering, the basics: how benefits work, claiming strategies, possible pitfalls. And if you’re hellbent, for instance, on grabbing a payout at age 62 (the earliest possible date for most people) and locking yourself—and perhaps your spouse—into a permanent reduction in benefits, the agency isn’t going to stop you.The Social Security Administration is stretched increasingly thin at the worst possible timeIn March, Carolyn Colvin, the agency’s acting commissioner, didn’t mince words in a report tied to President Obama’s request for additional funding for the Social Security Administration.“Our service and stewardship efforts [have] deteriorated,” she said. “In fiscal year 2013, the public had to wait longer for a decision on their disability claim, to talk to a representative on our national 800 number, and to schedule an appointment in our field offices.”(See also: Social Security office closures irk retirees, senators. )The agency, in short, is overextended. In the past three years, it has lost 11,000 employees, or about 12% of its workforce; by 2022, about 60% of its supervisors will be eligible to retire. Meanwhile, budget cuts have resulted in the consolidation of 44 field offices, the closing of 503 contact stations (mobile service facilities) and a delay in plans to open eight hearing offices (where appeals about agency decisions involving retirement and disability benefits are heard) and one call center.And that 800 number? According to a report in December from the agency’s inspector general, wait times in 2013 exceeded 10 minutes, an increase of more than five minutes from 2012.The point: The Social Security Administration is grappling with its own problems just as the baby-boom generation, with about 75 million members, is moving full speed into retirement. (The oldest boomers are turning 68 this year.) The demands on the agency mean that you might not be able to find, or find in a timely fashion, the information or help you need. That said…More services outside Social Security are offering more helpThe Social Security Administration is the first to acknowledge that benefits are complicated. The opening paragraphs of the agency’s “Social Security Handbook,” a guide to the benefits program, state plainly: “The Social Security programs are so complex it is impossible to include information [in the handbook] about every topic.”Fortunately, a growing number of tools and services—some free, others for a cost—are available to help people navigate these waters.In recent years, AARP, the Washington-based advocacy group for older Americans, and T. Rowe Price Group Inc., the Baltimore-based mutual-fund company, have introduced sophisticated online calculators that help users determine how and when to claim benefits. Both are free. ( The Social Security Administration has several calculators, also free, that can help determine the size of your benefits, but not necessarily when to claim them for maximum effect.)Among the services that charge a fee: MaximizeMySocialSecurity.com , from Economic Security Planning Inc.; SocialSecurityChoices.com , from SocSec Analytics LLC; and SocialSecuritySolutions.com, all started by academics. Our review of several Social Security tools last fall singled out Social Security Solutions for its ease of use and Maximize My Social Security for its flexibility.Finally, check out weekly columns at the Public Broadcasting Service website from Laurence Kotlikoff , an economics professor at Boston University and the developer of Maximize My Social Security. The articles, published each Monday, address a wide range of issues about Social Security (including numerous “secrets” and “gotchas”) and answer questions about benefits. In short, invaluable reading.The earnings test deters people from working in retirement—and shouldn’tSocial Security’s earnings test, in which benefits are reduced if a person is collecting benefits and income at the same time, generates numerous questions and much confusion. But the apparent penalties aren’t what they seem.If you are under your full retirement age when you first receive Social Security benefits and if you have earned income, $1 in benefits will be deducted for each $2 you earn above an annual limit. In 2014, that limit is $15,480. In the year you reach your full retirement age, the penalty shrinks; after you reach full retirement age, the deductions end completely.The good news: Money lost to the earnings test isn’t really lost. Once you reach full retirement age, Social Security recalculates—and increases—your future benefits to account for any dollars withheld.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7B301388-FB0A-11E3-AE23-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

Clinton’s money gaffes becoming a campaign hurdle	By Darrell Delamaide, MarketWatchHillary Clinton’s initial gaffe about the former first family’s fortune may have seemed like a speed bump on her road to the White House, but her repeated awkwardness on the subject is turning their wealth into a major hurdle.After telling ABC’s Diane Sawyer earlier this month that she and Bill Clinton were “dead broke” when they left the White House, the former first lady responded this week to a question from the Guardian about their fortune — estimated at tens of millions of dollars — by saying that they are not “truly well off.”This patently ludicrous statement has been met with well-deserved derision.But the full statement raises other issues. The question from Guardian reporter Ed Pilkington was whether their huge personal wealth would lead people to see them as part of the problem rather than part of the solution.“But they don’t see me as part of the problem,” Hillary Clinton replied, “because we pay ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off, not to name names; and we’ve done it through dint of hard work.”For good measure, Pilkington adds that the statement was followed by a burst of laughter that he has learned to interpret as a sign of discomfort.The part of the statement most offensive to working-class Americans, however, may be “through dint of hard work.”She no doubt means the crushing speaking schedule that former President Bill Clinton must keep in order to amass more than $100 million in fees, even at $200,000-plus a pop.The fact that this no doubt entails first-class air travel, five-star hotels, and the partying that inevitably accompanies the former president may not strike Americans juggling two or three minimum-wage jobs as “hard work.”Especially considering that those elevated fees trade partly on Clinton’s celebrity status as former president and partly as an investment in a future President Clinton — Hillary.Chelsea Clinton has only exacerbated the situation after it emerged that NBC was paying the 34-year-old $600,000 a year for what was essentially a part-time job that produced little in tangible results.This did not stop the younger Clinton, whose wedding reportedly cost $3 million and whose Manhattan apartment cost $10 million, saying in an interview published this week by another British daily, the Telegraph , that money is not that important to her.“I was curious if I could care about [money] on some fundamental level, and I couldn’t,” the newspaper quoted Chelsea Clinton as saying in explaining how she resisted following her parents’ example. “That wasn’t the metric of success I wanted in my life.”	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=41721C52-FBCF-11E3-8AA5-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25
Feds Tarullo: Banks need to improve capital planning process	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Some U.S. banks still seem to be in the dark about the riskiness of their businesses, said Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo on Wednesday. Some firms still lack reliable information about their businesses and exposures, Tarullo said during a speech in Boston at a conference on the Feds stress test. These deficiencies are, in some instances, compounded by weak oversight by senior management and boards of directors, and lack of effective checks and accountability in the process, he said. Tarullo said the stress test is not a PGA tournament - there is no foreordained cut that some participants will miss. He said the Fed will work with the banks throughout the year on problems and only in unusual circumstances should banks be surprised by the outcome. Citigroup [s:c] officials said they were shocked in March when they learned that they had failed the more subjective or qualitative part of the latest stress test. Tarullo said that the Fed found that many firms had a long way to go to meet high standards of capital planning backed by strong risk management when the stress tests were first conducted in 2009. Given that gap, the Fed has allowed time for banks to work toward that goal. We do, however, expect firms to continue to make steady progress each year, he said.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C6F0A2E4-0C44-4BFF-A63A-2CA549118279&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25
Treasurys rise after GDP revision, durable goods	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Treasurys rose Wednesday, pushing yields lower, after a round of weak U.S. economic data. The U.S. economy contracted 2.9% in the first quarter instead of shrinking at 1% annual pace as previously reported. Orders for U.S. durable goods, or big-ticket items, fell by more than expected in May. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR 0.00% yield fell 3 basis points to 2.541%. One basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Chinese to liberalize renminbi but will do it their way	By David Marsh, MarketWatchThe way of out of this dilemma has now become clearer. China’s planned liberalization will be heavily constrained by rules and regulations.Well aware of the downside of losing the capability to steer their own currency, leading Chinese officials say that the traditional “administered” approach to running the renminbi will be replaced by “macroprudential management.” In other words, Beijing will remain firmly in control.Under what the Beijing authorities call “the new concept of convertibility,” China will engineer a much wider use of the renminbi across the global landscape, while continuing to exercise overall stewardship.The benefit for the Chinese authorities is that “liberalization, Beijing-style” is completely aligned with new thinking at the International Monetary Fund, announced in November 2012, which explicitly approved “capital flow management measures” as part of a fresh approach to international monetary coordination.The reward that beckons for Beijing is substantial: to rival the status of the dollar and, one day perhaps, to displace it as the No. 1 international currency. Such a prize would allow China to carry out a great variety of transactions in goods, services and capital on more advantageous conditions than at present, adding a sizable dose of economic clout to its sought-after status as a political superpower.The ultimate goal is to capture part of America’s so-called “exorbitant privilege” stemming from the dollar’s position as the world’s prime reserve asset. This in turn gives the U.S. Treasury, over the longer term, the comfortable ability of being able to fund its deficits via foreign inflows, at much lower rates of interest than most other countries.Already in the past three years, China has made considerable progress in renminbi internationalization, in terms of increasing the use of the currency for trade flows and in capital raising. Centers like London, Frankfurt and Luxembourg, as well as Hong Kong and Singapore, have now emerged as offshore hubs for renminbi transactions.Much more is on the way. Beijing will open its onshore capital markets for fund-raising by international companies (as opposed to using Hong Kong, where much international renminbi borrowing has been concentrated so far). More international asset managers are being given quotas for onshore investment in China, while Chinese asset management companies are building plans for expanding their operations abroad.In contrast to the fraught state of Britain’s overall political relations with the rest of the European Union, London and Frankfurt have developed an informal understanding that the two cities will share the main responsibilities in Europe for boosting cross-border use of the renminbi. Underlining the concert approach were the announcements that China Construction Bank will be the official clearing bank for renminbi trading in London and Bank of China will have that role in Frankfurt.The problem for China is that financial openness, and above all proceeding to full convertibility of the renminbi by completing the liberalization of capital-account transactions, would make the Beijing authorities vulnerable to the possibility of sizable amounts of funds leaving the country.Further, it would expose China far more than at present to the vagaries of U.S. monetary policy and to waves of foreign speculation of the sort that brought down Asian currencies in the continent’s financial crisis of 1997-98. China’s leaders do not forget that one reason for the demise of the Nationalist regime of Chiang Kai-shek, and the eventual birth of the Communist People’s Republic in 1949, was that in the 1940s China lost control of the currency — a mistake that Beijing’s present leaders are determined not to repeat.Fortunately — and not without considerable persuasive efforts from China and other emerging market economies — the IMF has moved in a direction backing a middle line on capital-account opening. According to the IMF’s new policy on capital flows, announced in November 2012, “countries with extensive and long-standing measures to limit capital flows are likely to benefit from further liberalization in an orderly manner. There is, however, no presumption that full liberalization is an appropriate goal for all countries at all times. “The absence of full capital-account liberalization does not deter an estimated 30 to 40 central banks from around the world from holding significant quantities of renminbi in their foreign reserves. Chinese banks in London and other overseas centers are formulating plans for new renminbi-denominated instruments — including swaps and options, commercial paper, various arrangements for bond trading and collateral, and different forms of investment products.All this can take place in an overall environment where the Beijing authorities retain, as far as possible, overall control. Internationalization of the renminbi is one of the greatest experiments in economic history — and China is determined to ensure that as little as possible goes wrong.Also read these stories:Central banks becoming major investors in stock marketsHong Kong and Beijing on collision course	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0ED66024-FB01-11E3-9C64-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

GoPro, Ambarella get lift from Google acquisition	By Michael ComeauThe theme is obvious: Google is upping its bet on the “Internet of things,” aka attaching the Internet to basically everything. (I just joined it myself with a Fitbit scale.)Dropcam fits in here because it doesn’t just make cameras; it also has a cloud-storage service to archive video footage, which reduces the risk of commoditization and increases customer stickiness.In its blog post, Nest insists that privacy (always a question with Google) won’t be an issue. Data will not be shared with anyone (including Google) without the user’s permission, and ads are not part of Nest and Dropcam’s business strategy.In terms of ancillary plays, GoPro /quotes/zigman/1672656/delayed MY:GPRO -9.09%  and Ambarella /quotes/zigman/12221594/delayed/quotes/nls/amba AMBA -1.00%  may benefit from this deal.GoPro isn’t yet public, but it makes action and sports cameras with a heavy Internet and social media bent.

U.S. economy contracted 2.9% in first quarter	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The U.S. economy shrank by a 2.9% annual pace in the first quarter instead of 1% as previously reported, marking the biggest decline since early 2009 when the Great Recession was winding down. The rise in consumer spending, the main source of U.S. economic activity, was slashed to 1% from 3%, largely because Americans reduced spending on health care and other services. The government originally assumed that the introduction of Obamacare would boost health-care spending in the first three months of the year. Yet health-related spending actually fell by $6.4 billion instead of rising by $39.9 billion as previously estimated, according to newly revised figures. Net exports also declined more than expected to further trim first-quarter GDP. Also, the increase in inventories was marked down to $45.9 billion from $51.6 billion. Final sales of U.S. produced goods and services, meanwhile, was revised down to show a 1.3% decline instead of a 0.6% increase. Most other figures in the GDP report were little changed.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8545C4AE-A237-48F0-825B-D83453FE62A2&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25
Durable orders fall 1% in May on fewer military bookings	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Orders for durable U.S. goods fell 1% in May, mainly because of a sharp drop in Pentagon demand for military hardware. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected durable-goods orders to fall 0.5%. Yet stripping out defense, orders rose 0.6% amid gains in most main categories except for airlines and computers, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Bookings excluding the volatile transportation sector were down 0.1%, with a 5.9% dropoff in airline orders offsetting a 2.1% gain in autos. Orders for core capital goods - a measure of business investment - climbed 0.7% in May after falling 1.1% in April. Shipments of core capital goods, a category used to calculate quarterly economic growth, rose 0.4% in May. Durable-goods orders for April were revised up to show a 0.8% increase instead of 0.6%.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=55B8EAAA-5E48-4EE8-9E47-CC3A61DCCBC5&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

The company said its raising its full-year earnings per share and free cash flow guidance to the the upper end of previous ranges, given the strong outlook for its seeds and traits business. Coupled with an expanding portfolio of solutions for farmers, this provides confidence to target at least doubling our ongoing earnings per share over the next five years and evolve our capital allocation priorities, Chief Executive Hugh Grant said in a statement. The companys board has approved an additional $10 billion share buyback program, he said.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=4E3B2672-C7C6-42F7-978D-16CE12873FE2&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25
FIFA begins action against Luis Suarez over bite	LONDON (MarketWatch) -- FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against Luis Suarez after the Uruguayan soccer player appeared to bite an opponent during a World Cup game on Tuesday. Italys Giorgio Chiellini claims the striker bit him on the shoulder during the game, which saw Uruguay win 1-0 and go through to the next stage of the soccer tournament. While the referee took no action at the time, FIFA noted in a statement it is responsible for sanctioning serious incidents which have escaped match officials attention. Suarez faces a ban of up to 24 matches or two years if found guilty, and has until 5 p.m. Wednesday in Brazil to make his case to FIFA. The striker has seen bans in the U.K. and the Netherlands over previous biting incidents.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8569C3ED-991D-4C5E-8047-8D1FC65B7FCB&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

Whistleblower to get millions for speaking up	By Al LewisShe led a double life as a pharmaceutical sales rep and as an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Nearly a decade’s worth of her efforts led to her former employer, Endo Health Solutions Inc. /quotes/zigman/30017080/delayed/quotes/nls/endp ENDP -0.32%  entering into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice earlier this year.Ryan accused Endo of illegally marketing its Lidoderm “pain patch” and filing false Medicare claims. The government joined the whistleblower’s lawsuit she filed in 2005. And Endo agreed to a $193 million settlement, saving U.S. taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. Read Al Lewis’s previous column: Slap on the wrist for pushing pain killersRyan, 44 years old, will likely receive a significant slice — perhaps as much as 15% or 25% of the $172 million civil recovery portion of the settlement.On Monday, a federal judge ruled that Ryan is the sole whistleblower entitled to receive this award. (There were a couple of others who had piled in as well once Ryan got the case rolling.) The James Hoyer Law Firm of Tampa, Fla., which represented Ryan, will get a significant cut of her take.But the episode is on track to end with a lot of money in Ryan’s bank account.“Do not file a case because you think you’re going to be a multimillionaire afterward,” Ryan said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “You have to follow your heart of hearts.”Ryan said she filed her case because she was a witness to the crime of a large corporation defrauding the government. It was a moral conviction she could not override for a sales commission.Over the past five years, the government has recovered more than $19 billion lost to health-care frauds, thanks in part to people like Ryan filing whistleblower lawsuits.Ryan never doubted she had the facts on her side. But she was never assured the government would join her case, that there would be a settlement, or that she’d be ruled eligible to collect a portion of the settlement. Meantime, she was risking her career.Ryan grew up in Cincinnati and earned a degree in mortuary science from Xavier University. Following school, she took a different path and went to work in sales. She worked at Johnson & Johnson /quotes/zigman/230812/delayed/quotes/nls/jnj JNJ -0.42%  and Pharmacia (now part of Pfizer /quotes/zigman/238207/delayed/quotes/nls/pfe PFE +0.53%  ) before joining Endo in 2002.In 2005, she attended a sales meeting where a district manager brazenly spoke of a “loophole” that salespeople could exploit in mass marketing the Lidoderm patch.The Food and Drug Administration had approved the patch for only one relatively rare complication related to the shingles virus. But the district manager encouraged the sales force to sell it for all kinds of “off-label” uses. The company even adopted the marketing slogan: “Put the patch where the pain is.”	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8D64E372-FBE5-11E3-8AA5-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25
U.S. set to allow first shipments of unrefined oil overseas	By Christian Berthelsen and Lynn CookFederal officials have told two energy companies that they can legally export a kind of ultra-light oil that has become plentiful as drillers tap shale formations across the U.S. With relatively minimal processing, oil shipments could begin as early as August, according to one industry executive involved in the matter.Using a process known as a private ruling, the U.S. Commerce Dept.’s Bureau of Industry and Security is allowing Pioneer Natural Resources Co. /quotes/zigman/185808/delayed/quotes/nls/pxd PXD +0.19%   of Irving, Texas, and Enterprise Products Partners LP /quotes/zigman/229258/delayed/quotes/nls/epd EPD -1.10%   of Houston to export ultra-light oil known as condensate to foreign buyers who could turn it into gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.Both companies confirmed they had received the rulings.Under current rules, companies can export refined fuel, such as gasoline and diesel, but not oil itself. The Administration’s new approach, which hasn’t been publicly announced, redefines some ultra-light oil as fuel after it has been minimally processed, making it eligible for sale abroad.Read the full article at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Is this the beginning of the end of the bull market?10 laggard stocks that could get a huge M&A premiumRobo-advisors, Syrian strikes and the stock-market shift they signal	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=4A5F6D90-FBEA-11E3-AE23-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

Asia Stocks recap: One for the bears	Welcome to the Asia Stocks live blog, a running account of what the region’s share markets are doing, along with other news. Today, local equities struggle in the shadow of weak session on Wall Street.Unsurprisingly, Japanese stocks are knocking lower this morning after an overnight pullback on the U.S. markets, though Tokyo is already off its opening lows, with the Nikkei Average down 0.3% after starting with a 0.5% loss. The Topix is down 0.2%.While Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe formally unveiled his slate of economic reform measures after yesterday’s market close, many of the details had been reported early last week. As a result, news of a planned corporate-tax cut and other measures seem be having little effect on the market, with the negative Wall Street lead more of a factor.Techs and industrials are helping lead the retreat, with TDK down 1.5%, Renesas down 1%, Nintendo and Hitachi Construction Machinery down 1.3% each, and Tokyo Electron down 1.1%.Shares of Pioneer are 3.5% lower, as the once-fabled maker of stereo systems is selling off its audiovisual-equipment for an undisclosed amount, seeking to focus on car navigation and auto stereos instead.Kyocera is 1.7% weaker, failing to get a boost from comments by its president, carried in the Nikkei business daily, that it will seek to grow its pretax profit by 40% by fiscal 2017.On the upside for techs, the recent parade of news about Apple’s plans to begin production on its iPhone 6 seems to be helping Apple suppliers a little: Sharp is up 0.9%, Japan Display is up 0.2%, and Murata Manufacturing is up 0.1%.Advantest is rising 0.8% after announcing a new digital module it says will improve efficiency in testing system-on-chip devices.Meanwhile, energy shares are recovering a bit from losses yesterday as oil futures stage a modest rebound. Japan Petroleum Exploration (Japex) is up 1.3%, Inpex is up 0.5% and JX Holdings is up 0.4%.It’s another weak one in Australia, with the ASX 200 down 1% as miners stage their latest retreat.Though gold prices rose and copper held steady, a quarterly outlook report from the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics may be weighing on sentiment. Although the bureau’s report said Australian resource exports are expected to rise 2.6% this fiscal year, the gains will be more about higher production than any improvement in prices.“Looking forward, price pressures will continue to impact of domestic producers in 2014-15 with falling commodity prices and a persistently strong [Australian] dollar impacting on export values. This will draw a sharp focus towards managing costs and enhancing productivity in the sector,” the bureau said.And so, we find mining shares significantly lower: BHP Billiton and Alumina down 1.1% each, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals down 1.4% each, , Atlas Iron down 2.1%, Newcrest Mining down 1.6%, and Evolution Mining is down 5.4% after issuing new ore-reserve estimates.On the upside, Treasury Wine Estates is up 0.7%, as investors shrug off the vintner’s announcement of a $243 million writedown on its brands and other assets, though the company is also sticking to its current profit outlook.And then there’s Westfield. Today is the first day of trading to reflect the mall operator’s spin-off of its Australian and New Zealand assets, which are now listed as Scentre Group.The market verdict? It prefers Westfield’s international business: The new, international-only Westfield shares are up 1.3%, while Scentre is down 2.5% on its debut.Tokyo (Nikkei Average) down 0.6%Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) down 0.9%Seoul (Kospi) down 0.3%Hong Kong markets lack strength this morning after a mild rebound yesterday, with the Hang Seng Index trading flat following brief opening gains.Mainland Chinese banks and real-estate shares are among the decliners. ICBC is down 0.2%, China Construction Bank is down 0.4%, and China Merchants Bank is down 0.3%, while among the mainland-exposed property names, China Overseas Land is down 1.9%, Agile is down 0.8%, and New Word Development is down 0.3%.On the other hand, China South City Holdings is rallying 5.9%, after the developer and trade-center operator said it has signed a memorandum with Internet giant Tencent Holdings (currently up 0.4%) for cooperation in e-commerce and the creation of an O2O (online to offline) business platform.Also aiding the stock is a reported 27% jump in South China City’s net profit for fiscal 2013 ending in March.Meanwhile, China Vanke — the nation’s largest residential developer by sales, with a primary listing on the Shenzhen market — is down a sharp 4.8% as it debuts on Hong Kong’s main board. Vanke was listed by way of “introduction,” which means it only transferred its Hong Kong dollar-denominated Class B shares to the Hong Kong bourse without raising any additional funds or issuing new shares.Over on the Chinese mainland, the Shanghai Composite Index is down 0.7% after rising 0.5% yesterday.Tokyo (Nikkei Average) down 0.5%Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) up 0.1%Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) down 0.6%Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) down 0.5%Seoul (Kospi) down 0.5%Taipei (Taiex) down 0.1%Talk is swirling around Apple’s iPhone 6, with reports saying the new smartphone will start production in East Asia next month and then ship in September.On Monday, Bloomberg reported the new iPhones, which will be bigger than past iterations, will begin production in July. This, after Raymond James said late last week that the new phone will likely price $100 above iPhones of the current size.And this morning, the Nikkei cited Chinese media accounts that the new phone’s lead assembler Foxconn will hire some 100,000 new workers to make the device.And it’s not just about the iPhone 6. Reuters reported last week that July would also mark the start of production for an Apple smartwatch, with Taiwan’s Quanta Computer helping build the gadget.What does this all mean for the market?Shares of Foxconn, listed in Hong Kong as FIH Mobile, are down 4.4% at the midday break, even after the company released a profit-outlook update promising January-June earnings “moderately higher” than the year-earlier period.Likewise, Foxconn’s corporate parent, Hon Hai Precision, is trading 1.1% lower in Taipei. And fellow Taiwanese tech Pegatron, named in other reports as another link in the supply chain for the new iPhone, is down 0.5%.Also in Taipei, alleged smartwatch maker Quanta is down 1.3% — this, even though the Taiex is slipping by just 0.1%. Then again, Quanta is up 4.5% for the month to date, while Hon Hai is up 5.1% for the same period.Meanwhile, shares of Apple itself shot higher in early U.S. trade Tuesday on the back of the Bloomberg report about the new iPhone’s size, though the stock got caught in a broader market pullback to end the day with a mere 0.1% gain.Tokyo (Nikkei Average) down 0.6%Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) up 0.1% (at break)Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) down 0.5% (at break)Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) down 0.8%Seoul (Kospi) down 0.5%Mumbai (Sensex) flatTaipei (Taiex) down 0.1%Here are some more news items making headlines in Asia today:Company making meat printer gets Asian cashNational Australia Bank: Mortgage outlook strong China’s YouTube jihadis: Videos spread militant message (video) Why Abenomics 2.0 may not boost Japan’s economy (video)Tokyo (Nikkei Average) down 0.7% (closed)Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) down 0.6% (closed)Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) flatShanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) down 0.4%Seoul (Kospi) down 0.6%Mumbai (Sensex) down 0.1%Taipei (Taiex) flatTokyo (Nikkei Average) down 0.7% at 15,266.61 (closed) Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) down 0.1% at 22,866.70 (closed) Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) down 0.4% at 2,025.50 (closed) Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) down 0.6% at 5,402.00 (closed) Seoul (Kospi) down 0.6% at 1,981.77  (closed) Taipei (Taiex) down 4 points at 9,242.16 (closed)The Tell is MarketWatch’s fast and engaging look at trends and themes in the day’s markets.

‘Obli-cation’ trips are making you broke	By Catey Hill, MarketWatchAccording to a survey released Wednesday by travel-booking site Hotwire.com , every year Americans spend $185 billion — nearly $800 per person — just on “leisure” trips they feel obligated to take. Among the most common trips that fall into the obli-cation category are for birthdays (a total of $32 billion, or $137 per person a year), weddings ($20 billion, or $89 per person a year), reunions ($11 billion, or $50 per person a year) and wedding and baby showers ($7 billion, or $33 per person a year), according to the survey, conducted by Harris Poll, which questioned 2,000 U.S. adults.So why don’t we just say no to trips we feel less than psyched to take? “People are polite, and social norms are a big factor here,” says Henrik Kjellberg, president of the Hotwire Group. What’s more, not only do we have to pay for the travel to events like these, we also often have to bring gifts or buy new clothes — further adding to our tab. The average wedding guest in America, for example, spends a little over $100 on the gift, according to data from American Express released this year — and that’s before she shells out for a new dress so her friends don’t comment on her innate ability to “recycle” her clothes.To be sure, the costs of obli-cations are small compared with the $621 billion Americans spend on leisure travel each year, according to U.S. Travel. And it isn’t like obligatory trips are always a snooze (come on, after a few cocktails, even Old Aunt Mildred’s wedding was kind of fun.).Still, these kinds of trips can take a bite out of your wallet — and since you usually can’t control the timing or the venue (two of the biggest ways to save money on travel), you have to get more creative on ways to save. Here are some expert tips on how to do that.AccommodationsTo make sure you have a hotel room, book it well in advance of the trip, noting the hotels’ cancellation policy (it’s typically 24 hours), says Kjellberg. But then, he says, look for last-minute hotel deals right before your trip is taking place, which can cut the rate by half or more. Hotwire offers last-minute hotel deals, as does HotelTonight and Hotels.com. There are also often last-minute deals through home-sharing sites like AirBnB.com and HomeAway.com as homeowners try to unload unsold inventory.Kendal Perez, a blogger for Hassle-Free Savings , recommends trying to buy a discounted gift card on a site like Gift Card Granny for BedandBreakast.com , which lists thousands of bed-and-breakfasts throughout the country.FlightsThere are a bunch of tricks to booking flights (some say to book on Tuesday afternoons, well in advance; we like Hopper.com for insight on when to book and with whom, and recommend creating fare alerts with the travel search engines). But here’s a trick you might not realize you should try: clearing your cache. “When people are looking to book flights they should clear their cache if they look more than once before booking on the same flight-booking website, or use the incognito mode in their Web browser when booking,” says Sam Bruce, the co-founder of MuchBetterAdventures.com . “This is because some flight sites track your activity and push the prices up to encourage you to book sooner rather than later.”Rental carsIf the big-name companies are pricey, you should look to smaller brands like Fox, Payless and Advantage and check out off-airport locations as well as package hotel deals.Also see:7 cruises for people who hate cruises6 ways to escape children on a cruise ship10 things all-inclusives won’t tell you	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B7756252-FBE7-11E3-9C64-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

Etihad to buy 49% stake in Alitalia	By Rory JonesEarlier this month, Etihad said it would invest in Alitalia if a number of conditions were met, ending months of negotiations over the future of the near-bankrupt Italian carrier.In a joint statement on Wednesday, the airlines said they would complete the transaction as soon as possible. No details were given about the conditions or the size of the investment being made by Etihad.Italian Infrastructure Minister Maurizio Lupi said earlier this month that Etihad was looking to invest €560 million ($761.6 million) and had pledged to invest a further €690 million in the airline over the next four years in various guises. Etihad was also planning to cut Alitalia’s workforce by 2,251 to 11,470, Lupi said.The investment will give Etihad access to the Italian market, and potentially deepen its foothold in Europe, where the airline already has a stake in Air Berlin PLC /quotes/zigman/415935/delayed DE:AB1 +0.42%  and a revenue-sharing partnership with Air France-KLM SA /quotes/zigman/127901/delayed FR:AF -1.70% , which holds a 7% stake in Alitalia.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.comMore must-reads from MarketWatch:Lynn: Draghi’s monetary blitz has failed to lift the euro zoneU.S. to allow shipments of crude overseas10 laggard stocks that may get a huge M&A premium	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=AAE20294-FC4A-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-25

Should you move to Detroit?	By Quentin FottrellDetroit has had some votes of confidence lately. On Tuesday, Steve Case, co-founder of AOL and the chairman and chief executive of Revolution LLC, a Washington-based venture-capital firm, will kick-start his “Rise of the Rest” road trip in Detroit. He will announce a $100,000 prize for the winner of his pitch competition, before awarding a $100,000 prize to a company in each of these cities: Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Nashville. Last month, J.P. Morgan Chase, the country’s biggest bank, announced a $100 million investment in Detroit over the next five years. Last year, Google named Detroit a key tech hub.Ted Serbinski, a partner at Detroit Venture Partners, moved to Detroit in 2011 from San Francisco. “My wife and I were living in downtown San Francisco, and the costs were starting to get unruly,” he says. “I was looking for somewhere that isn’t as crowded. Coming here, I found a passion for helping to rebuild the society.” He read a lot of newspaper articles about crime in Detroit but wasnt put off by them. “The surprising thing to me is how misleading all those headlines were,” he says.“I call it the entrepreneurial gold rush and see more opportunities here than I ever did in San Francisco.”Indeed, Detroit is the fifth most affordable city in the U.S. for real estate, according to HSH.com, a mortgage-information firm. Residents only need to earn $32,250 a year for a median-priced home — making Detroit more expensive than only Cleveland ($29,788), Pittsburgh ($30,177), St. Louis ($31,275) and Cincinnati ($31,850). (San Francisco was the least affordable; median-price-home buyers need to earn $137,129 a year there.) More than 80% of homes for sale in Detroit are within reach of the middle class, compared with only 20% in New York and Los Angeles and 14% in San Francisco, according to real-estate website Trulia.It’s also possible to live large in Detroit. “The duplex house I lived in 35 years ago on Detroit’s east side is still a beauty,” says Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of the Economic Policy Institute and a resident of Washington, D.C. He recently revisited it: The home has two units, each with leaded-glass windows, fireplace, Florida room, walk-in pantry, two bedrooms and kitchen. It sold for less than $50,000 two years ago. The lot next door can be bought for $1,000. “Once Detroit gets through the bankruptcy, restores city services, and makes progress on job creation, it will be an amazing value,” he adds.That might be a big ask, however. Detroit currently has the highest unemployment rate of the 50 largest cities in the U.S., at more than three times the national average for May, which was 6.3%. The unemployment rate there hovers at 23%, six percentage points ahead of the nearest on the list — Oakland City, Calif., at 16.9%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And Detroit was last among urban school districts of the 21 cities that participated in “The Nation’s Report Card: 2013 Mathematics and Reading Trial Urban District Assessment” for fourth- and eighth-grade reading and math.It also has one of the highest tax burdens for high earners, the Office of Revenue Analysis of the Government of Washington, D.C., found. The city ranked No. 9 out of 51 for a family of three earning $100,000 a year ($12,991) and No. 18 for a family earning $25,000 a year ($3,421). But Eisenbrey says there’s more to Detroit. “The riverfront is beautiful. The boating and fishing are great. I have a lifelong love affair with the Eastern Market and the Detroit Tigers,” he says. And lest we forget: the Detroit Opera House, Detroit Symphony, Detroit Institute of Arts and 56 years of the Detroit Repertory Theater.Detroit has a healthier ranking when it comes to starting a business, according to personal-finance website WalletHub , which rated the city No. 27 out of 150 based on metrics such as the five-year survival rates of businesses, the number of businesses per capita, real-estate affordability and variety of industries. Another reason: New hires are likely to work for less pay than in other parts of the U.S. due to the high rate of unemployment, but also the relatively low cost of living. The median household income in Detroit is $25,193, according to the Census Bureau. That’s half the national average. Also read: Why Detroit’s $1,000 houses might be a lousy deal.Even if large businesses have struggled in Detroit, “it has a lot of small businesses on a per capita basis, showing that it’s more entrepreneurial,” says Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of WalletHub. Detroit rated No. 1 for employee availability — the number of unemployed people adjusted for the number of job openings. “If you are going to start a business, you won’t have a hard time finding people,” he says. There’s also a burgeoning technology industry; tech employment rose 15% in 2013, adding 30,000 jobs, according to a report by Automation Alley, a technology business association in Troy, Mich.Michigan is one of the few places in the U.S. that’s seeing a rise in venture-capital investment, Serbinski says. The Madison Bloc, a tech hub housing venture capitalists, startups, a co-working space and high-tech training, “is really the catalyst downtown.” Culturally, he says, “Detroit is not like a New York or San Francisco, but it’s changing very quickly. Mayor Duggan, elected in January, was a write-in candidate whose name didn’t appear on the ballot, he adds: “He’s had a huge impact on the city, improving the city’s technical infrastructure to blight removal.”Flint and Detroit remain the top two most violent U.S. cities with a population of 100,000 or more, based on Federal Bureau of Investigation data. In 2012, Detroit had 2,123 violent crimes per 100,000 (versus 2,729 for Flint). “You won’t see crime go down overnight,” says Ellis Stafford, operations director for the Detroit Crime Commission. “Gangs are no different than Jenga. You take out the right pieces, and you can disrupt the game.” But Detroit was rated the No. 1 safest city in the U.S. by Homeownersinsurance.com — although that was referring to the number of natural disasters (not crimes) over a 10-year period.Other articles by Quentin Fottrell:Want the American dream?

U.S. stocks fall; Dow in triple-digit loss	By Anora Mahmudova, MarketWatchSome analysts pointed to escalation in Iraq as a possible trigger, while others said that it was a mere profit-taking at the end of the quarter.The S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.55%  ended the session 12.63 points, or 0.6%, lower, after briefly touching an intraday record. Energy sector stocks were hit the hardest, with the sub sector down 2%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.54% dropped 119.13 points, or 0.7%, to 16,813.13. The Nasdaq Composite /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP +0.63%  lost 18.32 points, or 0.4%, to 4,350.36. As selling intensified, the CBOE Vix index /quotes/zigman/2766221/delayed VIX -4.62%   jumped 10% to above 12.Read the recap of MarketWatch’s live blog of today’s stock-market action .“Investors have generally paid little attention to the fighting in Iraq. But stocks dropped today due to the possibility of escalating violence and slightly higher oil prices,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones.Channing Smith, managing director at Capital Advisors, doubted it was Iraq news that triggered a selloff.“If Iraq is a concern, why energy sector is sharply down? I think markets simply have been overbought and are now taking a breather, with investors taking profit at the end of the quarter” Channing said.Stocks initially rose on the back of positive economic reports, including new-home sales, home prices and consumer confidence data, but gains evaporated by afternoon.New U.S. homes sold at an annual rate of 504,000 in May to mark the fastest increase in six years, the government said Tuesday. Yet the surprising gain -- economists polled by MarketWatch expected a 440,000 increase -- was led by a huge surge in the Northeast. Sales of existing homes in May hit the fastest pace in seven months.Home prices rose in April as the spring selling season got underway, even as annual growth skidded, dropping to the slowest pace in more than a year, according to data released Tuesday morning. April data show that home-price growth has turnedS&P/Case-Shiller’s price barometer tracking 20 cities showed that year-over-year price growth hit 10.8% in April — a fast pace but down sharply from annual growth of 12.4% in March and a recent peak of 13.7% in November.A gauge of consumer confidence rose to 85.2 in June -- the highest level since January 2008 -- from 82.2 in May, the Conference Board Tuesday.In corporate news, cruise company Carnival Corp. /quotes/zigman/322132/delayed/quotes/nls/ccl CCL +0.83%  beat consensus profit and revenue estimates and raised its full-year outlook.

Treasurys rally amid Iraq escalation	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR 0.00%  yield, which falls as prices rise, was down 4 basis points at 2.583%. The yield is the benchmark for a wide range of borrowing costs around the world.Treasury prices got a boost after reports in The Wall Street Journal that Syrian warplanes hit targets in western Iraq.“I think the headline spooked the market a bit and there was some short covering,” said Sean Murphy, senior Treasurys trader at Société Générale.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR 0.00%  yield fell 4.5 basis points on the day to 3.400% while the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR 0.00%  yield fell 3 basis points to 1.674%.The violence didn’t inhibit a $30 billion sale of 2-year Treasury notes /quotes/zigman/4868354/delayed 2_YEAR 0.00% , which has risen sharply in recent months.The 2-year notes sold at a yield of 0.511%, below where the broader market was trading at the time. Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks, bought 23.1% of the sale, compared to an average of 27.9 times in the last six sales. Direct bidders, which include domestic money managers, bought 23.3% of the sale, versus the average of 22.9%.Bidders offered to buy 3.23 times the amount of debt for sale, compared to a recent average of 3.46 times.Treasurys have been mostly trading in a narrow range as investors seek more clarity on the pace of U.S. economic growth, and how it will shape monetary policy. The Federal Reserve last week reaffirmed its commitment to the low-rate policies that have been aimed at supporting the economy in recent years. Nonetheless, some fear that a recent rise in inflation may force the Fed to shift its guidance sooner than expected. That has renewed investor focus on economic data for readings on growth.“I believe we are closing in on our goals, perhaps faster than some people might think,” said Charles Plosser, the president of the Philadelphia Fed, in a speech on Tuesday.Data on Tuesday was mixed. The Conference Board said Tuesday that consumer confidence rose to 85.2 in June from 82.2 in May. The reading, the highest since the beginning of 2008, beat expectations of 83.5.New U.S. homes sold at an annual rate of 504,000 in May, according to data released Tuesday. That increase was well above estimates of a 440,000 rise, according to MarketWatch-polled economists.Treasurys had risen after the S&P/Case-Shiller’s 20-city composite index showed a 1.1% rise in April, though annual growth slowed down to a rate of 10.8% in April, the slowest in over a year. The market began rising in morning trade amid disappointing German business confidence data and dovish comments from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.On Wednesday, a revision to first-quarter GDP is due, and personal consumption expenditure data is due out on Thursday.

Groupon, Micron notable gainers in off day for tech	By Rex Crum, MarketWatchGroupon /quotes/zigman/7212269/delayed/quotes/nls/grpn GRPN +2.62%  pulled back from its high point, but still closed with a gain of 4.5% at $6.78 to add to the prior-day’s gains. On Monday, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said recent checks show Groupon has increased the number of deals available on its site, and is taking more steps in its turnaround to become more of a destination for e-commerce consumers.Munster said Groupon has increased the number of deals on its network to 200,000 from about 140,000 at the end of 2013, and he expects the company to reach 500,000 deals within three to four years.Micron /quotes/zigman/75433/delayed/quotes/nls/mu MU -0.09%  rose 4% to end the day at $32.50 a share after the memory chipmaker reported better-than-expected quarterly results late Monday.Online radio company Pandora Media Inc. /quotes/zigman/5419837/delayed/quotes/nls/p P -0.91%  edged up by 7 cents a share to close at $28.27. Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said that recent meetings with Pandora have given him “renewed confidence in Pandora’s ability to exceed our revenue targets over time.”Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +0.59%  ended the day down by 55 cents a share to close at $90.28 following reports that said the company is set to begin production of the so-called iPhone 6 in China next month. The newest version of Apple’s smartphone will reportedly come out in two models, with screen sizes of 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, and will ship in September. If such reports are true, the next release would fall in line with Apple’s historical pattern of introducing a new iPhone in time for the annual Christmas and holiday shopping seasons.If Apple does increase the size of its iPhone screens, it would add to the arms race that has developed around bigger screens for smartphones. Apple rivals such as Samsung and HTC have released phones with screens of up to 5.7 inches, and last week, Amazon.com Inc. /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN +1.39%  unveiled its Fire phone with a 4.7-inch screen.Google Inc. /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%  shed $1.75 a share to close at $572.54 in advance of the company’s annual I/O developers conference, which starts Wednesday in San Francisco.

Pound below $1.70 as rate-hike timing questioned	By Saumya Vaishampayan, MarketWatchBOE Gov. Mark Carney highlighted the U.K.’s tepid wage growth in testimony to lawmakers, which indicates that there is still slack in the labor market. That could prompt the BOE to hold off on its first interest-rate hike, as it now looks at an array of labor-market indicators in deciding when to tighten monetary policy. Carney also said that once interest rates do begin to move, the change will be gradual.Market participants were “left with the view that the BOE is going to raise interest rates and raise them before the Fed does, but that will be a 2015 event, not 2014 [event],” said Michael Woolfolk, global markets strategist at BNY Mellon.The pound /quotes/zigman/4867886/realtime/sampled GBPUSD +0.0221%  fell to $1.6987 from $1.7025 late Monday.Carney’s remarks contrasted with those in his annual Mansion House speech earlier this month, when he said interest-rate hikes could come sooner than the markets expect. Higher U.K. interest rates would make pound-denominated investments more attractive.The dollar /quotes/zigman/4868099/realtime/sampled USDJPY -0.1201%  traded in tight ranges against the yen, buying ¥101.93 versus ¥101.90 late Monday. Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday introduced another round of economic reforms as part of his efforts to revitalize the Japanese economy.The ICE dollar index /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY +0.07% , which pits the greenback against six rivals, was at 80.311 versus 80.270 late Monday. The WSJ Dollar Index /quotes/zigman/9625991/realtime XX:BUXX +0.03% , an alternate gauge of dollar strength, inched up to 73.04 from 72.98.Data released Tuesday showed a 1.1% rise in U.S. home prices in April, according to S&P/Case-Shiller’s 20-city composite index. New-home sales surged 19% in May, with the annual rate hitting a six-year high.

Dow falls over 100 points; energy stocks sell off: Stock market live blog recap	We live blogged the U.S. stock market’s action Tuesday.

Yet the surprising gain – economists polled by MarketWatch expected a 440,000 increase – was led by a huge surge in the Northeast.And for the confidence figure:A gauge of consumer confidence rose to 85.2 in June — the highest level since January 2008 — from 82.2 in May, the Conference Board Tuesday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a June reading of 83.5 …Stocks have strengthened after those two reports, with the S&P 500 and Dow turning postive.So we’ve got a new intraday record for the S&P 500.S&P 500 +0.03%Dow +0.03%Nasdaq +0.3%Russell 2000 +0.1%Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed /quotes/nls/aapl AAPL is up 0.7%, helping the tech-heavy Nasdaq to its 0.5% gain while the S&P 500 rises just 0.1%.There’s some iPhone news today.Apple plans to begin the production in China next month of new iPhones with larger screens, expected to ship to retailers in September, Bloomberg News reported late Monday, citing unidentified sources familiar with the plans.That’s a picture of the new larger phone.

It’s down nearly 8% this week, and it’s lost 17% in June to date.MarketWatch also has the following story:Dubai stocks slumped on Tuesday, extending recent losses, as margin selling triggered a wider selloff amid growing ownership concerns at one of its main construction companies.The emirate’s stock market has been among the top risers globally since early 2013, buoyed by a rebounding economy on the back of strengthening trade and tourism and a sharp recovery in its property prices, which had crashed 50% in the wake of the global financial crisis.Investor sentiment was further boosted by Dubai winning the rights late last year to host the World Expo in 2020, and the United Arab Emirates, of which it is a part, being promoted to emerging-market status by index compiler MSCI in May.But shares listed on the Dubai bourse have fallen sharply since hitting a multiyear high early last month.Iraq concerns also are a factor. Read more here.“Low volatility continues to be the watchword of global financial markets,” writes Richard Gilhooly of TD Securities in a note. That was apparent in the bitcoin market as well on Tuesday, with CoinDesk’s bitcoin price index essentially flat on the day at $587.33. Sam Stovall, Managing Director, US Equity Strategy at S&P Capital IQ says that the economy is not falling into recession and the stock market is not about to fall into bear market.“Housing starts are strong and do not indicate we are about to fall into a recession. The yield curve is not signalling a bear market.”Sam Stovall: “A lot of  people think that rising rates are bad for stocks. But historically the opposite is true.Since 1948, when 10-year yields rose – up until the 6% ‘sand in the line’ – stocks rose for months too. That’s because when rates rise, investors move out of bonds and put money into stocks.The rise in yields means the economy is improving, so that’s good for earnings and PE multiples and ultimately for stocks.So, stocks are are beneficiaries of rising rates.”Analysts are penciling in a surge in earnings growth in the second half of this year. FactSet has broken down the figures and found that financials are expected to make the most impressive acceleration, though telecoms are expected to remain the overall growth leaders.

The greater number of goals is being blamed in part on hotter weather.Just as the World Cup has been heating up, increasing the risk of player mistakes, the world consumer price index (CPI) has also been heating up, complicating the task for policymakers at the world’s central banks and increasing the risk of mistakes that could have market implications. Stocks are on track for fresh record highs.

Prices have now tallied a five-session gain of nearly 4%.Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, says that the stock market reflects the general economy.“Economic data have been positive, but not good enough to boost confidence among investors. The geopolitical situation is worrying, but markets aren’t seeing at as a catalyst for a selloff.Speaking about low volatility, Warne said that it is not a sign of complacency, but rather cautious optimism.“Investors have a slightly positive view and we are likely to see markets grind higher.”Stocks were higher on the day this morning, until about 12:30 p.m. when sentiment turned sour.One of the explanations for that, the situation in Iraq is getting out of hand.From WSJ:Syrian warplanes struck targets in the western Iraqi province of Anbar on Tuesday, killing at least 50 people as foreign allies of Baghdad’s Shiite-dominated government sought to shore up the crumbling Iraqi armed forces and curb the advances of Sunni insurgents.More than 132 other people were also wounded when bombs hit the municipal building, a market and a bank in the district of Al Rutba, according to a provincial official and Mohammed Al Qubaisi, a doctor in the district’s main hospital.  Eric Zoldan, Certified Investment Management Analyst at JHS Capital Advisors thinks so. He sees a number of risks, including rising interest rates and geopolitical risks, that could derail corporate earnings growth.Stocks are at session lows, with only the Nasdaq Composite hanging onto small gains.S&P 500 -0.27%Dow -0.44%Nasdaq +0.1%The hardest hit sector on the S&P 500 is the energy sector, specifically oil exploration companies.Pioneer Natural Resources .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/185808/delayed /quotes/nls/pxd PXD  -3.7%Nabors Industries .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/306432/delayed /quotes/nls/nbr NBR -03.6%EOG Resources .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/248503/delayed /quotes/nls/eog EOG  -3.2% Oil futures settled a bit lower, but prices managed to keep their grip on the $106-a-barrel level on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Traders awaited weekly reports on U.S. petroleum supplies from the American Petroleum Institute later Tuesday and from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday morning.Analysts polled by Platts expect to see a decline of 2 million barrels in crude inventories for the week ended June 20.August crude oil .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/2196851/realtime CLQ4 fell 14 cents, or 0.1%, to settle at $106.03 a barrel on Nymex.The pound fell to $1.6983 in recent trade, snapping a three-session streak of trading above $1.70.

(Carney had previously said the first rate hike could come sooner than the markets expect.) Of course, market participants still expect the BOE to hike rates before the Federal Reserve, which should boost the pound against the dollar.  A quick look at today’s winner s on the S&P 500:Vertex Pharmaceuticals .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/79675/delayed /quotes/nls/vrtx VRTX  +40% Micron Technology .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/75433/delayed /quotes/nls/mu MU  +4.2%Weyerhaeuser Company .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/246093/delayed /quotes/nls/wy WY  +3.1%Google /quotes/zigman/93888/delayed /quotes/nls/googl GOOGL will be in focus on Wednesday with the tech giant hosting its annual developers conference in San Francisco where it is expected to show off new enhancements for its operating system.The buzz in the geek world is that Google will introduce easier ways to multitask with Android, including a shortcut to use certain apps without having to open those programs, according to MarketWatch’s Rex Crum.There are also rumors that Google may be entering domain registration business with the launch of a beta program although information is sparse, according to analyst Sterling Auty at J.P.

It still makes sense to go to college, Fed study says	By Mark Peters and Douglas BelkinThe answer isn’t so clear.As states for the first time mine certain degree data from public colleges, they are finding salaries for holders of associate degrees in a technical field are outstripping many of those with four-year degrees, at least early in a career.The growing body of data, from states including Texas, Colorado and Indiana, takes a sober new look at the value of a postsecondary education in a slowly recovering economy.Overall, the findings reinforce a college degree is worth it. But they highlight the reconsideration of a long-held article of faith that a four-year college degree is the surest ticket to the middle class and an associate degree is its poor country cousin.In Indiana, figures show after a year in the workforce a graduate of Ivy Tech Community College on average makes more than a similar graduate of the Indiana University.In Colorado, Tessa DeVore earned a two-year nursing degree from Front Range Community College in 2010. The degree cost her $23,000, but her starting salary was $53,000.“At my hospital, the salary doesn’t increase any faster if you have a four-year degree,” she said. “For me, this was absolutely the way to go.”A New York Federal Reserve study released Tuesday found that both associates and four-year degrees remain solid investments, even as the cost of going to school rapidly escalates and real wages decline for graduates.New York Federal Reserve Bank economists Jaison Abel and Richard Deitz in the new study calculated the return on investment for a college degree, pegging it at about 15% for current graduates. The figure, which far surpasses typical returns for stocks and bonds, has held largely constant for more than a decade.Surprisingly, the economists find the return on a bachelor’s and associate degree is largely the same and has remained that way for several decades. The difference in wages between the two degrees also has remained relatively constant, with a bachelor’s degree holder currently making annually about $65,800 and an associate’s holder making about $46,300.Degree-holders of all stripes shouldn’t rejoice just yet. Helping to keep up the value of all college degrees are the declining prospects for those without one. Real wages for high-school graduates have been falling, helping to keep the earnings premium for a college degree near its all-time high. At the same time, the lower wages mean workers lose less in earnings by exiting the workforce to get a degree.An expanded version of this story is available at WSJ.com	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=10B089B4-FBD9-11E3-AE23-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24
Your money manager doesn’t need tougher regulation	By Douglas M. HodgeThis is especially true for the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or the “FSOC” , a creation of the Dodd-Frank Act, which is charged with the extraordinary task of identifying and taking action to reduce systemic risk. To this end, the FSOC has the authority to designate certain non-bank entities as “systemically important financial institutions,” or “SIFIs,” which are subject to prudential regulation, such as capital requirements and supervision by the Federal Reserve.As stewards of retirement assets for millions of individuals and thousands of institutions, PIMCO’s business depends on well-functioning global capital markets and as a company we welcome the government’s focus on facilitating a more stable financial infrastructure. Yet the concern is that the FSOC — with its seemingly singular focus on SIFI designation of large entities, such as asset managers, and its associated opaque processes — is in fact drifting from its goal of reducing systemic risk.The worry is that the designation of asset management firms as SIFIs would not improve financial stability and would in fact result in unintended and undesirable consequences. PIMCO is concerned not because the firm is reflexively against regulation — in fact, as fiduciaries and registered advisers, the asset management industry already operates in a highly regulated world. It’s that the designation of asset managers would represent bad public policy and would inevitably harm investors.How? While the FSOC has yet to promulgate the policy measures to which SIFI asset managers would be subject, those it may consider, such as capital requirements and measures to limit redemption activity, could fundamentally and adversely alter the relationship asset managers have with their clients. At the center of that relationship is the fiduciary duty of an asset manager to clients — a binding legal obligation to function solely in their best interests.By requiring certain SIFI funds to hold more capital (e.g., more cash), for instance, an asset manager’s ability to optimize the return and risk objectives of its clients — and function in their best interest – would necessarily be hampered. The practical effect would be that the savers and retirees invested in those funds would suffer, either from diminished performance, or if they felt compelled to select another manager, from a smaller universe of asset managers from which to choose.Asset manager designation would not only hurt millions of savers and create winners and losers in the asset management industry, but it also would not reduce systemic risk. Unlike banks, which as entities arguably do give rise to systemic risk, asset managers function as agents that manage other people’s money and do not trade for their own account.Moreover, asset managers typically have small balance sheets, even though the “assets under management” may be large, which underscores a key distinction: Assets under management represent someone else’s assets. Each client account represents a separate legal entity to which an asset manager has no legal claim, and each client has its own distinct return and risk objectives for its assets that are held at a third-party custodian bank. Moreover, unlike banks, asset managers do not depend on leverage as part of their business model. For these reasons, asset managers as entities pose little systemic risk.History would validate the argument that asset managers are not sources of systemic risk. No traditional asset manager was at the heart of the financial crisis, and of the more than 700 recipients of TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) money, not one was an asset manager. To our knowledge, no mutual fund with a floating net asset value was unable to meet redemptions during the crisis. In many cases, asset managers were not only able to protect, but to grow their client assets in the aftermath of the financial crisis.Of course, the FSOC has little use for previous crises; it is more concerned with future risks. And while there are risks in the asset management industry, those risks are not consolidated in particular entities. The FSOC goals would be better served if it considered the activities within the capital markets that give rise to systemic risk. Activities, such as excessive leverage and liquidity transformation, bear more study and possible policy recommendations on an industry-wide basis.This framework approach is consistent with years of capital market regulation. PIMCO hopes that as the FSOC spends more time engaging with the industry and its primary regulators, it will conclude that asset managers do not pose systemic risk. Instead, the FSOC, our clients and the system as a whole would be better served by focusing on industry-wide, activities-based policies, which have served the country well for years.Douglas M. Hodge is CEO of asset management firm PIMCO.

Short-lived correction threatens overbought market	By Lawrence G. McMillanIn a bull market, he would be counseling short sellers, of course. The same logic works in the other direction: Oversold markets can continue to decline sharply — and from Keynes’ point of view, it would be those who were long stocks that would be bemoaning the irrational nature of an oversold market.This topic is apropos because nearly all of the major market indicators that we follow are overbought. Yet the market plods onward and upward — ignoring a seasonally bearish factor in the process.The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.55% is a case in point. The chart is bullish, as it is in a clear uptrend. Last week’s tiny pullback didn’t even reach the rising 20-day moving average. What has occurred, though, is that SPX has risen above the +4-standard deviation “modified Bollinger Band” (mBB), and that is an overbought state. SPX is on the verge of generating an mBB sell signal (which occurs when SPX falls below the +3-sigma Band, which entered today at 1,959, but is rising at the rate of about 3 SPX points a day).The equity-only put-call ratios have been declining steadily, at a rather rapid pace. As long as they are declining, that’s bullish for stocks. However, the ratios are now reaching the lower ranges of their charts, and that presents an overbought condition too. You can see from the graph that the put-call ratio is now down to nearly where it was this past January — the lowest price on the chart. However, this wont evolve into a sell signal until the ratio rolls over and begins to rise.Market breadth (advances minus declines) has been very strong since SPX broke out to new highs, over the 1,900 level, about a month ago. It’s positive for breadth to get and stay overbought when a new bullish leg begins, but now the momentum has slowed down and the overbought condition is on the verge of causing breadth sell signals. One or two days of negative breadth would generate sell signals.As an aside, it should be pointed out that cumulative breadth (i.e., the running sum of daily advances minus declines) recently registered new all-time highs, at the same time as SPX (and other major indexes) did. That is positive confirmation of those all-time highs and should indicate that the major trend is still bullish, despite any corrections that might be generated by the overbought conditions.Volatility indexes (VXST) /quotes/zigman/2766221/delayed VIX -4.62% /quotes/zigman/2772139/delayed XX:VXV -2.00% have dropped to extremely low levels in the past week or so. VXST traded at a new all-time low (although it should be noted that its price history only goes back a few years, since the index was only recently invented by the CBOE). VIX dropped below 11, which is an extremely low level. At face value, these low levels of volatility indicate an overbought condition, and may claim they are indications of investor complacency. However, in late 2005, 2006, and early 2007, VIX remained at low levels for long periods while SPX rallied. Hence, once again, “overbought doesnt mean sell.” What would be bearish is if VIX closed above 13 (see accompanying chart).I am not one who thinks the low VIX necessarily means that traders are complacent. Rather a low VIX is reflective of the low levels of actual market volatility. The 20-day historical volatility of SPX is below 7. So, with VIX near 11, it is trading at a very healthy premium to realized volatility. Moreover, the VIX futures trade at even higher prices than that. So the “complacency” argument doesn’t really hold water. In fact, we see heavy activity in SPY puts and VIX calls — instruments which are typically bought for protection. Complacent investors wouldn’t bother spending money on protection.Finally, there is a seasonal factor at work this week: SPX has declined in 18 of the past 24 years, in the week following June option and futures expiration (that expiration was last Friday, June 20).In summary, the market indicators that we follow continue to remain on buy signals, indicating that the intermediate-term is bullish. However, they are all in various stages of being overbought, so a sharp, but probably short-lived correction looms at any time. The key support area of 1,900 on SPX should be able to hold during any such correction.If that level were to be violated, then “correction” might evolve into something worse.Lawrence G.

That would mark the largest consumer-electronics IPO since battery company Duracell International Inc.’s 1991 debut, according to Dealogic.

Oil futures slip, but keep grip on $106 a barrel	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchTraders continued to keep a close watch on developments in Iraq for any potential disruptions to global supplies and awaited weekly data on U.S. petroleum supplies.West Texas Intermediate crude oil for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.28%  fell 14 cents, or 0.1%, to settle at $106.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while August Brent /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -0.38% , the European benchmark, climbed 34 cents, or 0.3%, to end at $114.46 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.Part of the pull back in Nymex oil prices late in the trading session was likely due to positioning ahead of a U.S. government report on supplies, “as last week’s inventory data was rather bearish,” said Tyler Richey, an analyst for the 7:00’s Report, which offers daily markets commentary.The American Petroleum Institute was set to release a report on petroleum supplies late Tuesday, while the Energy Information Administration’s data were due out Wednesday.Analysts surveyed by Platts expect the reports to show a drawdown of 2 million barrels in crude supplies for the week ended June 20. They are also looking for a climb of 2 million barrels in gasoline stockpiles and a rise of 1 million barrels for distillate inventories, which include heating oil.July gasoline , the front-month contract, rose nearly 2 cents, or 0.6%, to $3.13 a gallon, while July heating oil  ended at $3.04 a gallon, up a cent, or 0.3%.For now, WTI crude is “continuing to trade comfortably above former resistance (which is now support) at $105,” Richey said. “There is no question that Iraq was the reason behind the break-out and the conflict continues to help support prices.”“At the end of the day, the U.S. economy is growing and that is the primary driver of the energy markets over the longer term, as more and more people are entering the work force ... and are driving to work,” he said.U.S. data released Tuesday showed that consumers are the most confident they’ve been since early in the recession, with a gauge of consumer confidence rising to 85.2 in June, the highest since January 2008. Sales of new homes also surged nearly 19% in May to the highest annual level in six years.Still, analysts said signs that violence has swept across northern Iraq as government forces battle Sunni insurgents hasn’t yet affected the country’s oil exports. That was helping to keep a lid on prices after both WTI and Brent crude benchmarks last week hit their highest levels in nine months. Oil futures retreated on Monday.“If there is confirmation that ISIS extremists will not be able to disrupt the oil supply, prices are likely to fall further. The ongoing uncertainty means that no sharp price slide is likely, however. In the next few weeks, we expect to see Brent trading at above $110 per barrel,” said analysts at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, in a note.Abdulah Al-Badry, the secretary-general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, on Tuesday said Iraq is still “producing as normal,” with 95% of its capacity in the south unaffected by the violence , the Associated Press reported.Developments in Ukraine might also put downward pressure on energy prices, analysts said. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday asked parliament to rescind his authorization to use military force in Ukraine, a day after pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine agreed to join a government-declared cease-fire until the end of the week. Putin’s move was welcomed by Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko.Rounding out the energy action on Nymex, prices for natural gas rebounded after suffering from declines over the past four trading sessions in a row.July natural gas climbed 9 cents, or 2%, to settle at $4.535 per million British thermal units.Recent weakness for the natural gas came as a “result of the last 6 consecutive EIA reports showing builds of 100 [billion cubic feet] or more, easing some concerns over whether or not inventories would be restored to levels needed to comfortably enter the draw season this fall,” said the 7:00’s Report’s Richey. “Also, revisions to extended weather forecasts that suggests temperatures will be milder than initially expected are lowering energy demand expectations for the near term.”This is what needs to happen for gold to rallyAre we setting up for a 2011-type crash?Goldman Sachs: 15 cheap stocks for an expensive market	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=77A8EE38-FB96-11E3-AE23-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

Google’s Android, Glass in focus at I/O developer conference	By Rex Crum, MarketWatchLike Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +0.59% , which showed off new features of iOS 8, the company’s mobile-device operating system, Google /quotes/zigman/93888/delayed/quotes/nls/googl GOOGL +0.39%  is expected to spend the majority of its keynote presentation unveiling the bells and whistles of the next upgrade to its Android OS.Among the speculation is that Google will unveil easier ways to multitask with Android, including a way to use certain apps without having to open those programs.Google will likely give an update on Google Glass, its smart-technology-based eyeglass product. Smartwatches developed under the Android Wear platform may also make an appearance. Google unveiled Android Wear back in March, and so far, Motorola and LG have said they will launch smartwatches based on Android Wear. Other developers such as Samsung reportedly will show off their devices at the I/O conference.None of these watches are on the market yet.“Wearables are some of the industry’s most innovative items” said Karl Volkman, chief technology officer of Chicago-based IT services provider SRV Network. “We can expect a renewed focus on Google Glass and its uses, including business and medical uses for the high-tech glasses.”Volkman added that Google may make a push for the health-technology market in an effort to compete with the HealthKit function that Apple showed off at its developers conference in early June.Google didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments about the conference, including who who will deliver the keynote presentation.The annual event comes during what has been a middling year, performance-wise, for Google’s stock, as the company’s shares have risen just 3.5% since the end of 2013. Google reported disappointing first-quarter results back in April, when it showed a decline in how much advertisers pay for each click on their ads.Forget the iWatch.

Tehran has deployed special forces to help protect the capital and the Iraqi cities of Najaf and Karbala, which Shiites revere.In recent days, Sunni militants led by the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham have seized key towns in Anbar province, a Sunni Muslim stronghold, giving them unchecked sway over hundreds of miles of territory spanning the Iraqi-Syrian border as they fight to carve out an Islamic emirate.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=67DD07CE-FBCC-11E3-9C64-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24
American Apparel explores ways to raise fresh funds	By Suzanne KapnerThe bankers are expected to apprise the board of its options in the coming days, the person said. Among the issues are whether the company /quotes/zigman/1511249/delayed/quotes/nls/app APP +4.82%  could raise fresh debt under its existing credit agreements and whether the company’s move to fire Chief Executive Dov Charney could force it to refinance existing loans, the person said.American Apparel is locked in a battle with Charney, the company’s founder, after the board last week stripped him of his chairmanship and moved to fire him as CEO once a 30-day period to resolve conflicts that is called for in his contract expires.Directors allege that Charney violated company policy by misusing funds and failing to stop the publication of naked photographs of a former employee who had sued him for sexual harassment, among other issues. Charney’s lawyer denounced the charges as baseless in a letter she sent to the board’s counsel, Jones Day.Last week, the board warned the move could put it in default on some of its debt. It said Monday it has hired Peter J. Solomon to ensure the company has “adequate access to capital in the future at a reasonable rate.”An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Drones are coming - invest or run screaming?Wake up!

There’s a big plus for speculators in this market	By Kevin MarderVolume has also been quiescent. For 30 of the past 31 trading days, Nasdaq turnover has been below its 50-day moving average.

Added to the wall of worry recently is concern over inflation. This is viewed as a substantial plus for the markets overall, as it lays to rest any semblance of a Japan-style deflationary meltdown.The purported pickup in inflation is not a concern for shares until interest-sensitive proxies diverge from blue-chip averages for at least a few months.

Gold scores fifth session gain in a row	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Gold futures settled with a modest rise on Tuesday to mark their fifth session gain in a row. Prices have returned to the all too familiar $1,300 level which is now to be considered initial support, said Tyler Richey, an analyst for the 7:00s Report. The gold market is beginning to focus more on inflation as multiple indicators have suggested that a bottom is in. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation. Combined with a seemingly eternally dovish Fed, the threat of a material uptick in inflation is increasing, he said. August gold /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.05% climbed $2.90, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,321.30 an ounce on Comex.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=076CACA4-0F68-4CDC-87A7-68D2F1122567&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24
How to read the bank stress test extension	By David Weidner, MarketWatchThat’s because the tests seem to be changing and evolving. Whether the changes are just fine tuning, or grasping will only become apparent in another credit crisis. So let’s hope we don’t find out.In that first round five years ago, the Fed found that 10 of the nations biggest banks needed $74.5 billion to shore up their balance sheets and that in a severe downturn could lose close to $600 billion. None of the major banks, including Citigroup Inc. /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C +0.48%  , Wells Fargo & Co. /quotes/zigman/239557/delayed/quotes/nls/wfc WFC +0.65%  and Bank of America Corp. /quotes/zigman/190927/delayed/quotes/nls/bac BAC +1.14%  were allowed to buy back stock or pay dividends. So, at least there was company in misery.And in not singling out any one institution, everyone seemed to pass.This year’s tests yielded improved results, the 30 biggest banks would lose $501 billion in a severe recession. Regulatory capital doubled from five years ago. And only a few banks, including Citigroup, were barred from buybacks and dividends.Now, the banks that didn’t make the cut are being granted an extension to file a new capital plan — how they will raise cash should they bit hit by loan losses or lose access to credit as they did in 2008 and 2009.The extension may suggest that the Fed is being to lenient, and perhaps bowing to investors tired of waiting for payouts. And what banking regulators may consider to be flexibility may seem to others to be a moving target .The bottom line is that no one really knows. And investors frustrated with the Fed and the bank stocks they hold should consider that the stress of a test, no matter how flawed, is better than the stress of a bank going insolvent in a crisis.Attack of the drones: Invest or run screaming?3 best stock picks for the drone revolution	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=85A925F8-FBBD-11E3-8AA5-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

U.K. stocks fall; pound down on dovish remarks	By Carla Mozee, MarketWatchThe pound, meanwhile, dropped against the U.S. dollar following dovish comments from the head of the Bank of England, Mark Carney.The FTSE 100 index /quotes/zigman/3173262/delayed UK:UKX +0.01% fell 0.2% to 6,787.07. It lost 0.4% on Monday, with real estate issues hurt ahead of expected proposals this week by the Bank of England aimed at paring the pace of growth in the country’s booming housing market.Figures released Tuesday from the British Bankers’ Association indicated slowing in the market has already started. U.K. mortgage lending in May grew by 1.2 billion pounds ($2.04 billion), compared with April’s £1.3 billion increase. Mortgage approvals totaled 41,757 in May, the lowest level since August.Shares of home builder Barratt Developments PLC /quotes/zigman/152374/delayed UK:BDEV -1.22% closed 1.6% lower, Persimmon PLC /quotes/zigman/155560/delayed UK:PSN -0.84%  lost 0.8%, and outside of the main index shares of Taylor Wimpey PLC /quotes/zigman/156565/delayed UK:TW 0.00% gave up 1%. Property developer British Land Co. /quotes/zigman/152699/delayed UK:BLND -1.42% , however, picked up 1.6%, wiping out Monday’s 1.5% decline.While policy makers at the Bank of England may “find it necessary to resort to rate hikes to address housing risks, it, we believe, might prove to be insufficient,” said ICICI Bank economist Nikhil Gupta in a Tuesday research report. “The government must expand efforts to increase the housing supply, without which it might prove extremely difficult to contain rising housing prices.”Bank of England Gov. Carney addressed the issue of interest rates on Tuesday. Subdued wage growth means there’s “room for additional spare capacity to be used up before we move [interest] rates,” he said in testimony to lawmakers.The pound /quotes/zigman/4867886/realtime/sampled GBPUSD +0.0221%  fell below the $1.70 level as Carney’s “dovish statements ... were a stark contrast to a week ago when he suggested that rates in U.K. could rise as early as this year,” wrote Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management. The pound bought $1.6969 compared with $1.7025 late Monday.The cautious tone of policy makers indicates that monetary authorities “remain far more concerned about stifling out the nascent recovery than about controlling any inflationary or asset bubble pressures,” said Schlossberg.A U.K. Treasury committee member during Carney’s testimony in London likened the Bank of England to an “unreliable boyfriend,” saying it’s been giving mixed signals on the future path of interest rates. “One day hot, one day cold, and the people on the other side of the message are left not really knowing where they stand,” the BBC quoted MP Pat McFadden as saying.Back to stocks, Carnival PLC /quotes/zigman/321074/delayed UK:CCL +0.45%  reported better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year adjusted earnings outlook, but shares of the cruise operator were pushed down 1.1%.Aviva PLC /quotes/zigman/153201/delayed UK:AV -0.86%  fell 1.1% after the insurer’s rating was cut to neutral from buy at UBS.“Aviva is no longer the compelling restructuring that a premium valuation deserves,” wrote UBS analyst James Shuck in a research note Tuesday. With Aviva’s “balance sheet now fixed and cash flow repaired, investors should be looking to earnings surprises to drive the shares higher from here.”Japans Abe unveils third arrow economic reformsThis is what needs to happen for gold to rallyMarkets linger where boredom and extreme optimism meet	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=2AC9EE50-FB87-11E3-8AA5-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24
Nasdaq breaks out, S&P 500 grinds higher	By Michael Ashbaugh, MarketWatchAgainst this backdrop, the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials have repeatedly notched all-time highs, while the Nasdaq Composite has reached its best levels since April 2000. The charts below add color:Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s hourly chart highlights the past two weeks.As illustrated, the S&P has sustained a slight break to record territory.From current levels, first support rests at the breakout point — S&P 1,955 — and is followed by a deeper floor around 1,942.Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ near-term backdrop is similar.Consider that the index notched a nominal record high in Friday’s action, and this week’s initial pullback has been flat.Near-term support holds around 16,900, and is followed by a deeper floor at 16,820.And the Nasdaq Composite is challenging 14-year highs.As this is written, the index has cleared notable resistance at 4,372, an area better illustrated on the daily chart below.Widening the view to six months adds perspective.On this wider view, significant overhead spans from the March peak of 4,371 to the June peak of 4,372. The recent selling pressure at resistance has been muted, improving the chances of an eventual sustained breakout.Moving to the Dow, its six-month backdrop remains constructive.Earlier this month, the index held first support at its breakout point — a level matching the May peak — before rising to a nominal record high. Bullish price action.And the S&P 500 has also edged to record territory.Here again, the S&P’s slight breakout follows a successful test of first support.Beyond the widely-tracked U.S. benchmarks, also consider recent strength elsewhere:Starting with the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF has rallied to two-month highs following a successful test of its breakout point.Recent strength places the IWM within striking distance of its record peak, the March high of 120.58.Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 reached a nominal record high last week.Its upturn follows a successful test of the breakout point, and the MDY’s path of least resistance points firmly higher barring a violation of this area. Consider that trendline support is rising to meet the breakout point.And returning to the S&P 500, the June range represents its latest plateau at record territory.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A55AC960-FBB8-11E3-8AA5-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

How I learned to stop worrying and love robot stocks	By Jeff ReevesConsider that while America has finally replaced the number of jobs lost in the Great Recession, quality jobs are still hard to come by. Take this, from the Wall Street Journal earlier this month:“The U.S. has 1.6 million fewer manufacturing jobs than when the recession began, but 941,000 more jobs in the accommodation and food-service sector. More than 40% of the jobs added in just the past year have come in generally lower-paying fields such as food service, retail and temporary help.”This is not a new story for investors. We’ve seen the charts showing a growing gap between productivity and wages. We’ve read the rehashing of (and rebuttals to) Thomas Piketty’s missive on inequality . In fact, it seems like the only jobs that are in plentiful supply these days are those held by pundits who talk about employment trends.Rather than waste words on employment and income — or get into the political ramifications of robots replacing humans — I’d rather focus on how to profit from this changing workforce dynamic. After all, if the manufacturing jobs are going away but the manufacturing work isn’t, somebody in charge of the technological means of productions is bound to make a pretty penny.Here’s how you can invest in the rise of our new robot overlords.IBMIBM /quotes/zigman/230066/delayed/quotes/nls/ibm IBM +0.07%  is the godfather of the earliest forms of workplace automation, finding its roots in companies that made timecard-punching machines in the 1880s and automatic data tabulation during World War II. The march toward automation has continued in the decades since, and so has IBM’s dominance in the industry.In health care, Watson is working on diagnosing patients and helping with clinical research. In education , Watson can help create custom-learning plans for students and help teachers assess performance. In finance, Watson can help judge investment risks and may even be deployed in Brazil soon to help with the unique challenges of high growth and high inflation.Heck, Watson can even argue with you if you want to question its logic.Computers already have replaced many manufacturing jobs that require simple manual labor and killed office jobs that require menial data entry. It’d seem like evaluating a cancer patient, middle-schooler or prospective homeowner demands a human touch, but with the wealth of data and the sophistication of computers like Watson, there is clearly plenty of room for high-tech tools to help out.IBM is on the cutting edge of that business.GoogleWhile Watson has gotten a lot of the press, Google /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41%  has the deep pockets and high-tech know-how to offer Big Blue a run for its money.Google is famous for its experimental projects, which include the Google Glass spectacles and a much-publicized self-driving car . But while these projects have been making the biggest splash, the tech giant has been quietly investing in robots.In the past several months, Google has snapped up a host of robotics and artificial-intelligence firms. There was Deep Mind , an artificial-intelligence firm it bought for $400 million that focuses on machine learning and not just computers that can sort data. There was also the purchase of robotics company Schaft, which won a recent Department of Defense competition that required humanoid robots to navigate disaster areas and carry out a series of relief tasks. Then there’s Redwood Robotics, a company that focuses on robotic arms for manufacturing and other repetitive uses.With roughly $60 billion in cash and investments on the books, and a history of ambitious acquisitions for both technology and talent, Google is agile enough to be seen as a serious competitor in almost any field of technology.And judging by recent moves, the folks in Mountain View have bigger automation plans on their mind than just a self-driving car.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5DB68432-F262-11E3-A740-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

European stocks turn lower, hurt by growth worries	By Carla Mozee, MarketWatchThe Stoxx Europe 600 index /quotes/zigman/2380150/delayed XX:SXXP -0.28%  fell 0.2% to 345.57, extending a 0.5% loss from Monday that came after a report of weakness in euro-zone business activity in June.The closely watched Ifo Institute survey released Tuesday showed business confidence in Europe’s largest economy fell more than expected in June, with companies expressing concern about the impact of political crises in both Ukraine and Iraq on future business activity. The Ifo’s lead indicator was 109.7 in June, compared with expectations of a 110.2 reading among economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires. In May, the reading was 110.4.“We clearly believe that this is a sign of worry which investors should factor in, as we already have the weaker PMI and German ZEW [economic sentiment] readings,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in a note.Germany’s DAX 30 equity index /quotes/zigman/2380246/delayed DX:DAX -0.20%  lost ground after the Ifo report, but managed a turnaround to end up 0.2% at 9,938.08.Last week, Germany’s ZEW economic sentiment indicator dropped to 29.8 points in June, missing a consensus projection of a 35 reading and marking a sixth straight month of declines.Lackluster growth along with low inflation prompted the European Central Bank earlier this month to enact stimulus measures, including cutting its deposit rate into negative territory to encourage lending by financial institutions.Among corporate movers, Syngenta shares /quotes/zigman/263744/delayed CH:SYNN +0.24%   surged 6% to the top of the Stoxx 600 following a Bloomberg report that Monsanto Co. /quotes/zigman/267799/delayed/quotes/nls/mon MON -0.0079%   had been considering a bid for the Swiss agrochemicals maker. The deal was abandoned after Syngenta’s management decided not to hold negotiations, Bloomberg reported.BMW shares /quotes/zigman/143329/delayed DE:BMW -0.48%  climbed 3.1% following a ratings upgrade for the luxury auto maker to buy from neutral at UBS, which cited near-term volume upside as one of the reasons for the move.But stock in Croda International PLC /quotes/zigman/153430/delayed UK:CRDA -0.67%   slid 9.1% after the chemicals company said strength in the British pound would leave its pretax profit for the second quarter 8% lower than in the first quarter.Among country indexes, the FTSE 100 index /quotes/zigman/3173262/delayed UK:UKX +0.01%  lost grip of gains and fell 0.2% to 6,787.07, and France’s CAC 40 index /quotes/zigman/3173214/delayed FR:PX1 -0.47%  picked up 0.1% at 4,518.34.Goldman Sachs: 15 cheap stocks for a pricey marketChina slams Morgan StanleyApple may ship new, larger iPhones in September: report	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=EF2A9FE8-FAE6-11E3-8AA5-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

Dont let Iraq scare you into buying gold	By Bill GundersonLast year, if you had a large allocation to small-cap U.S. stocks your performance was stellar. Gold on the other hand was down 27%, and the bond market was down 9% last year.So what about this year? Right now, one of the best places to be in the market is the energy sector in holdings like MLPs and oil and gas stocks. This year, certain foreign markets have also done well, such as Canada and emerging markets like Latin America and India. Emerging markets in particular, was a place to avoid last year.Being in the right asset classes at the right time is critical to achieving investment success. Of course, world events play a role in which asset classes are the right one to be in. With that in mind, Iraq is back in the headlines. The president has announced that we are sending in some advisors. When I think of advisors, I think of guys wearing suits and carrying briefcases, but these advisors are probably well armed. The situation in Iraq appears to be escalating.Typically in times of crisis, investors pile into gold. This past week, rising on the Iraq news, gold was up $22 an ounce.If I was a believer in asset allocation, I would advocate always having some gold in your portfolio. It is indeed a hedge against inflation, like rising food and energy prices and a way to protect yourself from a falling dollar.But is it time to buy gold now? When I look at the last five years, inflation is not really a problem with CPI stable at around 2%, and the U.S. dollar is not collapsing.Lets look at the facts and not the hype. Comparing the price performance of gold relative to the S&P 500 over the last five years, the S&P 500 was up more than 113% on a cumulative basis vs. only 38% for gold.The reality is that over the last five years, gold — repped here by the SPDR gold trust /quotes/zigman/41663/delayed/quotes/nls/gld GLD -0.42%  — has significantly underperformed the U.S. stock market, up only 6.7% per year vs. a 16.3% return for the S&P 500 Index. Over the last three years, gold has actually been down 5.4% on an annualized basis vs. a positive return of 15.5% for the S&P 500...............Data from Best Stocks Now app	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E5778B05-DE62-45D8-A187-4C6CE359D6D8&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24
If you haven’t cut the cord on cable TV, you should	By Nat WordenI’m a Cablevision Systems /quotes/zigman/221038/delayed/quotes/nls/cvc CVC +2.18%   customer in rural Connecticut, and I subscribed to the company’s “triple-play” Internet, TV and phone service for years. I’m a busy professional and a parent of small children, so I have little time for watching TV these days, and this service was expensive relative to my actual usage — except for the Internet service, which I need for all sorts of things.After purchasing Apple TV /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +0.59%  , it became clear that I no longer needed cable TV service, and I rarely used a wireline phone. When I called Cablevision to cancel those items, they kept me on hold for an eternity to connect to their “Retention Department,” which didn’t seem appropriate to me.When I finally got through, their representatives offered me several rounds of discounted promotional offerings to keep their TV service, which kept getting cheaper as I rejected them one after another. Then they gave up, and I returned my monstrous, electricity-draining cable box with it’s god-awful user interface and remote control that never worked (yes, I tried changing the batteries). That may have been the most satisfying errand I have ever run as a consumer.On Wall Street, this is known as “cord-cutting,” and it’s a trend that’s developing among consumers — particularly the young. Many analysts argue this is something that’s only happening on the margins, and it’s unlikely to affect the pay-TV business in a substantial way. I suspect they’re wrong, and that we’ll reach a tipping point in the not-too-distant future at which most consumers will decide the Internet is an adequate medium for serving all their entertainment and information needs and traditional pay-TV subscriptions are no longer necessary or relevant.Now, I pay about $60 a month for Cablevision’s broadband service — almost $100 less than I was paying — and I subscribe to Netflix /quotes/zigman/87598/delayed/quotes/nls/nflx NFLX +1.20%  so my kids can watch commercial-free kid shows. I’m also trying Hulu Plus for online access to network TV shows. There’s also online video options for sports fans, like MLB.com, and you can buy all the great TV series a la carte on iTunes if you don’t mind being a little behind the curve — who can stay current on all these shows anyway? I’ve also been pleasantly surprised by Apple TV’s library of free video podcast selections, which are excellent, including some current news shows.Oh, and then I can access the entire Internet on my computer, which has some good stuff on it too — including independent news and commentary sources that often better informed and more accurate than our mainstream, corporate news outlets.I have absolutely nothing against Cablevision or any other cable company and all the great people who work for them. In fact, I’ve seen Cablevision CEO Jim Dolan sing and play guitar in his rock band — he’s surprisingly talented and has excellent taste in music. I just like having options as a consumer.I tried AT&T’s /quotes/zigman/398198/delayed/quotes/nls/t T +0.48%   U-Verse Internet service, which finally made it to my neighborhood, but it was too slow. So, like many Americans, I only have one real choice for quality Internet service, and according to the Federal Communications Commission, we pay more for Internet service than consumers in other developed countries — often substantially more — and in return, we get lower quality service.I don’t know how this situation could sit well with any red-blooded American capitalist, except for one who is benefitting from it handsomely, like Comcast /quotes/zigman/89307/delayed/quotes/nls/cmcsa CMCSA +0.63%   CEO Brian Roberts. He wasn’t kidding when he recently justified Comcast’s impending acquisition of Time Warner Cable /quotes/zigman/528868/delayed/quotes/nls/twc TWC +0.68%   by saying the two companies don’t compete. A handful of cable companies have divided up the country, and their territories don’t overlap — there really is no competition between them.If this sounds like the way a monopoly works, that’s because it is. Therefore, we should have federal regulations — like real net neutrality rules and other consumer protections — imposed on the nation’s Internet service providers in order to promote access and competition, which would help our economy grow and innovate in the digital age.Unfortunately, our federal government appears to be woefully corrupt and dysfunctional to most sensible people of all political leanings, and the telecommunications industry is able to deploy its lobbying strength on Capitol Hill to get basically everything it wants. This has troubling ramifications for our nation’s media future at a time when we’re undergoing a massive transformation in communications technology.If we have limited sway over this situation as voters, though, we do have some leverage that we can wield in the free market as consumers, which is why everyone should consider their options for cutting the cord, saving money, and pressuring the handful of giant companies that control our media and access to the Internet to stop standing in the way of technological progress and move out from behind their old business model to compete for audiences on the new media playing field.Nat Worden is a journalist whose work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Outside Magazine, Newsday, The Village Voice and elsewhere.

Attack of the drones: Invest or run screaming?	By Therese Poletti, MarketWatchAs tech companies and startups tout the good and fabulous things about drones, it’s important to consider all the aspects that these whirring unmanned devices will have on our future.Here’s your world with drones, circa 2024.13 cutting edge drone companies you should knowIf Amazon.com Inc. /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN +1.39%  has its way, you won’t have to worry about running out of baby formula at 2 a.m. Ding-dong. Drone delivery.Lost hiking in Nepal? Throw that pocket drone you packed with the water-purification tablets into the air. It’ll scan the area, give you a location and maybe send an SOS to your pals at home.And when you finally reach camp, chances are you’ll be able to catch up on a few hundred work emails. By then, Google Inc.’s /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.41% Titan Aerospace drones will be high in the atmosphere on solar power, looping in even the remotest goat herder. Or maybe you’ll share a photo of that awesome Himalayan sunrise via a Facebook Inc. /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB -0.24% high-altitude drone.But don’t even think of parking in a handicapped space for five minutes. The meter-maid drone has you ticketed before your feet have hit the pavement. And by all means forget an O.J.-style car chase with the police hot on your tail. Do you even want to imagine what a Robocop drone could do?INTERACTIVE: A field guide to dronesThe U.S. military has been using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) since World War I to conduct all kinds of operations in dangerous territory, including killing opponents. Given what we know now about how closely the National Security Agency has been keeping tabs on U.S. citizens, it’s not much of a stretch to imagine unmanned airborne spy patrols.That would put us in George Orwell territory. No, Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four” didn’t envision drones — just a population under constant surveillance. Remember Winston trudging home past signs warning “BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU” to an apartment that featured an always-on tele-screen listening in, and windows observed by flying police patrols. Orwell’s patrols seemed to be manned, but the idea is the same: Spying eyes were everywhere, and today’s drone technology could make it feasible.Drone lobbyist: They’re devices that do the dirty work (just don’t call them drones)“We are a lot of times assuming that the tool is benign or that everyone’s intentions are benign, but are they?” asked Peter Woolley, a political-science professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey and founder of its PublicMind research institute. “Like all tools, they can be used well and for ill.”Some of the positive aspects are novel. Drones are helping fight forest fires in California. They’re also helping prevent rhinoceros poaching in Kenya. In both cases, they’re doing something it would be costly or dangerous for manned aircraft to perform.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C717FEB2-F8AF-11E3-BFDE-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

New home sales hit highest level in 6 years	By Jeffry Bartash, MarketWatchNew U.S. homes sold at an annual rate of 504,000 last month to mark the sharpest increase since May 2008, the government said Tuesday . Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected the pace of sales to rise to a 440,000 rate from a revised 425,000 in April.The quicker pace of sales in May compared to April reflected the biggest one-month increase in 22 years.The surge was spearheaded by a 54.5% gain in the Northeast, the biggest advance in almost two years. Yet the region typically has the fewest sales in the U.S. and the seasonally adjusted numbers can be particularly volatile. Just a month before in April, for instance, sales in the Northeast were the lowest in nearly two years.Still, demand for new housing also showed renewed strength in the West and South, the regions with the highest number of home sales. Sales shot up 34% in the West and 14.2% in the South. In the Midwest sales rose a scant 1.4%.“The data are highly volatile and the surge in May is clearly exaggerated,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist of High Frequency Economics, but “the housing recovery appears to be getting back on track.”The uptick in sales occurred despite another rise in prices. The median price of a new home advanced 6.9% year-on-year to $282,000. Read more about prices of existing homes.Buyers are always more eager to purchase in the spring months, but an unusually harsh winter may have prompted some people who might have bought a house earlier in the year to wait for warmer weather to arrive.Falling mortgage rates may also be drawing more home shoppers back into the market. A 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 4.19% at the end of May from 4.43% in January, according to giant lender Freddie Mac. Lower rates may have helped boost sales of previously owned homes in May to fastest rate since last fall.The supply of new homes on the U.S. market, meanwhile, dropped to 4.5 months at the current sales pace from 5.3 months in April. The number of homes on sales nationwide was unchanged in May, though home builders have applied for more permits to expand the supply of properties for sale. Economists expect sales to pick up as the year wears on, though not at the same blistering pace as in May.New home sales were 16.9% higher in May compared to one year ago. In April, however, they were 6% lower, showing just how erratic the report on new home sales can be.More from MarketWatchCity-by-city look at home prices, including the surge in BostonBubble or not?

Consumers most confident in more than six years	By Ruth Mantell, MarketWatchAn overall gauge of consumer confidence rose to 85.2 in June — the highest level since January 2008 — from 82.2 in May, the New York-based membership and research group said. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a June reading of 83.5, compared with an original estimate of 83 in May. The gauge equaled 100 in 1985.More respondents in June said that current business condition were “good,” and that the labor market will improve.“The momentum going forward remains quite positive,” said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board.Both the present situation and expectations indexes rose in June. The present-situation gauge rose to 85.1 in June from 80.3 in May, while the expectations barometer rose to 85.2 from 83.5.April data show that home-price growth has turnedSales of new homes rise in May at fastest rate in 6 years	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=297B9182-FBA7-11E3-AE23-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

Forget the iWatch. The truly hip go for the pocket watch	By Charles Passy, MarketWatchThat’s because it is your grandfather’s pocket watch. Or a contemporary homage to it.Yes, the pocket watch — the pre-wristwatch timepiece that has a history going back at least four centuries — is making a major comeback, according to trend spotters and jewelry industry analysts. Retailers and brands, from Walmart to Cartier, are touting pocket watches in a wide range of styles (in 2012, Cartier unveiled a white-gold one that ran more than $650,000). Celebrities and fashion icons — Johnny Depp and Justin Timberlake included — are sporting pocket watches, new or old (hey, there’s nothing that says you can’t wear your grandfather’s watch). And on a related note, a pocket watch owned by James Dean sold for $42,000 at an auction last year.There’s even an effort to give the pocket watch a smartwatch-style relevance: Witness the $169 Kisai Rogue Touch Pocket Watch — true to its name, it’s a pocket watch with touch features and a liquid-crystal display.But whatever the look or style, the pocket watch “is a natural for the marketplace,” says Liz Chatelain of MVI Marketing, a company in San Luis Obispo, Calif., that tracks the jewelry industry.Part of what’s likely driving the trend is the resurgence in watches in general. For a while, it appeared the watch category was dying a slow death, as consumers turned to cellphones, cable boxes and computer screens instead of watches for the time. But with luxury names successfully marketing watches as design showpieces and with other brands promoting watches that can cross the day (work) and night (play) divide, sales have started to climb — up 42% since 2009 to $8.3 billion, according to market researcher Euromonitor International. (Euromonitor doesn’t break out sales for pocket watches, but most researchers who track the watch industry say the pocket watch sub-category has grown from a point of near-extinction to something small but healthy in recent years.)Another key factor to the pocket watch mini boom? Call it retro chic — or more to the point, hipster chic. It’s the hipster crowd’s embrace of all things vintage that has allowed manual typewriters and record players to surface again. Pocket watches are a natural extension of that trend. Plus, pocket watches play into the steampunk movement, a Victorian-minded retro sensibility that’s also gaining ground.Either way, what’s old is new again, says Allen Salkin, a cultural critic who wrote recently about the return of the monocle , another relic poised for a comeback. And as Salkin notes, pocket watches have a certain appeal because they’re not only “a beautiful little piece of technology,” but they’re also one that can be easily grasped by the layperson. “You pop open the back of your iPhone and you won’t see cool little gears working,” he adds.The irony is that today’s owners of pocket watches may be fascinated with all those gears, but they’re not always worried about the watch’s essential function, says Douglas Stuart, owner of PocketWatchRepair.com, a Seattle-based company that specializes in restoring vintage timepieces. Sure, they want to make certain the watch is in good working order, says Stuart, but they really see its value more as a fashion statement than anything else.“I don’t think most people buy them to tell time,” says Stuart.More from MarketWatch:New summer cocktail?

Here’s what we’ll give up for a down payment on a home	By Amy Hoak, MarketWatchIt’s so hard that nearly 60% of couples would be willing to forgo their honeymoon for a down payment, according to a recent ERA Real Estate survey of 1,000 people in committed relationships. And nearly 50% of women said they’d give up a big engagement ring.Another survey of 500 adults, by the real-estate website Trulia, found that 37% of Millennials plan to work a second job to come up with a down payment. Those in the mortgage industry say they’ve heard people selling off their things, from cars to surfboards, to raise the money.For 60% of people between the ages of 18 and 34, their finances are the biggest obstacle to becoming a homeowner, according to Trulia. It’s a reason that first-time buyers have been largely absent from the housing market’s recovery.Years ago, when mortgage underwriting was much less strict and lending programs more lenient, “there was almost no barrier,” said Cyndee Kendall, regional mortgage sales manager and vice president of the Northern California region for Bank of the West.“For years, first-time buyers were in their late 20s and early 30s, and they put as much down as they could to qualify and keep their payments low,” said Julie Reynolds, spokeswoman with LoanDepot. “But LoanDepot is seeing their average age inch up and their down payments shrink. A lot of people want to put 10% down, but can’t.”Below are some top ways first-time home buyers are finding money for their down payments — and what to watch out for when taking these avenues.No one wants to hear they should give up their morning latte to save. But cutting back somewhere in your expenses can be very effective.“The best way is to save for a down payment over time, from your income,” said Karen Carlson, director of education and creative programs for InCharge Education Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on personal finance education. “Here’s how: downgrade your automobile for lower monthly payments, cut out cable television in favor of an online service, sell your stuff, take on temporary short-term work,” she wrote in an email. (She also notes that saving for a down payment is just the beginning; homeowners also should have a robust emergency fund.)Brown bagging it at work could save $10 a day, which, for a couple, comes out to $100 a week or $4,800 a year (52 weeks, minus vacation and holidays off), Reynolds suggested.Here’s the problem: Many millennials have no interest in cutting their little luxuries, according to the Trulia survey. When asked about the items they’d never give up to save for a down payment, 65% said their car, 45% said their smartphone, 20% said their cable, 15% said their Netflix subscription, 14% said their vacations and 13% said dining out.Half of millennials said they’d ask their parents or grandparents for help in coming up with a down payment, according to the Trulia survey. And for many, that can be a good move. But there’s one important caveat: There’s a difference between getting a gift with no strings attached and a loan that is expected to be repaid.“Gift money is always a great option. We always recommend that there is a paper trail for the buyer on any deposits they receive (ask the family member to provide a cashier’s check, etc.),” wrote Phyllis Caldwell, director for the Center for Homeownership in Winston-Salem, N.C., in an email interview. The paper trail is important because mortgage lenders will often want to see documentation of where the money came from. “If they are getting a loan from a family member, keep in mind that this could be considered as debt, and I would caution against this if there is an impact on their debt-to-income ratios,” which will impact mortgage eligibility.Some newlyweds downsize their wedding festivities to save, Kendall said, or they count on cash gifts from wedding guests to add to their savings.Help can also come from state and local programs for homeowners. For instance, in Illinois, the Welcome Home Illinois program provides borrowers with $7,500 in down-payment assistance and a below-market mortgage interest rate.Taking a 401(k) loan is another way of funding your down payment. About 15% of the time, buyers take a loan from their 401(k)s; it’s more common among first-time buyers, Kendall said.But many financial experts suggest proceeding with caution.“You can take a loan out to buy a house, but you can’t take a loan out for retirement,” said Jeanne Thompson, vice president of Fidelity Investments.With a 401(k) loan, you’re liquidating assets from your 401(k), and the money gets paid back automatically through your pay check over time, Thompson said. There are limits on how much you can borrow. But if the money isn’t paid back by the time you leave your job, you’re going to have to pay the loan back immediately — or be taxed on the outstanding balance, she added.But perhaps the biggest problem with taking out one of these loans is that while paying it back, it will likely be difficult for you to save as much as you would have otherwise, Thompson said. And you could miss out on market growth while the money is missing from your account.“People may feel like if they have $50,000, taking out $10,000 isn’t that much,” Thompson said. “But especially when they’re young, the potential for that to grow is significant.”Perhaps getting a 20% down payment seems impossible. But what about 10% or 3.5%? By considering all your loan options, you may be able to lower your down-payment requirement.Bank of the West offers an 80-10-10 or “piggyback” option, meaning you’ll have a first mortgage for 80% of your home value, a second mortgage in the form of a home-equity line or loan for 10% of the value, and a 10% down payment. While these loans were very popular before the housing crash, it won’t be very easy to find them in the marketplace today, Kendall said. “We’re one of the few banks that didn’t stop doing them,” she added. Often lenders will, however, let those who qualify put down less than 20%, on the condition that they pay for private mortgage insurance.Loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs allow smaller down payments. But in the case of FHA mortgages, a 3.5% down payment comes at a price: You’ll pay monthly mortgage insurance, through the life of the loan, Kendall noted.Also on MarketWatch:Apartment rents are slowing, finallyWhy Millennials are hurting the real-estate recoveryWhy the higher cost of a new house may be worth it	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=DA077F7A-FB93-11E3-AE23-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

Sales of new homes rise in May at fastest rate in 6 years	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - New U.S. homes sold at an annual rate of 504,000 in May to mark the highest level in six years, the government said Tuesday. Yet the surprising gain - economists polled by MarketWatch expected a 440,000 increase - was led by a huge surge in the Northeast. The region typically has the fewest sales in the U.S. and the seasonally adjusted numbers can be particularly volatile. Just a month before in April, for instance, sales in the Northeast were the smallest in almost two years. Meanwhile, sales climbed 34% in the West and 14.2% in the South. A bounceback after a winter-induced lull may have boosted sales in the warmer spring months Sales rose just 1.4% in the Midwest, however. The median price of new homes rose 4.6% to $282,000 last month. The supply of new homes on the U.S. market dropped to 4.5 months at the current sales pace from 5.3 months in April. New home sales were 16.9% higher in May compared to one year ago. In April, however, they were 6% lower, showing how erratic the report on new home sales can be.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=FC6531E0-08E3-4804-8319-61E960101BCB&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24
U.S. home prices rise 1.1% in April	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- U.S. home prices rose 1.1% in April, a second monthly gain as the spring selling season got underway, according to S&P/Case-Shillers 20-city composite index released Tuesday. Among 20 tracked cities, all saw higher home prices in April. After seasonal adjustments, home prices among the 20 cities rose 0.2% in April, compared with growth of 1.2% in March. Meanwhile, annual growth posted a sharp slowdown, with year-over-year home prices rising 10.8% in April - the slowest pace since March 2013 - compared with annual growth of 12.4% in March 2014. Among the 20 cities, 19 saw annual growth taper in April, including hot California markets. Including Aprils monthly gain, prices were about 18% below a 2006 peak.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C4EAAAF7-6CDF-46EC-BE53-1C89D28237F1&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

Does Facebook break up marriages?	By Quentin Fottrell, MarketWatchA growing body of research links increased use of Facebook /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB -3.88%   to marital discord. The latest of these studies, published in the July 2014 issue of the journal “ Computers in Human Behavior ,” says increased use of Facebook is “positively correlated” with rising divorce rates during the same time period even when adjusting for economic and socio-demographic factors that might affect divorce rates. “Although it may seem surprising that a Facebook profile, a relatively small factor compared with other drivers of human behavior, could have a significant statistical relationship with divorce rates and marital satisfaction, it nonetheless seems to be the case,” the study concluded.A 20% annual increase in the share of a state’s population with a Facebook account from 2008 to 2010 was associated with a 2.2% increase in that state’s divorce rate. To reach that conclusion, researchers cross-referenced divorce rates in 43 U.S. states from the National Center for Health Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey with the number of Facebook accounts opened in those states. The study suggests a correlation, however, and not causation. “We don’t know whether Facebook is causing divorce or divorce is causing the use of Facebook,” says Sebastián Valenzuela, co-author of the study and assistant professor in the School of Communications at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.Previous studies also support the conclusion that there’s a connection between social networking and marital problems. Adjusting for other variables, 32% of heavy social-media users say they’ve thought seriously about leaving their spouses, compared with 16% of people who don’t use social networks, according to a 2011 University of Texas at Austin survey of 1,600 married 18- to 39-year-olds. This is one of the few — if not only — publicly available representative surveys in the U.S. that contains questions about both social-network use and indicators of marriage well-being, Valenzuela adds. One-third of divorce filings in the U.K. contain the word Facebook, a separate 2011 survey by Divorce Online, a legal services website, found. (A Facebook spokesman says it’s “ludicrous” to suggest a link between the social network site and divorce.)Also read: The best (and worst) time to get a divorceOne theory: Extramarital affairs might have taken months or even years to develop in the past, but with Facebook, Snapchat and other social networks your ex-boyfriend or girlfriend is just a click away, says New York-based divorce financial strategist Jeff Landers, author of “ Divorce: Think Financially, Not Emotionally .” When marriages go through rocky patches and people do seek support, temptation has never been closer, he adds. “You can easily reconnect with an old boyfriend or girlfriend from college online,” Landers says. “It all starts innocently enough, but the next thing you know you are meeting for coffee and the next thing you know you’re having an affair.”Even the most mundane stories on social media provide an escape, says Abby Rodman, a psychotherapist in Boston, and people who bury their head in a computer screen risk paying less attention to the problems in their relationships. “If you are glued to a computer screen, you’re not looking into your partner’s eyes,” she says. “Instead of reading what’s going on with your partner, you’re reading about someone’s dog’s surgery on Facebook. It’s a clear message to your partner that you’re more interested in what’s going on elsewhere rather than what’s in front of you.” Being in a relationship takes work, she adds, but spending your time communicating with others via social media — including your spouse — is “relationship lite.”It’s hard to know what comes first: Divorce or obsessing about the lives of others on Facebook. One thing is certain: Facebook is useful after a marriage breaks down. Over 80% of divorce attorneys have seen a rise in cases using social networking, according to the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. But Michael Stutman, New York state chapter president of AAML and partner at the law firm Mishcon de Reya in New York, says Facebook pops up so often because more people use it. The site is usually cited in divorce cases during child custody disputes, and the search for assets and income, he adds. “These communications are most useful when the people believe nobody else is listening,” Stutman saysOther articles by Quentin Fottrell:Lonely people share too much on FacebookWhy Facebook is toying with your emotions10 things dating sites won’t tell you	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C4C436D4-0611-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
This M&A boom is going to end badly	By Mark Hulbert, MarketWatchCHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — Those wondering what to make of the recent M&A boom would do well to focus on how Barnes & Noble’s /quotes/zigman/132169/delayed/quotes/nls/bks BKS -2.59%  stock reacted to its late-June announcement that it would soon be splitting into two separate companies.Splitting up is just the opposite of merging, of course. And, yet, the company’s stock promptly jumped on that news, and today is more than 12% higher than it was two weeks ago.Was that just a fluke? It’s a crucial question for investors: If splitting up creates value, might mergers and acquisitions be destroying value?“Yes” is the answer of a large body of academic research over the years. Much of that research relies on a valuation measure known as the Q Ratio, which was introduced by the late James Tobin, the Yale University finance professor and 1981 Nobel laureate in economics. A firm’s Q Ratio is calculated by dividing its total market cap by the replacement value of its total assets.More diversified companies, researchers have found, have on average lower Q ratios than firms that are more focused on one business purpose. This tendency has become known as the “diversification discount.”How big is this discount? One fascinating answer comes from a 2012 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The study’s authors focused on firms that were the losers in bidding contests to acquire another company. They found that the stocks of these “losers” did 50% percent better over the three years following the merger than the stocks of the companies that won those bidding contexts.No wonder that the study’s authors titled their study “Winning by Losing.”Barnes & Noble is the exception these days, as more companies are deciding to do the opposite. In fact, according to data from Dealogic, M&A deals this year are running at their highest pace since 2007.That is an ominous parallel, of course, since that year marked the top of the bull market prior to the Great Recession. But the parallels are even more worrisome than that, according to Matthew Rhodes-Kropf, a Harvard finance professor, who pointed out that “each of the last five great merger waves on record ended with a precipitous decline in equity prices.”This doesn’t necessarily mean that such a decline is imminent. The current M&A wave might still have further to go before the bull market ends.But it can’t be good news for the overall market that so many companies are eager to engage in an activity that historically has done more harm than good.Stock-market bulls should take note.Click here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Sentiment Indexes.More from MarketWatch:Why trading volume is tumbling, explained in 5 chartsHow to buy momentum stocks without getting burnedTSA tightens security for cellphones on U.S.-bound flights	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=1D6906E8-05E5-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

April data show that home-price growth has turned	By Ruth Mantell, MarketWatchS&P/Case-Shiller’s price barometer tracking 20 cities showed that year-over-year price growth hit 10.8% in April — a fast pace but down sharply from annual growth of 12.4% in March and a recent peak of 13.7% in November.“House-price inflation is easing to more sustainable levels,” Andrew Grantham, an economist at CIBC World Markets, wrote in a research note.Limited inventories have been exerting upward pressure on prices over the past year. But a tough winter, as well as recent inventory expansions and dropping affordability, are all putting a damper on California’s ultra-hot markets and elsewhere. Among the 20 cities, 19 saw annual growth taper in April.Although homeowners don’t love slowing appreciation, cooler price growth may encourage more buyers to enter the market. Looking forward, economists expect home prices to continue to slow down as inventories expand. A report on Monday showed that the number of existing homes on the market rose last month to the highest level in almost two years.Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. strategist at TD Securities, expects home-price growth to slow to a range of 6% to 8% by the end of 2014. Despite such as drop, owners would still be gaining equity, supporting the greater economy.“A more gradual pace of home price appreciation should continue to lift more homeowners out of negative equity, albeit at a slightly slower pace,” Goldberg wrote.While the housing market needs more work, there has been some definite improvement in recent quarters as home prices rose. More than 3.5 million homes regained equity over the past year, helping to narrow the number of underwater properties by almost half since late 2009.Also Tuesday, Case-Shiller reported that its monthly gauge of home prices rose 1.1% in April, a second consecutive gain as the spring selling season got underway, with all 20 tracked cities posting higher prices. After seasonal adjustments, home prices among the 20 cities rose 0.2% in April, compared with 1.2% in March.Elsewhere Tuesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which tracks deals involving mortgages backed by Fannie Mae /quotes/zigman/226360/delayed/quotes/nls/fnma FNMA +0.25%  and Freddie Mac /quotes/zigman/226335/delayed/quotes/nls/fmcc FMCC +0.77% , reported that home prices were unchanged in April , while annual growth hit 5.9%.Looking broadly at the housing market, a weak first quarter is likely to ding the annual sales tally for 2014, dragging it below last year’s result. Economists are concerned that the market remains slow, and had expected low interest rates to spur demand. On Monday, a senior Treasury official said that the U.S. needs to see housing and construction bounce back more for the country to break through to the next level of the recovery.Should you move to Detroit?The housing market: Owning versus renting	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CEAE94E0-FB9A-11E3-AE23-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24
LeBron James opts out of contract: ESPN	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) Miami Heat star Lebron James has opted to terminate his contract early and become an NBA free agent, his agent told ESPN Tuesday. Rumors about Jamess next move abound. Sports Illustrated speculates that he will sign with the Los Angeles Clippers, while another story on ESPN quotes sources saying he is exiting his contract so the Heat can sign New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony, and that James will eventually sign a new deal with the team. James had until June 29 to make the decision to opt out of his contract. He was scheduled to make $20 million next season. His decision comes in the wake of the Heats loss to the San Antonio Spurs in Game 5 of the NBA finals earlier this month.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CD8CDFCB-C440-4719-B501-DF343F429606&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

Carnival beats profit, revenue estimates	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Cruise operator Carnival Corp. /quotes/zigman/322132/delayed/quotes/nls/ccl CCL +0.83% said it earned $106 million, or 14 cents a share, in its fiscal second quarter, up from $41 million, or 5 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 10 cents a share, up from 7 cents a year ago. Revenue totaled $3.633 billion, up from $3.479 billion. The FactSet consensus was for earnings of 2 cents a share and revenue of $3.603 billion. We benefited from effective marketing initiatives, which combined with a gradually improving economic environment, led to revenue yield improvement for our continental European brands in the quarter compared to the prior year and is expected to continue through the remainder of the year, Chief Executive Arnold Donald said in a statement. The company is now expecting revenues for all of 2014 to be higher, while net revenue yields will fall slightly and net cruise costs excluding fuel will be flat to slightly higher. The company raised its full-year outlook to adjusted per-share earnings of $1.60 to $1.75, up from $1.58 a share in 2013. Shares fell 2.6% in early trade.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E07D231C-122A-4450-9101-42268446D85B&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

In April, the annual rate of new single-family home sales rose 6.4% to 433,000.The new round of housing data arrives a day after the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes in May hit the fastest pace in seven months.While the report was a “welcomed” result, sales have only modestly improved from the lows in activity at the start of the year, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Sterne Agee. “Going forward, rising home prices will continue to exclude many potential home-buyers from entering the market, against the backdrop of lackluster income growth and still-tepid full-time, high-wage job creation. Warmer weather alone is not enough to restore housing market activity,” Piegza said late Monday.A gauge of consumer confidence will arrive at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, and economists polled by MarketWatch expect the Conference Board’s survey to edge up to 83.5 in June, from 83 in May. Also due at 10 a.m. Eastern Time is the Richmond Fed’s manufacturing index for June.Investors will watch for comments from several Fed officials.Speaking in New York on Tuesday morning, Charles Plosser, the president of the Philadelphia Fed said that several variations of a well-known monetary policy rule uniformly call for the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates in the third quarter of 2014, well before the market now expects the central bank to move.Plosser, a voting member of the Fed’s rate-setting committee, “is considered hawkish, and the risk is that he will put more focus on the recent higher core inflation, even though the Fed continued its dovish tone last week,” said analysts at Danske Bank in a Tuesday note.Also on the Fed speakers docket, New York Fed President William Dudley will address an accountants’ group in San Juan, Puerto Rico about the Puerto Rican economy at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Dudley gets a vote at every Federal Open Market Committee meeting and is vice chairman of the interest-rate setting committee.After the market closes, San Francisco Fed President John Williams will appear on a panel about the global economy, the U.S. budget and the Fed at Stanford Law School at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Williams, who’s not a voting member this year on the Fed policy committee, last month said easy monetary policy will likely be in place longer than expected because of the “halting and relatively gradual” recovery in the U.S. economy.At 2 p.m. Eastern Time, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will testify before a House committee on a report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council.Turning to corporate developments, Monsanto Co. /quotes/zigman/267799/delayed/quotes/nls/mon MON -0.0079%  may grab attention during the regular trading session following a Bloomberg report that the seed giant held preliminary talks with Swiss rival Syngenta AG /quotes/zigman/270167/delayed/quotes/nls/syt SYT +0.24%   /quotes/zigman/263744/delayed CH:SYNN +0.24%  about a $40 billion takeover.

Here’s what you’ll save by ditching cable TV	By Quentin FottrellBut is cutting the cord right for you? To help answer that question we’ve created a new interactive cord-cutting calculator .Here’s how it works: Answer a few questions about your TV watching needs, including your favorite shows and sports leagues, and the tool will crunch the numbers and give you several options to best approximate your cable TV experience.Do you want to see live programming, new shows the day they premiere, and premium channels such as HBO and Showtime? In that case, don’t cut the cord. But if you’re willing to part with some live TV, it’s worth reviewing your options. The calculator matches the offerings of streaming services like Hulu Plus and Netflix /quotes/zigman/87598/delayed/quotes/nls/nflx NFLX +1.20% — as well as the various sports league packages — to your current viewing habits.This is a critical time for the cable industry, which recently had its worst year ever . As Internet streaming services improve, more Americans are deciding what’s lost by abandoning traditional cable. Cable bills have more than doubled over the last decade and the national average bill — currently hovering at $90 a month — will reach $200 in 2020, estimates market researcher The NPD Group. What’s more, over 80% of consumers already say their cable bills are too high, according to another survey by deal aggregator TechBargains.com. Increasingly, people watch shows illegally. “Cutting the cord for most people is easier said than done unless they go pirate,” says Craig Moffett, senior analyst at Moffett Nathanson Research. (The CBS sitcom “How I Met Your Mother” has over 16 million views on one pirate site.)NEW: MarketWatch’s interactive cord-cutting calculatorOf course, television networks are painfully aware that people are watching their TV shows illegally. The three big broadcast networks — NBC, ABC and CBS — have tablet/smartphone apps and websites that allow viewers to access their shows — with advertisements. (Time delays vary, depending on the show and the network: CBS usually streams shows a day later, while NBC and ABC stream them the same day.) Carl Gray, a doctor in Morgantown, West Virginia, and his fiancée Abby Freeland, are getting married in October 2014 and have already decided to cut the cord on their $186-a-month Comcast cable subscription and rely exclusively on Netflix, Hulu, iTunes and the networks’ apps instead. “We’re going to save the money for a band for our wedding,” Gray says.Charging consumers more hasn’t resulted in major losses for the cable industry — yet. “Napster was a gun to the head of the entire music business,” Moffett says. “That hasn’t happened with cable.” Nevertheless, 2013 was the pay TV industry’s worst year, he says. Cable operators lost 687,000 subscribers in the third quarter and added 574,000 subscribers, resulting in a net loss of 113,000. Another problem for cable companies: A sluggish housing market and uncertain economic climate have also meant that there are two million “missing households” — Americans who would be owning or renting a home now if prerecession economic trends had continued, Moffett says. “They either cut the cord or never signed up,” he says.Also see:	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=EB6688AA-61CF-11E3-8B12-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

Yahoo CEO Mayer oversleeps ad event at Cannes	By Suzanne VranicaLast Tuesday evening, Interpublic Group of Cos. /quotes/zigman/230324/delayed/quotes/nls/ipg IPG +0.05% arranged a dinner at the swanky French Riviera restaurant L’Oasis for Mayer to meet executives from marketers such as Mondelez International Inc. /quotes/zigman/11829567/delayed/quotes/nls/mdlz MDLZ +0.16% , brewer MillerCoors LLC /quotes/zigman/244740/delayed UK:SAB +0.18%  and Greek-yogurt maker Chobani Inc.It was supposed to be a chance for Interpublic and some of its clients to get a firsthand update from Mayer on what Yahoo /quotes/zigman/59898/delayed/quotes/nls/yhoo YHOO +0.72% had to offer.But Mayer was nearly two hours late, and several dinner attendees, including IPG Chief Executive Michael Roth, ended up leaving before she arrived, according to people familiar with the matter.Mayer told some attendees that she had fallen asleep, some of the people said. She told one of the attendees that she had been up for 20 hours.Tuesday was the day Mayer gave a big presentation on the main stage at Cannes, talking about Yahoo’s ad offerings, specifically highlighting Tumblr, a Yahoo-owned blogging site.Roughly 30 people attended the dinner, the people said, a small group by Cannes ad festival standards. Among them were several senior Yahoo executives, including the company’s Americas head, Ned Brody, and its marketing chief, Kathy Savitt. But Mayer was the main attraction, and the meal was held while the group waited for her, according to one of the people.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E9742EF4-FB98-11E3-8AA5-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-24

Weakened Hurricane Arthur heads toward Nova Scotia	By Karishma Mehrota, Laura Stevens and Valerie BauerleinArthur weakened quickly to a Category 1 hurricane, with 90 mile-per-hour winds, after making landfall Thursday night as a Category 2 storm on the southern end of the Outer Banks. It was downgraded further to a posttropical cyclone Saturday as it headed toward Nova Scotia..By late Friday, the heaviest rain was starting to taper off, although tropical-storm warnings remained in effect for parts of Massachusetts. Coastal Rhode Island, Eastern Massachusetts, and Cape Cod and its surrounding islands took much of the punch from the holiday storm. Nantucket recorded wind gusts of 63 miles an hour, and opened a shelter at the local high school to house visitors who were stranded when ferries leaving the upscale vacation colony were canceled.South of Boston, the fishing community of New Bedford took in 8 inches of rain that caused significant flash flooding and sent cars floating along streets, said meteorologist Bill Simpson, with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass. The utility National Grid said more than 3,500 customers were without power.The center of the storm was expected to travel near or over Nova Scotia on Saturday, weakening further.“We expect the storm to lose its tropical characteristic tonight or tomorrow and become a post tropical cyclone,” said National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen. He said the storm wouldn’t have “the structure of a hurricane anymore.”Despite its weakening, Fourth of July barbecue and fireworks plans were still a washout for residents and vacationers along the coast, with the heaviest rains Friday in the mid-Atlantic and New England. Providence, R.I., Manchester, N.H., and Portland, Maine were among many cities that moved fireworks to Saturday.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8A9A8B60-0469-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-05

Why silver is outperforming gold and isn’t done yet	By Myra P. Saefong, MarketWatch“The real value of silver is far from being realized,” said Andrew Chanin, chief executive officer of PureFunds, which offers the PureFunds ISE Junior Silver ETF /quotes/zigman/12969965/delayed/quotes/nls/silj SILJ -0.52% .Tracking the most-active futures contracts, silver prices /quotes/zigman/698627/delayed SIN4 +0.34% /quotes/zigman/12294966/delayed SIU4 +0.30% have gained roughly 13% month to date, compared with gold’s /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.05%  6% climb.Silver is priced as if it’s much more common than gold, but it may be much rarer than the price suggests, Chanin said. Given its antibacterial properties and ability to conduct heat and electricity, silver may also become even more important as an industrial metal, “causing a supply shortage.”Out of 19 trading sessions this month, silver prices have fallen only three times, while gold prices posted declines for five of them. And while gold prices traded recently at just over a two-month high, silver tapped its highest in more than three months.Year to date, gold has still outperformed but barely — up 10% versus silver’s 9% climb.Analysts attribute silver’s recent gains to some safe-haven demand on the heels of the turmoil in Iraq. But they also said improving economic data helped raise the demand outlook for the metal.Most of the upward move for silver was due to the increase in demand and this was fueled by improving economic data, which hit the tape early this week and last week in the U.S., said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade.HSBC’s preliminary read on the Chinese manufacturing sector for May hit a seven-month high. In the U.S., May industrial production climbed more than expected and an index of manufacturing conditions in the Philadelphia region rose to the highest reading since last September.But on Wednesday, data showed that the U.S. economy contracted by 2.9% in the first quarter. Weekly data Thursday showed that jobless claims remain near a post-recession low and consumer spending in May rose less than expected.Aslam said that with major resistance for silver around the $22 mark and the metal’s recent run, a “small correction” may be in the cards.But longer term, “silver may continue to outperform as it does not serve the exact purpose as gold” which can be seen as a risk-off trade and inflation hedge, he said. And silver can “continue moving up if the growth starts picking up and the general public finds more appetite for jewelry.”“Cheap” and “undervalued” are some of the words analysts used to reference silver when asked for their take on the outlook for the metal.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E200EC70-FD41-11E3-B93C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27

Surge in cancer in Beijing raises worries over pollution	By Laura He, MarketWatchSome 40,307 new cases of cancer were reported in China’s capital in 2012, according to statistics from Beijing’s city government released Thursday. That works out at about 110 people a day being diagnosed with cancer.The number has almost doubled from 10 years ago, which saw 63 new diagnoses a day on average, according to an official at Beijing’s Cancer Research and Control Office.Among men, lung cancer was the most diagnosed cancer, followed by colorectal cancer and liver cancer. Among women, the top three were breast cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer.Although the government blamed “unhealthy life habits” for the surge, some commentators on Chinese social media begged to differ.“Air pollution, abuse of food additives — how can we not be getting disease?” read a post on Weibo by an official account for the Beijing Yidaxinkai Technology Co.“About 20% of lung cancer cases are related to PM 2.5 air pollution [fine particulate matters that can penetrate into the lung]. Many people got it despite never smoking,” a Beijing resident with the handle “Laoxushiping” said on his Weibo account. “Where can we escape?”More must-reads from MarketWatch:Asia Stocks blog: Japan has a date with dataOil futures ease, with Brent around $113 a barrel5 (more) cheap stocks in the energy sector	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=348E18FA-FDC4-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-27
Asia Stocks live blog: Japan has a date with data	Welcome to the Asia Stocks live blog, a running account of what the region’s share markets are doing, along with other news. Data feature high today, as Japan unloads a pile of numbers and China reports industrial profit.Aside from shockingly weak consumer spending as the shadow of the consumption-tax hike still looms, the first batch of Japanese data out this morning has little in the way of surprises.Spending by households of two of more people plunged by a price-adjusted 8% in May compared to a year earlier, even sharper than April’s 4.6% fall, and confounding expectations for moderation to a 2% decrease, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of economists.Hosing expenditure led the retreat in spending, tumbling more than 25%, followed by the “furniture & household utensils” category.As for the other numbers, Japan’s May core consumer price index (which omits fresh-food prices, seen as too volatile for the data set) was up 3.4% from a year earlier, identical to the consensus projection in the Wall Street Journal poll and just a bit above a revised 3.2% gain in April.It was the same story for the June month-to-date result for metropolitan Tokyo, a leading indicator for the national trend, which rose 2.8% — again, matching the analysts’ consensus, as well as the previous month’s read.That both these rates remains above the 2% central-bank target should be a good thing, and as Reuters noted, it was the higher core inflation result since April 1982. But as a Dow Jones Newswires report notes, the core price gain was only 1.4% if the effects of the consumption tax are stripped out.Rounding out the party was the unemployment rate, which eased to 3.5% from April’s 3.6%. Economists had expected no change from last month.In any case, the market reaction to the results was … crickets. The yen is unchanged from its pre-data level, with the dollar buying ¥101.65.Meanwhile, May retail sales are due out shortly.[NOTE: This post is updated to correct for a revision to the April core CPI, which was up 3.2% from a year earlier]While data out 20 minutes earlier showed a sharp fall for consumer spending, the situation last month doesn’t appear to have been so dire for the retailers.May retail sales data show a drop of just 0.4%, easing off of a revised 4.3% pullback in April as the consumption-tax hike arrived, and trouncing an average forecast for a 1.8% decrease, according to a Reuters survey.The large-scale retailers had a slightly rougher time, their sales retreating 1.2% on a same-store basis, though still a significant improvement from April’s revised 6.7% fall.As with the earlier statistics, the yen is unmoved (still at ¥101.65) and Singapore-traded Nikkei Average futures are quoted down 0.2%, just as they were ahead of the numbers. As the week winds down, we find the Nikkei Average wading into shallow losses, as investors trade off of mixed domestic data, a slim overnight pullback on Wall Street and a slightly stronger Japanese yen.The benchmark is currently down 0.1%, with the broader Topix flat, as the dollar buys ¥101.61 yen compared to ¥101.83 about 24 hours earlier.Some of the techs and industrials are fronting the weakness, with Renesas down 3.6%, Tokyo Electron down 1.4%, Kawasaki Heavy down 1.8%, and Sony off 1% after its Sony Pictures Television unit announced the purchase of U.K. cable-and-satellite network CSC Media.But there’s upside in these sectors too, with TDK, Hitachi and Nidec all 0.5% higher, and Toshiba up 0.6% to extend its gains earlier this week after ditching plans to buy the power-grid business of France’s Alstom from acquirer General Electric.Konica Minolta is flat, getting little in the way of help from a Nikkei business daily report that the company will post a 50% jump in its April-June operating profit.Auto stocks are mixed, with Toyota up 0.1%, Nissan down 0.4%, Honda down 0.1%, and Mitsubishi Motors up 0.3% as a separate Nikkei report says the company will soon start building sedans for Fiat Chrysler to sell in Asian markets.And a less-than-expected pullback in May retail sales has left the sector’s shares mixed as well, with J. Front up 0.7%, Fast Retailing down 0.5%, Takashimaya up 0.2%, and Aeon down 0.2%.Tokyo (Nikkei Average) down 0.3%Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) up 0.2%Seoul (Kospi) down 0.3%While Tokyo and Seoul trend lower in early trading, Sydney is moving higher, with the ASX 200 up 0.2% on gains for commodity prices.Of particular help for the Australian mining sector this morning is a sharp gain for iron-ore prices, currently sitting around $95.30 per metric ton. The resulting advance for the iron miners varies, with Fortescue Metals up 2.7%, BC Iron up 0.9% and Atlas Iron up 0.3% (though Mount Gibson Iron is down 2.4%, pulling back from recent gains).As for the diversified senior miners, BHP Billiton is up 0.2%, and rival Rio Tinto is up 0.6%.The standout gainer is Paladin Energy, rising 3.4% after providing an upbeat update on its Michelin uranium deposit in Canada’s Labrador region.Of course it’s not all smiles and handshakes for the mining shares, with Kingsgate down 1.1%, St. Barbara down 2.5% and Sydney-listed shares of Canada’s Alacer losing 2.6%, after Comex gold futures snapped their win streak overnight in New York.In the airline space, meanwhile, shares of both Qantas and Virgin Australia are unchanged as Sydney Airport suffers a power outage at its T2 domestic terminal, disrupting flights. All the same, shares of Sydney Airport itself are up 0.1%.Tokyo (Nikkei Average) down 0.3%Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) flatShanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) down 0.5%Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) flatSeoul (Kospi) down 0.1%Taipei (Taiex) down 0.1%Hong Kong stocks are trying to stay above the water after scoring a solid 1.5% gain the previous day, with the Hang Seng Index trading flat at the start of Friday trading. Over on the Chinese mainland, however, Shanghai stocks are pulling back from their weekly high hit in Thursday’s session, with the Shanghai Composite Index retreating 0.5%.Casino stocks are extending their recent gains, as investors appear relieved after Macau reportedly clarified that it only told casinos to stop adding new UnionPay card terminals, rather than requiring gaming houses to remove all terminals, as originally reported. Previous media accounts had the city’s authority ordering all jewelry stores and pawn shops within casinos to remove UnionPay payment card terminals, so as to curb illegal-money transfers from the mainland to one of the world’s largest gambling hubs. Among the sector’s top gainers, Melco Crown Entertainment is climbing 1.6%, and MGM China Holdings is rising 1.2%.Banks are mixed. While BOC Hong Kong is rising 0.7%, and Bank of China is adding 0.3%, while Agricultral Bank of China and China Construction Bank Corp. are falling 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.Shares of Standard Chartered are down 3.8%, though off their opening lows, after the bank issued a profit warning.Chinese data are out on overall earnings at the nation’s largest industrial corporations, with growth still strong but slowing.For May, profit was up 8.9% from a year earlier, a robust pace but still 0.7 of a point below what it was in April.More importantly, the gains are lagging what major Chinese enterprises saw last year. Much of the profit data are reported on a cumulative basis, and on those terms, the January-May profit growth was 9.8%, marking the only time the number has fallen below 10% in the past 12 months, with the exception of this year’s January-February Lunar New Year period — always a slow time — when the expansion rate cooled to 9.4%.The fact that industrial profit rose 12.2% last year underlines the slowdown now facing Chinese companies.Then again, not all types of enterprise are equal: Private companies managed a 12.9% profit gain, foreign-funded companies (including, for the data’s purposes, those from Hong Kong and Macau) saw their earnings rise 12.4%, but the state-owned corporations saw profit improve by a slim 3.4%.Tokyo (Nikkei Average) down 0.6% (at break)Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) down 0.1%Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) down 0.4%Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) down 0.1%Seoul (Kospi) down 0.2%Taipei (Taiex) down 0.1%The Nikkei Average’s 0.1% opening loss has seen its decimal point move one spot to the right, with the Japanese stock benchmark now down 1.7% for the day.The reason? ‘Twas the yen that dunnit — the dollar, which was at ¥101.61 at the open, is now at ¥101.35 and falling, slamming equities.Among the deeper divers, Renesas is down 4.3%, Fujitsu is down 3%, Kawasaki Heavy is down 3.1%, Bridgestone is down 2.8%, and, well, the list goes on.As for the dollar/yen’s decisive move south, Dow Jones quoted an unidentified Japanese bank dealer as citing stop-loss selling after the pair fell below Thursday’s low of ¥101.49 on speculative dollar sales, though that same dealer sees firm support around ¥101.30, where bids are waiting to buy the greenback.In any case, we haven’t seen a yen this strong since May 21, when the dollar briefly dipped below ¥101, according to FactSet.Tokyo (Nikkei Average) down 1.6%Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) down 0.2% (at break)Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) down 0.4% (at break)Sydney (S&P/ASX 200) down 0.2%Seoul (Kospi) down 0.3%Mumbai (Sensex) up 0.5%Taipei (Taiex) down 0.1%Here’s a look at some of next week’s important events in Asia:Monday: Japan May industrial productionTuesday: Japan Q2 tankan, China government & HSBC PMIs, Reserve Bank of Australia policy decision, Hong Kong closed for holidayWednesday: Australia May trade dataTokyo (Nikkei Average) down 1.6%Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) down 0.1%Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) flatSydney (S&P/ASX 200) down 0.4%Seoul (Kospi) down 0.2%Mumbai (Sensex) up 0.5%Taipei (Taiex) flatA worrying surge in cancer cases in Beijing is grabbing public attention today, with many on social media blaming the city’s increasingly worse pollution.According to statistics from the Beijing city government Thursday, there were about 40,307 new cases of cancer reported in China’s capital in 2012. That means, every day about 110 people were diagnosed with cancer.The number has almost doubled from 10 years ago, when 63 new cases of cancer were diagnosed each day on average, according to an official at the Beijing city government’s Cancer Research and Control Office.Among the most commonly diagnosed cancers in men, lung cancer ranked the first, followed by colorectal cancer and liver cancer. In women, the top three were breast cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer.Although the government pointed to “unhealthy life habits” as the main reason behind the surge, some on Chinese social media begged to differ.“Air pollution, abuse of food additives — how can we not be getting disease?” an official account for the Beijing Yidaxinkai Technology Company said on Weibo.“About 20% of lung cancer cases are related to PM 2.5 air pollution [fine particulate matters that can penetrate into the lung].

U.S stocks trim losses after late-day rally	By Anora Mahmudova, MarketWatchA selloff in the morning after St. Louis Fed president James Bullard’s rate-hike comments sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 119 points at session lows.Bullard said that inflation may hit its 2% target and unemployment may fall below 6% level by the year-end, well before the Fed’s 2015 estimates.The S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.55%  closed off 2.31 points, or 0.1%, at 1,957.22.

Even as the Fed says the rates will stay low, the tapering is essentially a rate hike,” Creatura said.Thursday economic data were generally weaker than expected. The number of people who applied for U.S. unemployment benefits fell slightly last week and remained near a postrecession low, indicating that the nation’s low pace of layoffs and an upturn in hiring are likely to continue.Separately, consumers splurged on new cars and trucks in May, but not much else despite another solid month of income gains.Are drones illegal in your state?

Updates, advisories and surprises	By MarketWatchDuPont cuts earnings outlook, citing corn-seed sales(4:15 PM ET) WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Chemicals giant DuPont /quotes/zigman/225806/delayed/quotes/nls/dd DD +0.67% cut its second-quarter and 2014 profit outlook, citing a worse-than-expected performance in its agriculture arm and also its performance chemicals line. DuPont cited lower-than-expected corn seed sales, higher-than-expected corn seed inventory write-downs, lower-than-expected crop protection herbicide sales, and lower-than-expected selling prices in refrigerants for mobile and stationary applications, which offset better-than-expected soybean sales volumes. It now sees second-quarter operating earnings below last years $1.28 a share, and sees 2014 earnings per share between $4 and $4.10 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected second-quarter earnings of $1.46 a share and 2014 earnings of $4.28 a share. DuPont traded lower in the after-hours session on the news.ConAgra fourth-quarter revenue beats expectations(7:55 AM ET) NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- ConAgra Foods Inc. /quotes/zigman/222950/delayed/quotes/nls/cag CAG +1.80% said Thursday it swung to a loss of $324.2 million, or 77 cents a share, in the fiscal fourth quarter from a year-earlier profit of $192.2 million, or 46 cents a share.

Analysts polled by FactSet had expected per-share earnings of 58 cents on sales of $4.42 billion. We are disappointed with fiscal 2014 overall, and we have a very focused sense of urgency directed toward improving our results, said Gary Rodkin, ConAgra Foods chief executive. ConAgra said it plans to continue its $1 a share annual dividend and expects to reduce debt by about $1 billion in fiscal 2015. The food company said it expects per-share earnings to grow at a mid-single digit rate in fiscal year 2015, with an expected high-single digit rate of annual per-share earnings growth in fiscal 2016 and 2017. ConAgra shares rose 0.9% premarket.CORRECTED: Accenture says quarterly revenue climbs 7% to top estimates(7:28 AM ET) (Corrects to remove adjusted EPS number that was from the year earlier) NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Accenture /quotes/zigman/565535/delayed/quotes/nls/acn ACN +0.60% said Thursday it had net income of $881.8 million, or $1.26 a share, in its fiscal third quarter, up from $874.1 million, or $1.21, in the same period a year ago. Revenues rose 7% to $7.74 billion, above the companys expectations, as new bookings totaled $8.8 billion. The FactSet consensus was for per-share earnings of $1.21 and revenue of $7.546 billion. The consulting firm said it now expects fourth-quarter revenue of $7.45 billion to $7.70 billion. For fiscal 2014, the company is expecting revenue growth in a range of 4% to 5%.

Diluted earnings per share for 2014 are now forecast to be in a range of $4.87 to $4.97, compared with the range of $5.09 to $5.19 given on May 7 by the tobacco maker. We continue to face significant currency headwinds, an improving but weak macro-economic environment in the EU and known challenges in Asia, partly offset by a robust performance in a number of markets and the contribution of our business development initiatives, Philip Morriss Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos said in a statement on Thursday. Furthermore, we have recently witnessed significant price discounting at the low end of the market in Australia. Philip Morris, which is holding a two-day investor meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, also said it expects to take a pretax charge of about $495 million, or 24 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2014 as a result of halting cigarette production at a factory in the Netherlands.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=DB3404E9-9C53-4A33-B88C-7EA21A65BE87&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26
S&P 500, Dow slip on Bullard rate comments; GoPro surges: Stock market live blog recap	Here’s a recap of our live-blog of Thursday’s market action. You can find a compact rundown of the day’s trading activity in Market Snapshot.  Welcome to the stock market live blog. Stock losses are deepening 20 minutes after the session. Is this thanks to comments from St. Louis Fed President Bullard?Dow is off 101 points. Here’s what Bullard is saying:Sees the first rate hike at the end of the first quarter. That’s in contrast to what the fed funds futures market has been saying.

He said same back in May; http://t.co/QWUVvfnuWm …— Dan Greenhaus (@DanBTIG) June 26, 2014Stock index futures didn’t respond much to the morning economic reports. But on the subject of rate hikes, we should note that the Fed’s favorite inflation indicator — the core PCE  inflation index — rose to 1.5% in May from the year ago month, the highest since February 2013. That sent bond yields lower ahead of the Bullard comments.  We’re keeping our eyes out for the start of trading for GoPro Inc. /quotes/zigman/34007695/delayed /quotes/nls/gpro GPRO , the company that makes wearable sports cameras. The shares priced Wednesday night at $24 apiece, the high end of earlier expectations. The company raised $427 million, which could increase if underwriters decide to buy additional shares.In the meantime, Asheesh Advani writes about the offering:“The valuation is high and the risks are palpable. The $24 per share pricingvalues GoPro at about $3 billion, with a higher price-to-earnings ratio than Apple. Clearly this valuation is not purely based on the business prospects of selling its durable cameras, as most consumer-electronics products become commoditized fairly quickly. The real investor appetite for GoPro is based on the potential to monetize the sharing of all the mind-bending videos filmed by its customers.”Read more here.Here are Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists, led by Michael Hartnett, who are continuing to hammer at the theme that we will get a summer melt-up in stocks until the fat lady sings in the fall.

Here’s what their team of strategists forecasts for the next six months in stocks:“Stocks have outperformed bonds so far, and are on a pace that suggests returns could end the year in the mid to upper single digits. Not a great year, in other words, but a decent one. Despite the rally in bonds and corresponding sharp drop in interest rates, we maintain our early year outlook: We still expect rates to trend up, if only modestly. Our core view of the economy also stands: improving, but still below-trend growth. And one development we’re watching closely: tentative signs of a pickup in U.S. inflation.”MarketWatch’s Brett Arends has a Thursday column about how to beat exchange-traded funds by improving on the formula with a little elbow grease. He mentions five specific strategies, which you can read more about here. He’s also got a bone to pick with the growing ETF industry:“Most ETFs, when you think about it, are built on a contradiction. They tell you to spread your bets across the entire market, but then they pour a disproportionate share of their money into the few stocks with the highest values — Apple and Google  and Exxon  and so on. They tell you that all stocks offer the same risk-adjusted prospective returns, and then put more money in the most popular stocks than they do in the bottom 100.“This ‘capitalization-weighted’ indexing makes sense for only one reason: It serves the interests of the money management companies, because it is easily scalable and easily manageable.”Liveblogging about mkts during the #USAvsGER match even as traders slack off with @BenEisen http://t.co/ivPxN35A66 pic.twitter.com/C2cdbB0gSH— Anora Mahmudova (@AnoraJourno) June 26, 2014Barclays PLC  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/152323/delayed /quotes/nls/bcs BCS  shares fell 6.5% in trading the day after the New York Attorney General accused the bank of favoring high-frequency traders over regular investors.Eric Schneiderman filed civil charges on Wednesday against Barclays, alleging the bank misrepresented the number of high-frequency traders in its private-trading platform, known as a dark pool.The Attorney General also accused the British bank of not protecting investors from predatory trading behavior.“The integrity of the markets is a top priority of Barclays,” said the bank in a statementIs GoPro Inc. done with its trading-debut surge for the day?

He offers a list of 6 reasons why stocks have ground out record high after record high in the second quarter:1. The short-term interest rate remains close to zero. 2. Long-term government bond rates fell when they were expected to rise worldwide.3. Reports of worldwide inflation continued at very low levels in most jurisdictions. In Europe, the inflation rate is now recorded at 0.50%. 4. Central bank policies continue to be expansive. Even though the Federal Reserve (Fed) is tapering, it is still expanding excess reserves and acquiring assets onto its balance sheet. 5. The federal deficit continues to shrink. It has gone from a run rate of $1.4 trillion at its peak to an annualized run rate of $400 billion, and the number if falling. 6. The growing U.S. energy self-sufficiency is evolving and is resulting in shrinking trade and current account deficits. We do not import as much oil and energy as we used to. We produce much more. The trends continue in that direction. That means that dollars do not flow abroad; therefore, those dollars do not have to be attracted back to the U.S. by higher interest rates or other investment returns.The bell has rung.

10-year yield falls to four-week low after auction	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe 10-year note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR 0.00%  yield, which falls as prices rise, was down 3 basis points at 2.530%, its lowest close since May 30. The yield lingered near its lowest closing level in 11 months — 2.438% — which it touched on May 28.The 7-year notes /quotes/zigman/4868264/delayed 7_YEAR 0.00% sold at a yield of 2.152%. Bidders offered to buy 2.44 times the amount of debt sold, below the average 2.60 times during the past six sales.“This afternoon’s 7-year note auction did not go well,” said John Canavan, bond market analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, in a note.Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks, offered to buy 40.6% of the sale, compared with 43.7% in recent auctions. Direct bidders, which include domestic money managers, bought 16.7% of the sale, versus 22.9% in recent auctions.  Yields were down Thursday on a mixture of dovish monetary policy comments in Europe and escalating geopolitical tensions in Iraq, two factors which have supported the market in recent weeks. That helped spark a technical push toward recent yield lows, according to Thomas di Galoma, head of fixed-income rates at ED&F Man Capital Markets.“You had those two things hitting the market, as well some month-end extensions that seem to be taking the markets higher in price and lower in yield,” he said.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR 0.00%  yield fell 2.5 basis points to 3.355% and the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR 0.00%  yield dropped 3.5 basis points to 1.650%.Bonds shrugged off mixed economic data.

Zulily upgrades are signs of a burgeoning trend	By Rex Crum, MarketWatchOn Thursday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney raised his rating on Zulily /quotes/zigman/22855552/delayed/quotes/nls/zu ZU +1.55% to outperform, or the equivalent of buy, from sector perform, otherwise known as neutral. Mahaney also lifted his price target on Zulily’s stock to $50 a share from $45.Mahaney’s new views on Zulily came just one day after Debra Schwartz of Goldman Sachs upped her take on the company to buy from neutral, and also raised her price target on the company’s shares to $50 from $47.The back-to-back upgrades can be seen as evidence that Zulily may be, well, as good a deal as the items the retailer has for sale.If you’re not familiar with Zulily, here’s how the business works: It centers on deals, mostly for clothing and accessories, that usually don’t last more than a couple of days. The vast majority of Zulily’s offerings are geared toward women and children.Since I have a wife, and we have two daughters, ages 3 and 5, I often find my wife at almost any hour of the day cruising Zulily’s Website for the latest things that would look adorable on our girls, and which they will outgrow or destroy on the playground within months, if not weeks. But, the fact that my wife -- and so many other moms like her -- find Zulily so appealing shows the company certainly knows its audience well.”We have consistently viewed Zulily as a leading “mom” brand, with very high customer loyalty, [and] effective distribution for emerging brands and boutique vendors,” Mahaney said. As evidence, he cited an RBC survey of U.S. consumers in which 25% of respondents said they had made purchases from Zulily and 67% of customers said they were either extremely or very satisfied with Zulily’s products.That selection has expanded, according to Mahaney, who said that in the first quarter of 2014, non-children’s apparel made up 61% of the company’s orders. “Zulily has been proving out its value proposition to vendors and consumers,” he said. “And providing further evidence of a potentially highly attractive financial model.”While both Mahaney and Schwartz thought well enough of Zulily to raise their price targets on the company’s stock, those views were aided by what has been a big decline in Zulily’s shares over the past four months. Zulily, which went public on Nov. 15, 2013, has seen its stock price fall by 45% since reaching a high of $73.50 on Feb. 27, as the company was caught up in a broad selloff of Internet stocks that began in March and has only recently stabilized.But, according to Schwartz, that decline has resulted in “a good entry point [for the stock] as the company expands its merchandising, fulfillment and marketing initiatives,” and should lead to higher-than-expected customer growth going into next year, and up to 10 million active customers and $3 billion in annual sales “over the next few years.”Two upgrades in one week. In the spirit of the World Cup that’s going on right now, one more would make a hat trick and could show that Zulily’s business is trending in the right direction.GoPro doesn’t disappoint in its public debutGoldman Sachs Internet of Things list doesn’t include Apple or GoogleAlibaba to list its shares on NYSE	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=65CAFF62-FD44-11E3-8AFC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Adidas pulls teeth-baring ads with Uruguay’s Suarez	By Sara GermanoThe German sportswear maker has an endorsement deal with the star striker including advertisements for its new line of Battle Pack cleats that show Mr. Suárez baring his teeth, an uncomfortable coincidence after he was sanctioned for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini in a game Tuesday.Adidas said its sponsorship deal with Mr. Suárez “remains unchanged at this time” but said it is working to take down the ads and won’t use him in additional marketing material during the World Cup.“We will again be reminding him of the high standards we expect from our players,” Adidas spokeswoman Lauren Lamkin said.The incident isn’t the first to come between Adidas and Mr. Suárez. In 2013, Mr. Suárez, playing for Liverpool of the English Premier League, appeared to bite an opponent on rival Chelsea.

Bullard: Markets think Fed is more dovish than it is	By Greg Robb, MarketWatchIn a speech in New York book-ended by a television interview and press conference, Bullard said investors, and even some Fed officials, are “stuck” in 2010 and don’t realize how close the central bank is to reaching its targets of low unemployment and stable prices.“I think investors should be listening to the committee, they are not,” Bullard said, when asked why the yield curve was below the median forecast of rates presented by the central bank in its last dot plot released after its meeting last week.“Yes, it is a dovish committee, but I don’t think investors should be pricing in an even more dovish committee than we’ve already got,” Bullard said.Bullard said the bond market rally this year and the low volatility was due to a dramatic shift in policy from the European Central Bank.Earlier in a television interview, Bullard said he still expects the first Fed rate hike to come at the end of 2015.He said the revised 2.9% plunge in first-quarter gross domestic product gave him heartburn, but he said the market was right to look past the data released on Wednesday.Bullard said the economy is actually doing “pretty good” and the Fed is closer to its targets than the markets realize.“I am starting to think the economy could tolerate at least a little bit of the central bank getting back to a more normal stance,” Bullard said.Bullard said he now expects inflation to move over the 2% target in 2015. The Fed will have to play its cards right to keep inflation under control, he said.When inflation moves above target, this will cause the discussion among Fed officials to “heat up,” Bullard said.After their most-recent meeting, which ended June 18, Fed officials predicted their target rate of inflation would be 1.13% at the end of 2015 and 2.5% at the end of the following year.The St. Louis Fed president is not a voting member of the Fed’s policy committee this year but his views often move markets.Bullard expressed satisfaction with the Fed’s draft exit plan made public in 2011, saying only that it needed a few changes.That plan sees the Fed stopping reinvesting principal from maturing assets on its balance sheet prior to the first rate hike.Some Fed officials, including William Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, said stopping reinvestment before the first rate hike might be a bad idea.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=01398E48-FD66-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Analysts surveyed by Platts had forecast a decline of 2 million barrels for crude.And economic data Thursday generally boded ill for the energy-demand outlook. The number of people who applied for U.S. unemployment benefits remained near a postrecession low. Consumers splurged on new cars and trucks in May, but not much else.Likely contributing to Thursday’s oil-price decline was also a report that Libya’s eastern Hariga oil port has reopened.Elsewhere on Nymex Thursday, prices for natural gas marked their first session decline in three.The EIA reported that supplies of natural gas rose 110 billion cubic feet for the week ended June 20. Analysts surveyed by Platts forecast an increase of between 102 billion cubic feet and 106 billion cubic feet.The report “was a clear bearish surprise,” said Citi Futures’ Evans. “Although there may be some minor changed in underlying demand contributing to this surprise, our guess is that this represents a step up to a higher production level, with bearish implications for the weeks ahead as well.”July natural gas  settled at $4.40 per million British thermal units, down 15 cents, or 3.4%. It was trading at around $4.54 before the supply data.August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 -0.89% which became the front-month contract at the close, fell 13 cents, or 2.8%, to $4.44 per million Btus.Rounding out the action on Nymex Thursday, July gasoline  less than a penny to $3.09 a gallon, while July heating oil  fell 1.6 cents to $3.01 a gallon.5 (more) cheap stocks in the energy sectorYellen needs to focus more on inflation, less on jobs	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8A8497F6-FD2A-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Gold futures snap six-session winning streak	By Myra P. Saefong, MarketWatchGold for August delivery /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.05%  fell $5.60, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,317 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices settled at $1,322.60 on Wednesday, the highest level for a most-active contract since April 14.July silver /quotes/zigman/698627/delayed SIN4 +0.34%  closed down about a cent at $21.11 an ounce.“The gold price is building up strength to tackle the mid- to high-$1,320s before attacking more overhead resistance,” said Julian Phillips, founder of and contributor to GoldForecaster.com. “I see the fall as part of the usual ebb and flow of prices.”“With the suppuration of the sectarian war in the [Middle East], the initial shock has been absorbed but the implications have not,” he said. “Today, we see Syria and Iran joining in the fray as a signal of things to come while we are expecting Jordan to be dragged in soon.”A report Thursday said that China authorities uncovered a $15 billion gold-financing scheme that began two years ago. Read about China authorities’ recent probe into the use of metals, including copper, to obtain loans.“The Chinese story is a likely bullish force for gold and may partially explain the massive buying behind the June 19 rally,” said Mike Armbruster, principal and co-founder at Altavest.Chinese gold processing firms have used falsified gold transactions to borrow 94.4 billion yuan ($15.2 billion) from banks since 2012, the country’s chief auditor said, according to a report from Reuters Thursday.Gold futures on Thursday had dropped to as low as $1,306.80 in electronic trading. They pared some of their losses immediately after the release of U.S. economic data. U.S. consumer spending rose less than expected, and the PCE index, the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, rose to its highest 12-month rate since October 2012.Armbruster called the pullback in gold temporary.“Long-term interest rates are falling with stock prices and that is fundamentally bullish,” he said. “Geopolitical considerations at the margins are also constructive, but not the key driving force for the yellow metal, in our opinion. Strong global demand and limited production also point gold higher in the big picture.”Prices for the yellow metal also briefly pared their decline shortly after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said inflation should move above 2% in 2015 and is likely to spark a heated debate at the U.S. central bank about the level of interest rates. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation.Also among the key metals traded on Comex Thursday, prices for copper settled nearly flat, with the July contract /quotes/zigman/678460/delayed HGN4 -0.21%  ending at $3.17 a pound.

States with the most credit card debt	By Christine DiGangi, Credit.comAs shown by the data, sorted using Experian’s IntelliView tool, it seems people are either charging less often or paying off more of their card balances . The national average in outstanding credit card debt declined $27 year over year. It’s a good thing, considering higher balances mean consumers pay more in interest (here’s a quick explainer of how APR works ).The biggest change was in Oregon, where the average balance dropped $102 since the start of 2013 and $192 since the start of 2012. There was no change recorded among Pennsylvania credit card users, and Hawaii saw the largest spike (up $49) between first quarter 2013 and 2014.Average balances may have gone down, but credit card spending is far from falling out of favor. Twenty-three state averages exceed the national mean, some by as much as 18% (on the far end, some states’ consumers had 23% less credit card debt than the national average). With only two exceptions, the states with the highest average credit card balances per consumer are located up and down the East Coast. Here are the 10 states with the highest average credit card debt:Despite the fact that Alaskans reduced their average credit card debt by $200 since the start of 2012, they’ve held the top slot in these rankings in the first quarter for the past two years. New Jersey residents are quickly closing the gap, though, even with an overall decline of $114 in their debt average. Only Vermont has seen as little as a single-digit decline in average credit card debt since 2012 ($7), but at No. 35, that’s probably not much reason for concern.When it comes to the weight of debt, outstanding balances aren’t the only numbers that matter. Even with a comparatively high average balance, average credit limits vary by state as well, and the farther apart those numbers are, the better it is for the consumers. Whether or not you pay your balance in full has no effect on your credit scores (at least, not directly), but paying on time and keeping your debt-to-limit ratio low will help you build credit. By reviewing your credit profile — which you can do for free through Credit.com — you will get a good idea of how your credit card use impacts your credit scores and use that information to make any changes that will improve your credit standing.This article originally appeared on Credit.com.More from Credit.com:How to Pay Off Credit Card DebtTips for Improving Your Credit: Your Amount of DebtWhen Do Balance Transfer Credit Cards Make Sense?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=2A2605C0-FD5C-11E3-B93C-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-06-26

Ukrainian government troops target further gains	By Alan Cullison and Philip ShiskinDefense Minister Valeriy Heteley told reporters in Izyum, the city where the military has set up its base for the two-month-old operation against the separatists, that there would be no letup in the drive by government forces. “We will continue the active phase until the moment when on the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk region there is not a single terrorist left,” he said, adding that the government hopes for a quick victory.Just a day earlier, troops hoisted the Ukrainian flag in Slovyansk, a city that had been a center of separatist resistance since armed pro-Russian rebels took over several cities in the region in April. Militants also abandoned nearby Kramatorsk, pulling back toward Donetsk to the southwest. Ukrainian officials said the towns of Druzhivka and Kostyantynivka had also been retaken.Despite the symbolic victories on Saturday—probably the biggest wins for government troops since the operation began in mid-April—President Petro Poroshenko warned that more hard fighting lies ahead. “This is not a complete victory,” he said in a televised address. “This is the beginning of a breakthrough in the fight against militants for the territorial integrity of Ukraine.”Rebel leaders sought to characterize the retreats as strategic moves to strengthen their defense, claiming they had managed to evacuate large numbers of fighters and weapons from the cities retaken by Ukrainian forces. Kiev officials denied those claims.But hundreds of militants entered Donetsk on Saturday, raising the prospect of urban warfare in Ukraine’s largest city. Igor Strelkov, the pseudonym of the Russian citizen who had commanded the militants in Slovyansk, was in Donetsk on Sunday preparing defenses, separatist officials said.Russia’s official RIA-Novosti news agency quoted Strelkov as saying Donetsk would be easier to defend than the smaller Slovyansk.“We will try not to make the same mistakes we did in the past. We will be able to prepare for the enemy’s next attack more thoroughly,” RIA-Novosti quoted him as saying in a video address.Ukrainian officials vowed to use only special forces within the cities, avoiding heavy bombardment.On Sunday morning, Donetsk was quiet. The local media reported scattered shooting around the airport, but that couldn’t immediately be confirmed. Many residents have fled the city in recent months amid fighting.Separatists also control Luhansk, the capital of the neighboring region, and there were reports of fighting between rebels and Ukrainian troops along the Russian border in that region Saturday.Moscow didn’t publicly comment on the separatists’ retreat Saturday. State-television coverage of it highlighted the rebels’ claims it was a tactical retreat and allegations that Ukrainian forces had destroyed the cities in taking them. Witnesses said Slovyansk and Kramatorsk were largely intact, however.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C39BBC8E-050B-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-06
Petra Kvitova beats Eugenie Bouchard to win Wimbledon	By Steven KutzKvitova was so focused and dominant that she won in 55 minutes, the fastest victory in a women’s Wimbledon final in over 30 years.“Petra keeps this up and I’d give her a decent shot if she turns up tomorrow” for the men’s final, Darren Cahill, an ESPN commentator, tweeted after the first set.With former Wimbledon champions Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova losing earlier than expected, the stage was set for the former Wimbledon champion Kvitova, to win again. She first won the tournament in 2011.As Tom Perrotta of The Wall Street Journal pointed out, this was the first women’s Grand Slam final in which both players were born in the ‘90s.Bouchard, a 20-year-old from Canada who was named after the English Princess Eugenie of York, who was at the match, is the rare young player who doesn’t seem intimidated by the limelight on and off the court.She reached the semifinals of the Australian and French Opens this year before making it to the Wimbledon final. Her words and actions show that she expects to beat everyone she plays. And while some players shy away from the spotlight, she seems to invite it; after a victory earlier in the tournament, she wore a much-talked-about kimono to her post-match news conference.But she couldn’t beat Kvitova Saturday. In fact, it looked as if no one could have.Kvitova, a tall lefty with a powerful serve and forehand, is more shy.She has admitted that after she won Wimbledon in 2011, she struggled with the increased attention and expectations. As a result, her play became inconsistent, although she has always done well at Wimbledon, where the quicker grass courts suit her style of play well.Clearly everything the 24-year-old Kvitova has been through the past few years had her incredibly well prepared and confident she could win.And more Grand Slam finals may be in her future. “It’s my second title, so I hope that now it is going to be a little easier for me,” Kvitova said in an on-court interview.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=220C6D44-044F-11E4-BC05-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-05
Markets to receive clues about Fed’s views on jobs	By Ruth Mantell, MarketWatchThe minutes, to be released Wednesday, are for the Fed’s June meeting, which occurred before the U.S. Labor Department reported that employers ratcheted up hiring to a net gain of 288,000 nonfarm jobs last month. When the Fed met in June , all officials knew was that nonfarm employment gains had been north of 200,000 per month since February.There’s been concern about the degree to which a falling unemployment rate is overstating labor-market strength.“You’ll see, once again, general agreement that the labor market has been improving, but there will be difference in opinion about the drop in the unemployment rate,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.Officials have also been eyeing tepid wage growth.“Not all is rosy, especially from the Federal Reserve’s perspective,” said Doug Duncan, chief economist at federally controlled mortgage-finance giant Fannie Mae /quotes/zigman/226360/delayed/quotes/nls/fnma FNMA +0.25% . “Despite the improved pace of hiring, wage gains remain weak, implying the persistence of considerable slack in the labor market.”Fed watchers can also look for hints in the June minutes about whether officials further considered an idea from William Dudley , president of the regional Fed bank in New York, about moving first on interest rates before tackling the central bank’s stimulus-swollen balance sheet.“The [Fed’s June] meeting itself didn’t have a lot of excitement. The minutes could be more interesting and offer a bit more detail about the exit plan,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, a U.S. strategist at TD Securities.Or, there may be no new information on that front, with officials waiting until their next meeting for a detailed conversation.“I think the discussion of potential tools regarding exit strategy will have continued, but I don’t expect the minutes will reveal any clear consensus at this stage as to the exact mechanics of it,” said Andrew Grantham, an economist at CIBC World Markets.Aside from the release of the Fed minutes, this week’s economic calendar is fairly light. There will be reports on small businesses, job turnover and consumer credit.The latter may be of interest after the 10.2% surge in consumer credit in April.“The growing dependence on debt could prolong consumer spending a few more months,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group. “But in the absence higher real wages, this type of consumption cannot last much longer, certainly not if we see both gas prices and inflation-driven interest rates edge higher later this year.”Check out these must-read MarketWatch stories:A look at progress on jobs and pay since Civil Rights ActMore than half of 2014′s new jobs pay higher than average wage	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=19DBF3D4-02CD-11E4-8F8A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-06

Wal-Mart embracing smaller stores in growth strategy	By Shelly BanjoIt was a surprising order from the top of a company that long ago devised one of retail’s most successful formulas and milked it for nearly half a trillion dollars in sales last year. According to the book, Bezos himself studied Wal-Mart as he built Amazon /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN -2.92% , internalizing its credo of acting fast and experimenting often.But now, with the price gap shrinking between Wal-Mart Stores Inc. /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed/quotes/nls/wmt WMT +0.76% and its competitors, the retailing giant faces the double sorrow of sluggish sales and traffic.In May, the company reported its fifth straight quarter of negative U.S. sales, excluding newly opened or closed stores, and its sixth straight quarter of dwindling traffic. Wal-Mart’s return on investment dropped to 17% in the year ended Jan. 31, down from 20% seven years ago. The weak results led to the lowest levels of bonuses to executives in several years.The discounter is also dogged by allegations of bribery overseas, and continues to face regulatory challenges from its nonunionized workforce. It has stumbled in country after country in its attempts to expand overseas, even as it remains a dominant retailing force in countries like Mexico and Canada.For McMillon, who at 47 years-old is the youngest CEO to lead the company since founder Sam Walton, the problems of the past are forcing him headlong into the future. Since taking the helm in February, Wal-Mart executives say he has doled out urgent instructions to accelerate new store concepts and online strategies in an attempt to gain back market share from encroaching rivals like Amazon and fast-expanding dollar store chains.It’s a tall order. “We need to move fast,” the CEO said at the company’s June shareholders meeting. “That’s why we’re piloting so many new ideas.”Even speed and imagination may not be enough to move the dial meaningfully for the country’s largest company as measured by revenues. To achieve 1% sales growth in any given year, the retail behemoth must pull in nearly $5 billion in additional sales.The U.S. recession had brought some relief, as battered shoppers sought rock-bottom prices. But Wal-Mart’s low-income customers — who spend 18% of all food- stamp money at the chain— have been slow to recover.Some of the retailer’s initiatives — from new store formats to a shift in some pricing models — don’t much resemble the old Wal-Mart, where bigger stores were touted as better, and prices were “always low.”This year, for the first time in its history, Wal-Mart will open more smaller grocery and convenience-type stores than supercenters. At 10,000 to 40,000 square feet, its Wal-Mart Express and Neighborhood Market concepts are a fraction of the size of a 200,000-square-foot superstore. Stores now double as pickup stations for shoppers to collect televisions, bicycles and other items purchased online.Taking a page from Costco Wholesale Corp. /quotes/zigman/67728/delayed/quotes/nls/cost COST +0.98% , the big-box king of booze, Wal-Mart has said that it aims to double its alcohol sales by 2016. The chain is weighing plans to build free-standing liquor stores in states like Florida which prohibit retailers from selling booze inside grocery stores, according to Wal-Mart employees.Unlike some of his predecessors McMillon embraced e-commerce early on. As such, some of the more sweeping changes are evident online, where Wal-Mart has been particularly stung by Amazon’s product breadth and pricing models.At its website, Wal-Mart has quietly scrapped the “everyday low prices” model that underpins its stores. Instead, it is using a “dynamic pricing” system, similar to Amazon’s, which frequently changes prices based on fluctuating data and competitive offerings.The online assortments also now include upscale items like $146 Nike sunglasses and wine refrigerators costing more than $2,500 — things that might appeal to customers who never set foot in a Wal-Mart.Another Amazon-like feature touts a “value of the day” and a “value of the hour” complete with countdown clock. At Amazon, shoppers troll for “today’s deals.”Last year, Wal-Mart pulled ahead of Amazon in terms of its web sales growth rate. According to data from Internet Retailer, the chain’s online sales in the year ended Jan. 31 rose 30% to $10 billion. Amazon, by comparison, posted a 20% gain on $68 billion in revenues from sales of electronics, media and other products during the year ended Dec. 31.Wal-Mart’s e-commerce war chest illustrates McMillon’s desire to get clicking faster. In the year ended Jan. 31, Wal-Mart plowed roughly $500 million into e-commerce investments, including three new online fulfillment centers and 1,000 employees in Silicon Valley. In February, Wal-Mart told investors it planned to spend an additional $150 million on e-commerce investments this year.McMillon’s forward march unsettles some investors, who worry about whether the smaller formats and online sales will cannibalize business at its traditional stores and dent profits.“You’re basically saying thousands of supercenters are going the way of the horse and buggy,” says Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin. “It’s a scary thing.”While he predicts that the new initiatives are apt to make a negative impact over the next few quarters, Mushkin believes that management is looking beyond short-term results.“Doug isn’t there to make next quarter or next year’s earnings,” says Mushkin. “He’s there to try to bring Wal-Mart into the 21st century.”	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=58DA3EE0-0671-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

China consumer inflation, wholesale deflation both ease	LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Chinas consumer inflation and wholesale deflation both moderated slightly in June, data out Wednesday showed, with the figures not far from what economists had expected, and with market reaction subdued. Chinas consumer price index printed 2.3% higher than a year earlier, representing a slight 0.1% dip on a monthly basis. The result was just below the 2.4% gain projected in separate Dow Jones Newswires and Reuters surveys of economists. It marked a moderate pullback from Mays 2.5% inflation rate, with a fourth straight decline for fresh-vegetable prices helping limit the indexs gains. Meanwhile, the producer price index was 1.1% lower than in June 2013, a monthly decline of 0.2%, making Junes wholesale deflation the smallest in more than a year. In May, the PPI had fallen 1.4% from the year-ago level. Both the Dow Jones Newswires and Reuters polls had yielded an average expectation for a 1% decrease. Chinese stocks added modestly to their losses after the data, with Hong Kongs Hang Seng Index /quotes/zigman/2622475/delayed HK:HSI -1.25% down 1% compared to a premarket deficit of 0.6%, while the Shanghai Composite Index /quotes/zigman/1859015/delayed CN:SHCOMP -0.32% was 0.3% lower compared to a 0.1% loss in premarket quotes. The Australian dollar /quotes/zigman/4867876/realtime/sampled AUDUSD -0.0173% , often sensitive to Chinese economic data, eased to 94.08 U.S. cents from 94.12 U.S. cents moments before the data release.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C2880A12-D818-410E-B09D-380D42FF3EAB&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Treasurys surge, holding gain after 3-year auction	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +0.39%  yield, which falls as prices rise, sank 5.5 basis points to 2.565%, according to Tradeweb. The benchmark yield notched the biggest two-day drop since the end of May as investors stepped in to buy long-term U.S. government debt in the wake of a rise in yields last week.Treasury prices began rising Tuesday as U.K. factory output unexpectedly fell in May by the most since the beginning of last year. The rally continued as U.S. stocks retreated , sending investors into the safety of the U.S. debt market.“It looks like a typical risk-off move,” said David Keeble, global head of interest-rate strategy at Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.The Treasury Department sold $27 billion in 3-year notes /quotes/zigman/4868286/delayed 3_YEAR +5.99%  at a yield of 0.992%, its highest yield since May 2011. The government continued to cut the sizes of some of its shorter-term debt sales, with the 3-year auction declining in size from $30 billion in April.The 3-year note yield, which is sensitive to expectations of monetary policy, has been rising since the end of May amid signs of an improving economy that some investors think will put pressure on the Fed to hike the policy rate earlier.Nonetheless, buyers showed up for the auction, with bidders offering to buy 3.38 times the amount of debt sold, compared to an average of 3.35 times in the last six sales. Nomura Securities strategists gave the auction a grade of A-.Read the full auction details.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR +0.21%  yield fell 5.5 basis points to 3.382% and the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR +0.35%  yield dropped 3.5 basis points to 1.699%.Treasurys held gains after a report showed the number of job openings hit 4.64 million in May, the most since June 2007 . Worker confidence improved as 2.53 million workers quit in May, up 15% from a year earlier. However, the number of hires in May was at 4.72 million, below the levels at the onset of the recession. The hiring rate and quits rate are among Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s favored labor market gauges .Jeffrey Lacker of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank said on Tuesday that the Fed should be preemptive by hiking its interest rates before inflation emerges. Meanwhile, Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Minneapolis Fed, down-played the recent rise in inflation during a speech.Weidner: Dow 17,000 is on the wrong side of historyKellner: Say hello to U.S. economy’s newest bubble7 market myths that make investors poorer	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E3C83042-069A-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Euro, pound reverse losses against dollar	By Joseph Adinolfi and Carla Mozee, MarketWatchThe dollar’s fluctuations are a continuation of action seen following the better-than-expected U.S. jobs report last Thursday, said Ian Gordon, senior FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The ICE dollar index /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY -0.02% , which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of its rivals, finished the day down slightly at 80.176 from 80.227 on Monday.A continuing decline in Treasury yields is also putting pressure on the dollar, Gordon said.The pound /quotes/zigman/4867886/realtime/sampled GBPUSD +0.0165%  closed at $1.7132 Tuesday, compared with $1.7134 on Monday.The pound had sunk earlier after manufacturing output fell 1.3% in May, according to the Office of National Statistics. That marked the first fall since November last year and the biggest decline since January 2013.Weaker-than-expected trade data from Germany added to evidence of slowing in Europe’s largest economy, causing the euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/realtime/sampled EURUSD +0.0368% to briefly dip.

The shares, which haven’t traded above $1 since Feb. 14, have run up 58% since June 24, but are still down 32% so far this year.1832 Asset Management said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it has sold all of the 11,509,433 common shares of American Apparel it still owned. Just two months earlier,1832 said the 11.5 million shares it owned represented a 6.6% stake in the company.

American Apparel disputed the claim.On Monday, Standard General, which effectively controls 43% of American Apparel shares through an arrangement with Dov Charney, said it was in talks with the company to restore it back to health.

Uber to follow New York’s price gouging laws	By Maria ArmentalUnder the agreement, Schneiderman said Uber has agreed to limit fares to “the normal range of prices it charged in the preceding sixty days,” excluding the three highest prices charged on different days during that period.The San Francisco startup is expected to announce a national policy limiting price hikes during emergencies, Schneiderman said.The agreement to cap price increases during emergencies comes a day after the company said it was temporarily cutting its prices in New York City to make its rides cheaper than the average taxi ride.Uber, which allows users to “hail” cars through a smartphone app and sets fare prices based on demand, had been criticized for surge pricing in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, defended the practice saying it was a way of finding the “market price,” but told The Wall Street Journal in January he was working on a way to make surge pricing fairer by only hiking rates in neighborhoods with the most demand.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:7 market myths that make investors poorerDow 17,000 is on the wrong side of history	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0B03A236-06DC-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Alcoa swings to profit, tops targets	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Alcoa Inc. /quotes/zigman/246295/delayed/quotes/nls/aa AA +0.75% reported late Tuesday it earned $138 million, or 12 cents a share, in the second quarter, reversing a net loss of $119 million, or 11 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.

Analysts had been looking for $5.63 billion in sales. Alcoa stuck by its earlier forecast for global aluminum demand to rise 7% in 2014. Alcoa shares were up 1.5% at $15.07 in after-hours trade.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0E278650-2C43-40CD-9D20-1A345136B118&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Dow falls by triple digits, closes back under 17,000: stock market live blog recap	We live blogged all the action in the stock market on Tuesday. For a concise rundown of the day’s trading activity, see Market Snapshot.Caution prevails. The opening bell saw stocks in retreat as investors pull back ahead of the start of earnings season, pulling the Dow Jones Industrial Average back below the 17,000 level it cleared for the first time last week.S&P 500 — down 8, or 0.4%, at 1,970DJIA — down 72, or 0.4%, at 16,951Nasdaq Composite — down 16, or 0.4%, at 4,435With earnings season set to kick off, one of the market’s prevailing themes is that investors want to see signs the improving economy is finally starting to deliver sales and earnings growth.As Jerry Webman, chief economist at Oppenheimer Funds, put it in a note: “After all, valuations are looking fuller as share prices continue to creep higher, companies will need to justify those valuations in coming quarters by delivering results.”All well and good, but Webman goes on to note that there’s a downside on the earnings from private-sector jobs growth. After all, “every private-sector job created is some company’s payroll expense.” Webman writes:While it’s encouraging to see businesses growing confident enough to make new hires (and spend on capital equipment), these expenditures could hurt profit margins in the short to medium terms. That’s why, for the last several months, I’ve been recommending that equity investors focus on shares in companies that (a) don’t rely on overwhelming economic growth to prosper and (b) can thrive without the need to spend heavily on new employees and equipment.   As the U.S. economy picks up steam, who is leading the pack?Check out this look at the country’s fastest-growing state economies. We’d note that some states on the list, like South Dakota and Idaho, were propelled by their agricultural sectors. Grain prices are now in retreat.Stocks are adding to early losses, with the Dow putting further distance between itself and the 17,000 level as it’s decline extends to triple digits.S&P 500 — down 11, or 0.5%, at 1,967DJIA — down 100, or 0.6%, at 16,925Nasdaq Composite — down 40, or 0.9%, at 4,412Shares of AbbVie Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/13067932/delayed /quotes/nls/abbv ABBV are in retreat after the biopharmaceutical firm raised its offer for U.K.-based Shire PLC by 11%.It’s not much of a market mover, but data showed May job openings rose to 4.64 million from 4.46 million a month earlier.The Dow remains down 117 points, or 0.7%, at 16,907, while the S&P 500 is off 12, or 0.6%, at 1,966. The Nasdaq Composite leads the way lower, down 1.1% at 4,404. We need to talk about Germany.The euro zone’s largest economy is starting to sputter. That’s a concern as the Teutonic powerhouse has been the engine of growth for the euro zone. And while the region’s sovereign debt crisis has been resting on the back burner, growth and the threat of deflation have forced the European Central Bank to take ever more extraordinary actions and to edge toward the path of outright quantitative easing.MarketWatch’s Sara Sjolin has a must-read take on Germany’s run of less-than-stellar data and why it matters.Speaking of earnings growth, Philip van Doorn has a breakdown of 6 companies that should report big-time earnings gains.Rob Stein, CEO of Astor Investment Management said that Tuesday’s pullback is mostly due to technicals rather than fundamentals.“When markets reach new peaks, investors tend to take opportunity and lighten up and rebalance. We think the economy is in its mid cycle and has more room to grow. All recent economic data point to acceleration. In this environment our risk reward model is still favoring stocks with decent expected returns for the next several quarters.”Brian Andrew, chief investment officer at Cleary Gull, says investors should go beyond economic cycles when deciding whether to buy a fund. He talks to Chuck Jaffe.Via Claudia Assis:Shares of Tesla Motors Inc. fell 3% on Tuesday, bringing weekly losses to 6.2% so far. Tesla is being sued in China for trademark infrigement, according to news reports.Tesla began delivering Model S sedans in China in April, after saying that a trademark dispute with Chinese businessman Zhan Baosheng had been resolved.Zhan had registered the trademark “Tesla” and is now taking the electric car maker to court to demand it stop sales and marketing in China. A Beijing court will hear the case on Aug. 5Irwin Kellner, MarketWatch’s chief economist writes that stocks are way overdue for a correction.“When good news is good news, and bad news is good news, it’s time to take some money off the table.Call it irrational exuberance, part two. Like old man river, the stock market just keeps rolling along. Last week it was Dow 17,000. Will this week see the market go even higher?… there are a number of warning signs out there that suggest the party may soon be over.”Look for bears and shorts to come out of hiding again and questions about the rally being over to take over the news flow.— Bespoke (@bespokeinvest) July 8, 2014Hitting $SOCL and $XBI hard here, similar to March-April, different kind of selling than we’ve seen, taking down momentum.— Charlie Bilello, CMT (@MktOutperform) July 8, 2014Momentum names acting like they did in March and April last two days.

Low inflation means that resources are being wasted, Kocherlakota added, notably in the form of unemployed workers. “There is still significant underutilization of our country’s most important resource – its people,” he said.The unemployment rate, which fell to 6.1% in June “could well overstate the degree of improvement in the U.S. labor market,” he added. As a result, the Fed is undershooting its price stability objective and underperforming its maximum employment objective, he said.

U.S. consumer credit remains strong in May	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- U.S. consumer credit growth remained strong in May but not at the fast pace seen in April, the Federal Reserve reported Tuesday. U.S. consumers increased their debt in May by a seasonally adjusted $19.6 billion, down from a revised $26.1 billion gain in the prior month. This was close to the market consensus. Monthly debt rose at a 7.4% annual rate in May, compared with a 10.0% rate in the prior month, which was the strongest rate since July 2011. Non-revolving category of debt, especially federal student loans, stayed strong, rising $17.8 billion or 9.3% in May, the third straight month of a 9% gain. Credit-card debt increased $1.8 billion or 2.5% after a surge of $8.8 billion, or 12.3% in the prior month.

Rengan Rajaratnam found not guilty of insider trading: report	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Former hedge fund manager Rengan Rajaratnam has been found not guilty of conspiracy to commit insider trading, according to a report on CNBC. The jury took just one day to deliberate the one count of conspiracy against Rajaratnam. Rajaratnam is the younger brother of Raj Rajaratnam, who is currently serving 11 years in prison for multiple counts of insider trading charges. Rengan was accused of working with his brother and using confidential information to make trades for a profit. He was initially charged with six counts of conspiracy to commit fraud, but had five of the charges dropped against him after the judge in the case determined there is not enough evidence that he made the illegal trades. This would be one of the few not guilty verdicts for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara who has produced 81 convictions or guilty pleas out of 86 people charged for insider trading.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=96B2551D-AD75-482F-A36D-1CAD0C307CFE&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Market timing gets a bad rap	By L.A. LittleIf you stop to think about it, that really does make sense. Unless you want to be all long all the time, fully riding the market waves from peak to valley, adding and subtracting a little as the market ebbs and flows is a viable alternative. Naturally that assumes you have a methodology that provides a reasonable method of timing, but there are methods available if one has the time and patience to discover them or can look to someone who sells the knowledge or tools to do so.Two recent examples of market timing have occurred this year. As you know, there was a real need to get more cautious in late January through the middle of May then to get more involved on the long side after that.In late January through April, there were significant corrections in many sectors, and it was almost enough to create a real correction in the indexes, as the Russell 2000 wobbled mightily toward the end of that period. Ye that larger correction never materialized, as the breakdown on the Russell 2000 failed to trigger. Once that became clear, the signals were given to become more bullish since higher price expectations were highly likely till the end of June and into July. The thesis was that performance anxiety would drive prices higher into the end of the quarter, in addition to the European Central Banks tailwind. But that is behind us now, so one has to look to whats next.Clearly earnings are the next big catalyst — up or down — and given that the market has ramped into the earnings season, they had better be a lot better than is already discounted or this market isnt going to appreciably move higher. There are plenty of reports out there about the lower number of warnings and the higher percentage of numbers bumps being reported, like Intel, which was highlighted in this column when they announced and were basically ignored.The point is that all of this is known news , and that is already discounted. Its what isnt know that isnt discounted. Will the new Targeted Long-Term-Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) in Europe really matter? Will negative interest rates across the pond increase loans portfolios? Will that grease the wheels of the European engines?Will economic data elsewhere show a humming U.S. and Asian economy, or will it be more of the same — uneven and spotty activity. These are the things that are not discounted because they are simply not known yet.So the question is, How can you tell what is next? In other words, “How can I time my entries or exits?”Well, if you believe that what people do with the money they manage shows up in the charts, then one might try to decipher what those charts are telling us. What does the supply and demand situation look like on the charts? Is there increasing demand at a higher price or decreasing? When price does retrace, do we see evidence of increased selling, or does the selling dry up? Thats the sort of thing that provides with clues as to what the market thinks. The charts reflect the collective consciousness and interpretation of all participants that comprise it, and right now what it appears to be saying is we have gone as high as we are going until we get more data.The best market signals resulting from the broad indexes have continually been given by the Russell 2000 /quotes/zigman/2759624/delayed RUT -1.23% . Last week, the Russell finally tested the highs from early March and failed on both price and volume. That failure was on the daily and weekly timeframes. That says the index should try to pull back, and if you noticed the ending numbers Monday, the Russell led the board to the downside.But its not just the Russell that is giving off signals. The fact that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has one of the more bullish setups it can have, yet was unable to move higher Monday is another signal that this market is starting to really struggle. The breakout over multiple swing-point highs on the short-term timeframe without any following through despite not being too extended nor having any overhead resistance is a negative signal as well.Yet another sign that exhaustion is likely setting in, at best, is that most bullish structures have completed. I dont have enough fingers to count all the bullish ABCD structures that completed over the past two or three days.As an example, heres a chart of the Nasdaq which had four separate ABCD structures on two different timeframes — all of which are done now. When the market makes the run and projections are hit, usually some measure of profits are booked by the professionals and that is what we are beginning to see now.So extensions are in on many indexes and sectors; sectors and indexes that should move higher are struggling to do so; and the best tell for months now is starting to come off the highs after a test failure with rapidity. That doesnt sound like a place to be doing much buying, but if you have been long, it sure seems like a logical place to do some selling on trading positions or even around the edges on core holdings.Thats what most professionals are likely doing, though few will ever tell you that.Disclosure: Little is long INTC.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F7A72F38-EB6E-416C-A674-633A7A4F38E8&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Intel, Dell, Samsung form Internet of Things alliance	By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatchThe group, called Open Interconnect Consortium, highlights the race to establish a strong position in what’s expected to be the next tech frontier: a wave of interconnected devices from smartphones and tablets to home appliances. The consortium also includes Atmel /quotes/zigman/68630/delayed/quotes/nls/atml ATML -2.48%  , Broadcom /quotes/zigman/66924/delayed/quotes/nls/brcm BRCM +0.05%  and Wind River.The consortium said it is “focused on defining a common communications framework based on industry standard technologies to wirelessly connect and intelligently manage the flow of information among personal computing and emerging Internet of Things devices, regardless of form factor, operating system or service provider.”Consortium members are expected to “contribute software and engineering resources to the development of a protocol specification, open source implementation, and a certification program, all with a view of accelerating the development of the IoT,” as the Internet of Things is also called.“The rise and ultimate success of the Internet of Things depends on the ability for devices and systems to securely and reliably interconnect and share information,” Intel software and services chief Doug Fisher said in a statement.“This requires common frameworks, based on truly open, industry standards. Our goal in founding this new consortium is to solve the challenge of interoperable connectivity for the Internet of Things without tying the ecosystem to one company’s solution.”Other tech giants, including Apple Inc. /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL -0.64%  and Google Inc. /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG -1.92%  , are also developing products and ecosystems aimed at this new arena, in which setting the dominant standards is seen as key to establishing a strong market position.Apple and Google are the dominant players in the mobile market, which gives the two giants an edge in the battle for dominance in the Internet of Things.In PCs, Intel /quotes/zigman/20392/delayed/quotes/nls/intc INTC -0.77%  and Dell, together with software behemoth Microsoft Corp. /quotes/zigman/20493/delayed/quotes/nls/msft MSFT -0.50%  , set the dominant standards that allowed them to dominate that market in the 80s and 90s. But the three companies have been hurt by the collapse of the PC market and have struggled to compete in the fast-growing mobile computing arena.Joining forces in the new IoT consortium may be a way for Intel and Dell to establish strong positions in the new arena, before market standards are set by other tech players led by Apple and Google.Other must-read stories from MarketWatch:Kim Kardashian dismisses PepsiCo CEO comments on women and workGoogle, Twitter, Facebook lead tech retreat	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=421F0022-06B8-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Beijing cuts Tesla out of charger-station plan	By Wu JingBut ongoing efforts to revise China’s standards for charging technology are plagued with technical disputes, and incompatibilities between those standards and the technology used by Tesla Motors Inc. /quotes/zigman/118681/delayed/quotes/nls/tsla TSLA -1.61%  mean that the charger network won’t support the company’s electric-car models.According to the plan by the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, the city will focus its efforts in the short term on building rapid chargers at major transportation hubs, including airports and train stations, as well as at public parking facilities, expressway service areas and other public places.The plan envisions that every spot within the city’s Fifth Ring Road will be within 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) of a station.But the focus on rapid-charging systems, which can charge electric cars in as little as half an hour, brings with it a host of problems. According to a source at the state-run electricity distributor, State Grid Corp., which is participating in the development of the national charging standard, the world has not settled on a single solution for rapid charging. China’s scheme will join proposals supported by standards bodies in Europe, the United States and Japan — along with a fifth system developed by Tesla.And while international differences in ordinary electrical outlets can be dealt with using simple converters, the devices may not be a safe solution for charging electric cars.As the State Grid source explained: “Charging an electric car isn’t ‘plug and play.’ There also needs to be a control circuit and communications protocol to ensure charging safety and interchangeability. One can’t simply add a converter and expect it to work.”This means Tesla is caught in a bind. The company’s rapid-charge “supercharger” technology is not compatible with car models from any other manufacturer, and government departments in China won’t support the construction of charging stations that don’t satisfy the emerging Chinese standard.And while the company said it will open its charging technology to other electric-car makers who agree to follow its model of no-cost charging for the life of the vehicle, the system is still proprietary, and the offer does not affect the drafting process for the Chinese national standard.The dispute holding back the release of the final Chinese standard centers around the “locking device,” an important part of any safe rapid-charging system. A management-level source in a foreign auto company responsible for charging infrastructure said the devices allow the charging system to first confirm the safe insertion of the charging plug, then lock the plug in place. Only after the devices confirm that everything is normal will electricity flow.A user who wants to stop the charging process must first press a stop button, and both sides will cut power. Only after this power cut is confirmed can the plug be disconnected. But unsafe systems that allow users to unplug the charging system freely are very common.So the question is: Where should the electronic lock be installed?The Chinese auto industry hasn’t agreed. Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. (SAIC) /quotes/zigman/1864453/delayed CN:600104 +0.97%  said it should be installed on the side of the charging station, while BYD Auto Co. /quotes/zigman/25819/delayed HK:1211 -2.99%   /quotes/zigman/5372078/delayed CN:002594 -1.83%   /quotes/zigman/25821/delayed/quotes/nls/byddf BYDDF +0.86%  , a leading domestic producer of electric cars, wants it to be mounted on the car. Europe and America put the lock on the car, while Japan places it on the station.Liu Yongdong, the deputy director of the standards center at China’s power-industry federation, said that “because everyone is standing their ground, we are taking into account everyone’s opinions and moving along according to the stipulations of the standardization law. We’re about three-fourths of the way there, and by the end of 2014 we will reach a conclusion” on the new edition of battery-charging interface standards.See this report at Caixin Online .

Adidas offers Manchester United sponsorship deal	By Sara GermanoIf signed, the offer by the German sporting-goods maker would rank among the most valuable of soccer sponsorships. Manchester United’s /quotes/zigman/11335627/delayed/quotes/nls/manu MANU -1.29%  existing $80 million a year deal with Chevrolet is the current team record.Nike /quotes/zigman/235840/delayed/quotes/nls/nke NKE -1.25%  , whose deal with Manchester United expires after next season, has the right to top any competing offers for the contract, but doesn’t want to pay that much and has notified the English Premier League team that it is walking away, the person said.The Beaverton, Ore.-based sportswear maker and Manchester United have been in talks for months about renewing the contract, even as their respective performances in soccer have diverged. Nike reported $2.3 billion in wholesale revenue from soccer for the year ended May 31, an 18% jump from a year earlier. Meanwhile, Manchester United was wrapping up its worst season on the pitch in more than 20 years.The potential deal is the latest move by Adidas /quotes/zigman/619210/delayed DE:ADS -0.10%  , the world’s second-largest sporting gear and equipment maker, to regain some ground from Nike.

Gold down third session to a more than 2-week low	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchGold for August delivery /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.62%  shed 50 cents to settle at $1,316.50 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices had already tallied a loss of nearly $14 an ounce, or 1.1%, over the past two trading sessions and based on the most-active contracts, closed Tuesday at their lowest since June 20.September silver /quotes/zigman/12294966/delayed SIU4 +0.79%  ended nearly flat $21.01 an ounce following a loss of 1.4% in the past two sessions.This is a “strange” market where gold demand is “steady and solid in a relatively thin market, but not swayed by speculators,” said Julian Phillips, founder of and contributor to GoldForecaster.com. “Speculators and dealers are trying to move gold around with the euro, which keeps going stronger as the dollar weakens.”But gold “keeps drifting higher as U.S. investors are now net buyers of the SPDR gold ETF in the last three weeks,” he said. Shares SPDR Gold Trust /quotes/zigman/41663/delayed/quotes/nls/gld GLD +0.04%  were last down 0.3%, but they trade roughly 9% higher year to date.“Technically, gold is looking good and should therefore rise over the week,” said Phillips.But Marex Spectron’s manager of precious metals David Govett said he believes that gold has “done enough on the upside for the time being,” although the downside is fairly limited.Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation and in a speech Tuesday, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, said keeping inflation under control will require the Federal Reserve to be pre-emptive. Separately, Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Minneapolis Fed, downplayed recent higher readings on inflation, saying he expects the price level to stay below the central bank’s target for several more years.Elsewhere in metals trading, October platinum /quotes/zigman/19534176/delayed PLV4 -0.34%  rose 90 cents, or 0.1%, to end at $1,496.50 an ounce, and September palladium /quotes/zigman/18010104/delayed PAU4 +0.37%  rose $3.95, 0.5%, to $872.90 an ounce.

Amazon offers e-book authors 100% of sales in Hachette row	By Jeffrey A. TrachtenbergAmazon made the proposal in a letter to a handful of authors and agents. If Hachette agrees to the idea, Amazon would also return to “normal levels of on-hand print inventory, return to normal pricing in all formats, and for books that haven’t gone on sale yet, reinstate pre-orders.” That would effectively reverse steps Amazon had taken in the wake of its fight with Hachette.Amazon /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN -2.92%   is pushing for a greater share of e-book revenue, and its negotiation with Hachette has turned into a messy, public battle. The retailer’s latest proposal suggests it is trying to win back the support of Hachette authors who say they have unfairly become collateral damage in the dispute.A letter circulated earlier this month by best-selling Hachette author Douglas Preston attacked Amazon for its handling of the continuing negotiations, which are in their third month. That letter has been signed by a number of major authors, including James Patterson and David Morrell.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Say hello to U.S. economy’s newest bubbleHow a big SUV and a home office can cut your tax billHow Dow 17,000 is on the wrong side of history	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A90A236C-06C6-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Apple’s China offensive faces new hurdles	By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatchUBS analyst Steven Milunovich said Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL -0.64%  may feel the impact of Samsung’s effort to shore up its share of the smartphone market in China, which has taken a hit according to the Korean company’s pre-announced results.Milunovich said Samsung is expected “to get more aggressive on pricing in China with the aim of thwarting scale gains by local vendors.”“The concern is that Samsung’s 15-20% share in China may not be enough to drive market trends, which may prompt more aggressive efforts to maintain share,” he wrote. “The good news for Apple is that demand for the iPhone 6 should likely be stellar, offsetting slow market growth with share gains.”Milunovich said Apple could also be hurt by the reported plan of China’s state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Council to push “telcos to reduce their sales and marketing costs by about 20%, out of which handset subsidies likely amount to more than one-third.”He noted that up to 60% of smartphone sales in China are subsidized, “so a reduction in subsidies could weigh on the high end of the market where Apple participates.”Still, China represents a major growth opportunity for Apple, particularly in high-end smartphones. Milunovich estimated that Apple sold about 12 million iPhones in China in the March quarter, a year-over-year growth of more than 25%.“Elasticity of the high-end user remains untested though more competitive pricing compounded by subsidy cuts could slow momentum,” he wrote. But he also noted that Apple’s “operating margin in China popped up nicely last quarter and bears watching.”Intel, Dell form Internet of Things allianceHow to fly on a private jet for under $200 a person	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=98AC2D20-06BD-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Treasurys hold gains after 3-year note auction	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- The Treasury Department sold $27 billion in 3-year notes /quotes/zigman/4868286/delayed 3_YEAR +5.99% Tuesday at a yield of 0.992%. Bidders offered to buy 3.38 times the amount of debt sold, compared to an average of 3.35 times at the last six sales. Indirect bidders, a group that includes foreign central banks, bought 38.2%, versus 30.3% in recent sales. Direct bidders, which include domestic money managers, purchased another 12.7.k%, versus an average of 20.4%. The broader bond market remained higher after the auction. Yields on 10-year notes /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +0.39% , which move inversely to prices, fell 6 basis points to 2.558%.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5114ABD9-1418-48F8-B806-12988BFEB81B&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Fed must be pre-emptive, hiking rate before inflation emerges: Lacker	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Keeping inflation under control will require the Federal Reserve to be pre-emptive, said Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, on Tuesday. Maintaining that good [inflation] performance will require withdrawing monetary stimulus at an appropriate time to prevent the emergence of inflationary pressures, Lacker said in a speech to the Rotary Club in Charlotte, N.C . Lacker, who is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee this year, said the Feds most recent forecasts released after its policy committee meeting last month show the first rate hike rising sometime next year while inflation is at or below the Feds 2% target. This is consistent with the FOMCs past practice of raising rates pre-emptively, he said. Lacker said inflation will likely continue to grow this year. The strong June job report is more representative of economic trends that the depressed first quarter gross domestic product measure, he said. But Lacker added he still expects growth to stay moderate this year, averaging between a 2% and 2.5% annual rate, in part because consumer spending wont accelerate significantly.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=78D48C3E-8372-47B7-BCA8-EA5931719E57&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Republicans pick Cleveland for 2016 national convention	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The Republican Party has selected Cleveland for its 2016 national convention, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Tuesday. The decision by a RNC site selection committee still needs to be ratified by the full committee in August, but it is widely expected to be approved. Dallas was the runner-up.

Mosaic offers solar-power loans with maintenance deal	By Claudia Assis, MarketWatchThe program provides homeowners who might purchase the solar panels peace of mind by providing upkeep services. It is also a “significant step forward” toward securitizing residential solar loans, Oakland, Calif.-based Mosaic said. That would allow large investors to bundle and sell solar-power loans like they do with mortgages.Lenders and investors have considered residential solar loans as riskier than residential solar leases because of the issue of who will maintain the panels. Solar-panel leases typically include maintenance service by the leasing company. Offering a guarantee of service by Petaluma, Calif.-based Enphase /quotes/zigman/9406287/delayed/quotes/nls/enph ENPH -0.97% will make the loans more appealing to conservative investors, Mosaic said.In the typical solar-lease agreement, homeowners are usually locked in to a decades-long contract but pay little or no money up front for a system on their roofs. Lease payments are usually smaller than monthly electricity bills, but homeowners often miss out on state and federal incentives by not buying a system outright.Solar-panel leases were popularized by privately held SunRun Inc. and SolarCity Corp. /quotes/zigman/13139813/delayed/quotes/nls/scty SCTY -5.54% .Mosaic in March launched a loan product in partnership with solar developer and installer Real Goods Solar Inc. /quotes/zigman/109405/delayed/quotes/nls/rgse RGSE 0.00%  SunPower Corp. /quotes/zigman/7312465/delayed/quotes/nls/spwr SPWR -3.82%  last month said it closed on a $200 million loan program to fund residential solar projects over the next two years. Homeowners interested in going solar would apply for a loan of up to $60,000 to cover installation costs.Meanwhile, shares of solar-power companies and renewable energy companies fell on Tuesday, tracking the broader U.S. equity market following records last week. Earnings season unofficially begins after the market closes Tuesday, with Alcoa Inc. reporting its second-quarter results.Among the hardest hit solar shares, U.S.-listed Jinko Solar Holding Co. /quotes/zigman/587434/delayed/quotes/nls/jks JKS -8.85%  declined 6.5%.

European stocks slump for third day after weak German data	By Sara Sjolin, MarketWatchThe Stoxx Europe 600 index /quotes/zigman/2380150/delayed XX:SXXP -1.40%  dropped 1.4% to close at 339.99, marking the biggest one-day point slide since early March.Germany’s DAX 30 index /quotes/zigman/2380246/delayed DX:DAX -1.35%  gave up 1.4% to 9,772.67, after trade data showed both exports and imports fell in Germany in May, creating further fears that Europe’s economic engine is cooling. Read: Is Germany leading the euro zone toward the no-growth cliff?The data followed a meager industrial-production report for May on Monday, a disappointing reading on manufacturing orders released on Friday and softer-than-forecast unemployment data also out last week — all raising red flags about Germany’s growth potential.Stephen Pope, managing partner at Spotlight Ideas, said in a note on Tuesday that a critical analysis of the German economy is necessary, as the overall GDP looks to the industrial sector for 28% of its value. With the recent weak data, the economy is on track to expand by only 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter, indicating a 0.4% annualized rate. That would be a “tremendous decline” from first quarter’s 3.3% annualized rate, Pope said.“If the number one [European] economy is running at anything less than full tilt, then the overall region will struggle to expand, and the ECB will face an enduring headache of disinflation leading to deflation,” he said. “Without a vibrant Germany, the 18-member euro zone will struggle to expand.”Elsewhere in Europe, France’s CAC 40 index /quotes/zigman/3173214/delayed FR:PX1 -1.44%  lost 1.4% to 4,342.53, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 index /quotes/zigman/3173262/delayed UK:UKX -1.25%  fell 1.3% to 6,738.45.Stocks in London were weighed by fresh data on U.K. factory output for May, which unexpectedly fell and showed a broad based decline. The news also hurt the pound /quotes/zigman/4867886/realtime/sampled GBPUSD +0.0136%  that fell to $1.7126 from as high as $1.7149 ahead of the data.Economists, however, didn’t seem to worry too much about the weakness. Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist, at Berenberg said the data were “unlikely to be a true reflection of what is happening in the sector” and that a big bounce-back in output is possible next month.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, also cautioned not to read too much into one month’s data and noted that the more stable three-month trend rate of growth in the official data remains historically strong at 1.1%, which is broadly in line with the PMI survey.Among notable movers, shares of Air France-KLM /quotes/zigman/127901/delayed FR:AF -8.72%  slumped 8.7% after the airline company lowered its 2014 earnings guidance due to weak demand and difficulties in repatriating revenue from Venezuela.Other airlines followed Air France-KLM lower, with shares of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA /quotes/zigman/3670411/delayed UK:IAG -7.00%   /quotes/zigman/3773940/delayed/quotes/nls/icagy ICAGY -7.14%  down 7% and Deutsche Lufthansa AG /quotes/zigman/184134/delayed DE:LHA -3.31%  off 3.8%.Commerzbank AG /quotes/zigman/15637094/delayed DE:CBK -5.05%  gave up 5.6% after reports that the German lender has begun settlement talks with U.S. regulators over its payment activities with Iran and other countries blacklisted by the U.S. A representative from Commerzbank wasn’t immediately available to comment.Also in Frankfurt, shares of Volkswagen AG /quotes/zigman/150411/delayed DE:VOW3 -1.97%  slipped 2% after the auto maker said sales of its namesake-branded cars in the first half of the year were weak in Europe and continued to slide in the U.S. and South America.Shares of A.P. Moeller-Maersk AS /quotes/zigman/217407/delayed DK:MAERSKB -1.40%  lost 1.4% after the Danish shipping and oil company said it would book a $1.7 billion impairment on its Brazilian assets as it changes strategy in the region.Obamacare faces another court threat — and this one could be fatalWhy trading volume is tumbling, explained in 5 chartsAre these the dumbest investing ideas you’ve ever heard?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5FE3CFCE-066E-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
S&P 500, Nasdaq retest major support	By Michael Ashbaugh, MarketWatchIn the process, each index is retesting significant technical support, and the response to these areas should be a useful bull-bear gauge. The charts below add color:Before detailing the U.S. markets wider view, the S&P 500’s hourly chart highlights the past two weeks.As illustrated, the S&P has pulled in from its latest all-time high.From current levels, initial support rests at the breakout point — the June peak of 1,968 — and is followed by a deeper floor around 1,950.Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ near-term backdrop is similar.In its case, initial support spans from 16,970 to the 17,000 mark, and is followed by the 20-day moving average (not illustrated), currently 16,885.And the Nasdaq Composite has reversed from 14-year highs.On further weakness, the top of the gap — Nasdaq 4,424 — marks first support, and is followed by a firmer floor at the 4,400 mark.Widening the view to six months adds perspective.On this wider view, the Nasdaq has staged a straightline break to 14-year highs.Its breakout point — spanning from the March peak of 4,371 to the 4,400 mark — now represents its first significant support, and the initial pullback to this area would be expected to draw buyers.Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has pulled in from record territory. Three inflection points stand out:Separately, the 50-day moving average (in blue) has marked a useful trending indicator since February, and is rising to meet the late-June low. The Dow’s intermediate-term trend points higher barring a violation of this area.And the S&P 500 topped last week at 1,985, within striking distance of the 2,000 mark.The S&P’s breakout point spans from 1,962 to 1,968 — matching its former closing and absolute all-time highs — and the first retest of this area should be a useful bull-bear gauge.The major U.S. stock benchmarks have pulled in from less-charted territory following a strong third-quarter start.But despite near-term cross currents, the bigger-picture technicals continue to support the bull case.Returning to the Nasdaq, the chart above includes the 20-day Bollinger bands.These bands, also known as volatility bands, bracket two standard deviations of the Nasdaq’s volatility across the prior 20 sessions.As illustrated, the Nasdaq started the third quarter with three consecutive closes above its 20-day bands. This is statistically unusual, and cuts two ways.For the near-term , the index is technically overbought and due to consolidate.But more importantly, the Nasdaq’s breakout has been directionally powerful — and statistically unusual — improving the chances of longer-term gains.Against this backdrop, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF /quotes/zigman/260873/delayed/quotes/nls/iwm IWM -1.21%  — a small-cap benchmark — has balked at major resistance.Consider that the IWM’s range top defines its all-time high, and the small-caps have initially drawn sellers in this area.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9E7ADE30-06B9-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Fourteen stocks for 2014 halftime report	By Kirk SpanoSunEdison /quotes/zigman/17430636/delayed/quotes/nls/sune SUNE -1.19% , which I first recommended in 2012 when it was called MEMC Electronics, is once again my leading holding with a return of 74% so far. In 2013, the solar company was the leading mid-cap stock on the Nasdaq, returning 306%. While skepticism remains from the investing public about solar, there is little doubt it is a leading growth industry and will remain so for years to come. When people like Warren Buffett get involved in the industry, you know there is something sustainable.SunEdison is not for the faint of heart and is not a textbook Buffett stock. It is a volatile momentum stock for now and subject to significant financial pressures, including a leveraged balance sheet. Tightening credit markets will likely cause a slowdown in business at some point which cuts growth. When that happens, there could be a quick and significant drop in its share price. Longer term however, any fallback in share price is a buying opportunity in my opinion.I trimmed holdings once this year in SunEdison to take gains, which in hindsight turned out to be a mistake. I have been selling puts repeatedly since selling those shares, however, I have seen those options expire all but one time. So far, I have not given up much in gains due to the option premium accrual, but that is unlikely to last if the stock keeps running. I am actively looking to expand my holdings in SunEdison, however, Mr. Market hasnt given me many reduced-risk opportunities. SunEdison is my fourth-largest holding at 4% to 8% of stock portfolios.“Fourteen Stocks for 2014” Halftime Report ChartOil, natural-gas, and oil and gas service stocks have been among my leaders, as well. I recommended all of the companies I am invested in throughout 2012 before most analysts started jumping on board last autumn and this year. In general, the run up in share prices is nearing the end of a valuation cycle. Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios are nearing frothy levels usually associated with a slowdown in stock-price appreciation.An eventual breather in the Middle East should be a catalyst to see many oil- and gas-related stocks do some retracing. While I like Chesapeake Energy, Whiting Petroleum, Triangle Petroleum, CJ Energy Services and Flotek Industries long-term, I have trimmed my holdings in all of those with the exception of Ches ap eake Energy /quotes/zigman/126832/delayed/quotes/nls/chk CHK +1.67%  Chesapeake is the rare undervalued-asset play that could reflect its true value someday, which I believe to be in excess of $60 per share. Usually, companies that have valuable assets which dont reflect in share price have some deep impairment that is never overcome. Chesapeake however, is in the early innings of a resurgence that has been led by Carl Icahns cleaning up of the balance sheet and a refocusing of its business.The rise in natural-gas prices to more historically normal levels and an increase in oil production are both positives for the company. This weeks spinoff of Seventy Seven Energy is another step in the right direction for Chesapeake, as that transaction further reduces its debt and is likely to fortify margins. The company is also a potential takeover target. Chesapeake is my third-largest holding at 6%-8% of stock portfolios.Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL -0.64%  is my second-largest holding at 8% to 10% of stock portfolios. I covered the company near its bottoming out last year and made a strong recommendation to buy the stock. What we are seeing now is the resurgence of a technology company that has a niche market in about 15% of the most well-off people on the planet. While some fret over Samsungs and Googles /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG -1.92%  larger market shares, I would challenge anybody to explain why having a dominant niche in more affluent customers is a bad thing.Very importantly, Apple is embarking on a huge new product cycle. It is introducing new iPhones with larger screens that are nearly unbreakable, new iPads and the breathlessly awaited iWatch. In addition, Apples acquisition of Beats, which comes with massive star power, is likely to go down as a coup.Over the next few years, we will see Apple entrench themselves in mobile and online payments, automobile technology and virtual-home controls. All of these things are already in motion and not speculation. The only question is what will be the most successful and profitable. I do not put it by Apple to establish high-end niches across the board.On Scutify, I gave Apple a price target of $1100 before the 7:1 split, equal to $157 split adjusted. I now think over the next three to seven years that will prove to be too low of an estimate. Like Chesapeake, Carl Icahn is involved with Apple — usually a good occurrence for share holders. Unlike Chesapeake, this time I got in just ahead of and at a lower price than Icahn. Apple is also a favorite of David Einhorn and several other billionaire investors.Because I know people will ask, my largest holding has become Ex a ct Sciences /quotes/zigman/85083/delayed/quotes/nls/exas EXAS -5.79%  at about 12% of stock portfolios. I have owned the company for six years in many accounts and have had quite the nice ride up. I am playing with house money at this point.Exact has imminent FDA and CMS catalysts. If the news is as I expect, Exacts upside is still tremendous, especially given the huge short interest. I am leveraged with calls at present, however, I also own out-of-the-money puts to hedge against something unexpected and catastrophic. Exact is a lesson in long-term patient investing, risk management (it is a speculative biotech), and ongoing research and analysis. Another not Buffett stock.I have recently added Barrick Gold /quotes/zigman/12772/delayed/quotes/nls/abx ABX +2.08%  again after trading it and believe from the middle teens it is a buy as an inflation hedge and a rebound play. I have had a position in Veolia Environment /quotes/zigman/323930/delayed/quotes/nls/ve VE -2.97%  since 2011 and added to it early this year. I believe both companies have the potential to reach previous highs sometime during this decade.The laggards in the portfolio this year have been financial companies. While AIG /quotes/zigman/557836/delayed/quotes/nls/aig AIG -0.69%  is up 7.42% I am no longer invested in it since selling out at about breakeven in order to add to companies with stronger up trends. I am also out of Citigroup /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C -1.17%  and Global Cash Access /quotes/zigman/373665/delayed/quotes/nls/gca GCA -1.35% , taking small losses on both. I am looking for opportunities to get back into AIG and Citigroup. I have eliminated Global Cash Access from my universe as it is retrenching its business after some contract disappointments and does not appear to have the asymmetric upside I believed it did.I am also out of Lab Corp /quotes/zigman/258903/delayed/quotes/nls/lh LH -0.98%  and Quest Diagnostics /quotes/zigman/171542/delayed/quotes/nls/dgx DGX -0.30%  as neither offers the type of upside I am looking for despite being good companies. This is a lesson I think all investors need to continually remind themselves of. While there are plenty of good companies out there, not many offer the type of reward for the risk found in most equities.Of note, I am holding about 12% of most stock accounts in cash currently. I typically carry 4% to 20% cash to be used during market pullbacks.Disclosure: Kirk and certain clients of Bluemound Asset Management are long Apple, Barrick Gold, Chesapeake Energy, CJ Energy Services, Exact Sciences, Flotek Industries, SunEdison, Triangle Petroleum, Veolia and Whiting Petroleum.

U.S. moves closer to sanctions settlement with Commerzbank	By Andrew R. Johnson and Andrew GrossmanA settlement could cost the bank at least $500 million and be completed this summer, though a deal isn’t definite, according to these people.Authorities investigating Commerzbank /quotes/zigman/15637094/delayed DE:CBK -5.05%   include the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Reserve, New York’s Department of Financial Services and the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, the people said.The German lender has said in regulatory filings in recent years that it faces an investigation by U.S. authorities over transactions involving sanctioned countries, including Iran and Cuba.The possible deal would follow a settlement between BNP Paribas SA /quotes/zigman/132292/delayed FR:BNP -2.13%   and U.S. authorities in which the French bank agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges related to sanctions violations and pay $8.97 billion--a record for a sanctions case.In this case, however, Commerzbank is viewed as more likely to agree to a deferred prosecution agreement rather than agreeing to a guilty plea as BNP did.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Say hello to the U.S. economy’s latest bubbleDow 17,000 is on the wrong side of history6 companies that should report huge earnings gains	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=527AAF1A-06B4-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Natural-gas prices at six-month low; oil seesaws	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchOil futures traded mostly lower with Libya expected to soon ramp up oil exports and no sign of production disruptions in Iraq.August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 0.00%  fell nearly 7 cents, or 1.6%, to $4.16 per million British thermal units. Tracking the most-active contracts, prices haven’t closed at a level this low since Jan. 10. Prices tumbled more than 4% on Monday.Below-normal temperatures across the upper-Midwest next week are “spreading like an inkblot towards the coasts on the 8-14 day outlook,” said Matt Schneider, a commodity analyst at Schneider Electric, in a note. “This points towards further decimation of the [supply] deficits in the coming weeks in terms of storage, hence natural gas is back at the bottom of this year’s range, testing six-month lows.”Meanwhile, crude futures continue to give back the premium built in after fighting between Sunni insurgents and the Iraqi government broke out in June. Oil had jumped to nine-month highs on fears the violence could disrupt Iraq’s 2.5 million barrel-a-day export flow. Those concerns have faded on expectations Iraq’s key southern oil fields and facilities will remain insulated from the turmoil.August crude /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 +0.15%  fell 18 cents, or 0.2%, to $103.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 0.00%  lost 62 cents, or 0.6%, to $109.62 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.The expected and long-delayed return of two Libyan oil ports is also expected to maintain pressure on oil prices.On Nymex, petroleum products traded lower as well, with August gasoline /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 -0.24%  at $2.98 a gallon, down a penny and August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821453/delayed HOQ4 -0.35%  down nearly 2 cents at $2.90 a gallon.The U.S. market awaits the usual weekly reports on petroleum supplies, due late Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute and early Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration.Analysts polled by Platts are looking for a decline of 3 million barrels in crude supplies, a fall of 1 million barrels in gasoline stockpiles and an increase of 1.2 million barrels for distillates, which include heating oil.7 market myths that make investors poorerBuying a brewer isn’t the only way to play the spaceWhy trading volume is tumbling, explained in 5 charts	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=BC3B067A-0696-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

6 companies that should report huge earnings gains	By Philip van Doorn, MarketWatchBut looking beyond the weather will be of more interest, because many companies that suffered the worst earnings declines in the first quarter are also expected to show huge year-over-year earnings growth for the second quarter.To highlight those, we began with the S&P 1500 Composite Index, which includes the components of the S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX -0.70% , the S&P MidCap 400 /quotes/zigman/6015543/realtime MID -0.74%  and the S&P SmallCap 600 /quotes/zigman/3870020/realtime SML -0.93% . In order to show which companies posted the worst earnings decreases during the first quarter, we limited the list to stocks with positive earnings per share for both periods.So here are the 10 profitable S&P 1500 companies showing the worst year-over-year EPS declines for the first quarter:Investors might have expected to see a list of retailers, because shoppers stayed at home during the frigid temperatures. But the list is varied, in part, because we focused on EPS. Many of these companies reported lousy results that had nothing to do with the weather.Here’s where it gets interesting: Seven of those stocks are expected to show year-over-year EPS growth for the second quarter, based on consensus estimates among analysts polled by FactSet. Six may report double-digit increases in EPS:Here’s more on all 10 companies, beginning with the ones showing the largest year-over-year EPS declines for the most recently reported quarter:Prologis EPS Comparison at FindTheBestPrologis Inc. /quotes/zigman/5338164/delayed/quotes/nls/pld PLD -0.02%  of San Francisco is a real estate investment trust that acquires, develops and leases industrial distribution and retail properties worldwide. The stock has returned 13% this year through Monday’s close at $41.12. The shares have a dividend yield of 3.21%.The company saw a 98% decline in reported earnings per share for the first quarter, to 1 cent. However, core funds from operations (FFO) increased to 43 cents from 40 cents a year earlier, and more than covered the dividend.Equity REITs — that is, those that invest in commercial properties — report FFO because it excludes gains and losses from property sales and depreciation, and provides a better measurement of how well earnings cover dividends.Analysts polled by FactSet expect Prologis to report a second-quarter profit of 9 cents a share, improving from a net loss of 3 cents in the second quarter of 2013. The consensus FFO estimate for the second quarter is 46 cents, compared with 41 cents a year earlier.Greenhill EPS Comparison at FindTheBestGreenhill & Co. /quotes/zigman/343735/delayed/quotes/nls/ghl GHL -3.77%  is an investment bank headquartered in New York. The stock is down 17% this year through Monday’s close at $47.01. The shares have a yield of 3.83%.First-quarter EPS was down 98% to 1 cent, as Greenhill reported a 45% drop in revenue to $43.6 million. The company lost $4.9 million on its “remaining significant” principal investment.Greenhill chairman Robert F. Greenhill on April 23, in a statement, said: “In the year to date, we have seen a substantial increase in client activity, such that we expect a strong rebound in revenue and the achievement for the full year of metrics relating to revenue productivity, profitability and return of capital to shareholders consistent with our historic performance.”For the second quarter, analysts expect EPS to come in at 46 cents, down from 52 cents during the second quarter of 2013.EPS comparison at FindTheBestNext is Impax Laboratories Inc. /quotes/zigman/81476/delayed/quotes/nls/ipxl IPXL -1.64%  of Hayward, Calif., which makes and distributes generic prescription drugs, and also branded proprietary medications for treating central nervous system disorders. The stock has returned 16% this year through Monday’s close at $29.28.First-quarter EPS fell 94% to 9 cents. However, if one-time tax prepayments of $150 million were excluded, adjusted EPS declined to 24 cents from 37 cents a year earlier.Revenue fell 20% to $118.7 million, mainly because the first-quarter results reflected the loss of patent exclusivity for the company’s Zomig tablet and disintegrating tablet products in May 2013.Analysts expect the company to report second-quarter EPS of 37 cents, up from 8 cents a year earlier.Boise Cascade EPS Comparison at FindTheBestBoise Cascade Co. /quotes/zigman/14039935/delayed/quotes/nls/bcc BCC -1.98%  of Boise, Idaho, makes and distributes wood construction materials in the United States and Canada. The stock is down 7% this year through Monday’s close at $27.31.The company’s first-quarter EPS tumbled 93% to 14 cents, mainly because the year-earlier period included a $68.7 million tax benefit springing from the company’s earlier conversion from a limited liability corporation in February 2013. Sales were up 3% from a year earlier to $767.2 million.Analysts expect Boise Cascade to report second-quarter EPS of 36 cents, up 52% from a year earlier.Cambrex EPS Comparison at FindTheBestCambrex Corp. /quotes/zigman/221230/delayed/quotes/nls/cbm CBM -0.75%  of East Rutherford, N.J., makes chemicals used as ingredients for pharmaceutical products. The stock has returned 19% this year through Monday’s close at $21.25.First-quarter EPS declined 92% to 3 cents, as sales dropped 11% to $66.2 million.“While the timing of orders created a slow start to 2014, we expect strong growth in the second quarter to result in first-half growth in both sales and EBITDA compared to the first half of last year,” Cambrex CEO Steven Klosk said in a statement May 2. He also expressed confidence the company would show operating earnings growth for 2014, “similar to the increases we have delivered over the last three years.”Analysts expect Cambrex to report second-quarter EPS of 28 cents, compared with 7 cents a year earlier.Please see the next page for five more companies that will report big profit gains.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F9DD9714-05F0-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

El-Erian: Liquidity may be most mispriced market risk	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- The waning ability to buy and sell securities in the market is one of the most important risks facing investors, according to Mohamed El-Erian. In an interview on CNBC Tuesday, the former Pimco chief executive said he believes it will become more difficult to find dealers and other intermediators to buy and sell investments as investment banks reduce the inventory of securities they use to make markets. Liquidity is probably the most mispriced risk right now in the market, said El-Erian. He also discussed the outlook on monetary policy, saying that, the market is very comforted by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellens commitment to using macroprudential policies to curb financial excesses.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=99F610C6-CD16-48A2-B267-21091AE965B2&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Groupon shares rally premarket after B. Riley upgrade	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Shares of Groupon /quotes/zigman/7212269/delayed/quotes/nls/grpn GRPN -2.64% rallied 5.7% in premarket trade after B.

At today’s level, the Dow industrials /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA -0.69%  are up 5% since the beginning of this year. This is on top of a 35% leap in 2013. And in case you are keeping score, the Dow is now a whopping 155% above its low back in March 2009.All that said, there are a number of warning signs out there that suggest the party may soon be over.For one thing the economy has not grown anywhere near as much as stocks over the past 5-1/3 years; neither have corporate profits.Additionally, price-to-earnings ratios are well above average. Robert Shiller, the noted Yale professor, economist and author, thinks that the market today is about at the valuation it was running at in 2008, just before stocks plunged.In the past, the stock market has managed to avoid such excesses by dropping in price. A decline of 10% (a.k.a. a correction) used to occur about once every 12 months.This bull market has managed to avoid a correction for 33 months — far longer than average. And correction or no, the current bull market is the fourth-longest since the Crash of 1929.If you don’t have angst yet, here is another bit of history to chew on: Stocks usually take a header late in the third quarter, as well as in October. Indeed, some of the market’s biggest declines have occurred during this period.Here is another tidbit: Bond prices are up — the yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +0.39% , at 2.61% Monday night, is down from over 3% at the end of last year. This suggests that bond buyers are concerned about the longevity of the economic recovery.In the face of all these warning signs, the stock market continues to work its way higher. Stocks are being supported by a lack of alternatives to low-interest bonds and bills.The Federal Reserve is keeping rates low in order to support the economy. In the process, it is inflating stock prices, thus creating a bubble.So let me ask you, what do you think will happen to stocks when the Fed decides to take away the punch bowl and raise rates?I don’t know, but if I were you, I would not walk under any open windows down on Wall Street.Hulbert: Gold might be up this year, but it’s worth only $800Beijing cuts Tesla out of charger-station planChina-U.S. business debate: WaPo vs. People’s Daily	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7F003B14-0659-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
AbbVie raises offer for Shire	By Ian WalkerThe U.S. company said its cash and shares offer represented GBP51.15 a share ($87.6), an 11% rise on its previous offer.If they accept the offer Shire /quotes/zigman/66975/delayed/quotes/nls/shpg SHPG -1.92%   shareholders would get GBP22.44 in cash and 0.8568 of an ordinary AbbVie share for each Shire share they own.AbbVie /quotes/zigman/13067932/delayed/quotes/nls/abbv ABBV -2.98%  said the new offer “reflects a substantial sharing of potential synergies between the shareholders of each company,” adding that it strongly encourages shareholders to consider the proposal and communicate their perspective to Shire’s board.Shire, which specializes in drugs to treat attention-deficit disorder and rare diseases, rejected a $46 billion takeover offer from AbbVie last month, saying it undervalued the company’s growth prospects.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Why Dow 17,000 is on the wrong side of historyTrading strategies July: All about beerThe M&A boom is going to end badly	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CE3F5E0E-0699-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
5 states with the most (and fewest) foreclosures	By Quentin Fottrell, MarketWatchThere were 47,000 completed foreclosures nationally in May, down from 52,000 a year ago, which is a drop of 9.4%. But if you look at the month-over-month numbers from just April to May, completed foreclosures were up by 3.8%, according to mortgage-data firm CoreLogic. This is still more than double the amount of foreclosures that typically took place before the housing market crash in 2007: Completed foreclosures averaged 21,000 per month nationwide between 2000 and 2006.Completed foreclosures reflect the actual number of homes lost to foreclosure. Since the financial crisis began in September 2008, there have been around 5 million completed foreclosures in the U.S. In May, roughly 660,000 homes were still in some stage of foreclosure, down from 1 million in May 2013, a decline of 37%. The foreclosure inventory as of May 2014 represented 1.7% of all homes with a mortgage, compared with 2.6% in May 2013.Foreclosures may also weigh on house prices in areas where they’re more common, experts say, and there’s still wide disparity between the foreclosure inventories in states. The five states with the highest foreclosure inventory in May were New Jersey (5.8% of all mortgaged homes), Florida (5.2%), New York (4.3%), Hawaii (3.1%) and Maine (2.8%). The five states with the lowest foreclosure inventory were Alaska (0.3%), Nebraska (0.4%), North Dakota (0.4%), Wyoming (0.4%) and Minnesota (0.5%).New York — along with Florida, Hawaii, New Jersey, Maine and 17 other states — is a judicial foreclosure state, which means foreclosures must go through the court system. In non-judicial foreclosure states, the lender might only notify the owners that they are in default before putting their home up for auction. North Dakota, which has one of the lowest foreclosure rates, is also a judicial foreclosure state, but it has a much lower housing inventory than states like Florida, and its real estate market has also benefited from the oil boom.New York is split into three different markets, says Steven Domber, broker and owner of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Hudson Valley Properties in Hopewell Junction, N.Y. “New York City is one of the better markets in the country right now,” he says. “There’s also job growth in upstate New York. The Hudson Valley is not gaining jobs or losing jobs. The closer to the city, the healthier the markets are.” But the lengthy judicial process can make a state look unhealthier than it is, he adds.The real estate market is working through the final foreclosures, which also provide an opportunity for investors and first-time buyers who are willing to do some extensive renovations, experts say. And although many of these bank-owned homes are in need of repair and not in the best neighborhoods, they will still help boost inventory in those markets. The five states with the highest number of completed foreclosures for the 12 months ending in May were Florida (122,000), Michigan (44,000), Texas (39,000), California (34,000) and Georgia (32,000) and accounted for almost half of all completed foreclosures nationally. The lowest were the District of Columbia (71), North Dakota (334), West Virginia (515), Wyoming (710) and Alaska (856).Other articles by Quentin Fottrell:Why your rent is so damn highShould you move to Detroit10 markets where home sales are falling5 cities with the happiest workers	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E112A5C8-0639-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Small-business optimism index drops in June: NFIB	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Small-business optimism dropped in June on a big decline in those who expect the economy to improve, according to a survey released Tuesday. The National Federation of Independent Business said its small-business optimism index fell 1.6 points to 95, as six of 10 components fell and only two rose. Those who expect the economy to improve dropped 10 points to a net negative 10 reading, by far the biggest shift. The two jobs components (those that plan to increase employment and current job openings) both rose on the month.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E7E41DDF-FDFA-4EA1-8E95-8AEC61D838FE&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Car salesmen aren’t as sleazy as you think	By Catey Hill, MarketWatchAccording to the second annual TrueCar Buyer Study, which surveyed more than 3,000 people, consumers think car dealers are raking in the dough -- at their expense. The average car buyer believes that car dealers make about a 20% profit on the sale of a $30,000 car, but believe that a 10% to 12% profit is actually fair. What’s more, more than one in four car buyers feel they overpaid for their new car and nearly one in three would not return to the same dealership because of the shoddy customer service. “There is a trust gap between the auto industry and consumers,” says Scott Painter, the CEO of TrueCar.com, who notes that this year’s survey results were roughly the same as last year’s.But the reality of the situation is different. The average pretax profit margins for car dealerships was just 2.2% last year, down from 2.3% a year prior, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association 2013 report -- and this year, that pretax profit margin is expected to remain at just 2.2% . And the net profit that dealers earned last year from each new vehicle was just $69 for new cars and $254 per used vehicle (OK, so maybe used car salesmen are a little sleazier) -- not exactly the thousands of dollars many of us imagine and lower than the net profits dealers realized just a decade ago. “There’s been a pinch in profit margins,” says Brandon Ruiz, a lead analyst with IBISWorld. “They’re low compared to pre-recession levels.”Part of the reason is that consumers are beating dealers at their own game. “A lot of people are now doing that [car-buying] research upfront from the comfort of their homes,” says Seth Berkowitz, the president of Edmunds.com . Thanks in part to price-competitive online retailers, consumers “think the pricing should be aggressive because that’s how they’ve been trained,” he adds -- and that means the salesman has a lot less leeway in what he charges consumers.When shopping for a used car, Justin Sisley, a former sales and leasing consultant for a dealership in Madison, Wis. and the author of “Time to Lease,” says many consumers know to go on Cars.com or AutoTrader.com and look at the prices of similar used cars within a 100-to-150-mile radius; they bring this information into the dealer for comparison purposes. And he says that more consumers shopping for a new car come to the dealer armed with the invoice price of the car (that’s what the manufacturer paid for the car), which they find for free on sites like Edmunds.com .To be sure, these reduced profit margins aren’t all because consumers have gotten savvier (though this certainly plays a large role), says Ruiz. He adds that the squeezed profit margins are also due to consumers wanting better fuel economy cars, which tend to be smaller and cheaper and sometimes have lower profit margins than souped-up SUVs, for example. What’s more car manufacturers are increasingly rewarding dealers based on sales volume, which makes dealers more likely to sell cars at cheaper prices so they can sell more of them.Still, just because you can score a great deal on the car itself, doesn’t mean the dealers aren’t boosting their income in other ways. Jason Lancaster, the founder of AccurateAutoAdvice.com who has a decade of experience in sales and management of car dealerships, says that some of the dealers’ profit comes from the financing and extras they sell consumers. For example, he says that a dealer may quote you an auto-loan interest rate that’s well above what they’re getting from the bank and pocket the difference; to combat that, look up auto loan rates before you even enter the dealership.He adds that the extras dealers try to sell you when you’re in the office signing papers (things like corrosion protection, paint sealant and fabric protection) are often overpriced. When you’re in the office going through each item, make a note of the ones you need and then call around to see if you can get them for less elsewhere, he advises. Note that you do not need most of the items they offer. For example, an extended warranty on a car with a good reputation usually isn’t necessary, according to a 2013 Consumer Reports survey , nor do you likely need fabric protection (buy Scotchgard and do it yourself if your family is really messy) or paint protection (the car’s finish is designed to last as it is).Ruiz says that new-car dealerships generate about 15% of their revenue from the service-and-parts department -- and consumers can negotiate deals here, too. While dealers don’t tend to negotiate a lot for smaller jobs, Lancaster says that you can sometimes get 10% to 20% off with jobs that will take six hours or more of labor. He says that dealerships also sometimes mark up the prices of parts to above what the manufacturer suggests, so you should search online to find the price of the part, and order it yourself if need be. Also, consider going somewhere other than the dealership for repairs, and use the RepairPal app to learn what repairs in your area should cost.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=44CB2182-0638-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Is your mechanic overcharging you?	By Christine DiGangi, Credit.comThat being said, research is time-consuming, and not all information is good or accurate. Still, when your financial stability is on the line, it’s worth the time to make sure you’re not getting ripped off.Know what you’re paying forCar repairs are a good example of this. First of all, many people who haven’t had work done on their vehicles don’t know you have to pay not only for the parts that are being replaced but the hours that go into fixing the car. Don’t forget to ask for quotes on parts and labor when choosing an auto repair shop.On top of that, you can use online estimating tools and call local repair shops and ask for price quotes--anything you can get in writing will be helpful, in case your bill ends up being much higher than you expected. With a little research, you can go over expectations with your mechanic. If you’re billed for five hours of work on something you’re certain should have taken two, it’s worth having something to back up your claims and try to work out the discrepancy.The real cost of auto repairsOther than making sure you get your money’s worth, it’s a good idea to research repair estimates so you don’t end up having to drain your savings or go into debt over unexpected expenses. Sudden auto-repair needs qualify as emergency expenses--you should tap your rainy-day fund only for real emergencies, which takes more self-control than you may expect--but you should still use as little savings as possible in these situations.Dipping into your emergency fund means you’ll need to aggressively rebuild the account, and the more you have to replace, the more challenging that will be. Failure to have sufficient savings or replenishing spent funds is a common path to debt, which, if not managed properly, can grow. A sudden car repair may be the difference between paying off your credit card every month and needing to carry a balance, or perhaps you find yourself needing to take out a personal loan to cover expenses.If you find yourself in that situation, pay close attention to your credit before, during and after you take on the debt so you’re aware of its repercussions and you can make sure you address any negative effects, like  late payments or high debt levels, as soon as possible. Even if you’re not in the midst of dealing with emergency expenses, you should regularly monitor your credit scores and the information that dictates them, which you can do using free tools like those available through Credit.com . In the event that your car has been damaged beyond repair, you’ll want to make sure your credit is in good shape: A poor credit history may make it difficult to get approved for an auto loan, and if you are approved, you could be facing much higher interest rates than someone who has excellent credit. In an emergency, you don’t want to have to wonder about your credit score, which is why it helps to make credit monitoring a habit.More From Credit.com:The Ultimate Guide to Credit ScoresWhat’s a Good Credit Score?   How Credit Impacts Your Day-to-Day Life	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CA2C71D6-019D-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
This device promises aging baby boomers injury-free exercise	By Therese Poletti, MarketWatchLEO is a band worn around the thigh, with specially designed sensors that measure the body’s myriad bio-signals. And that makes LEO different from devices that you wear on your wrist, including the current batch of smartwatches and even new ones on deck..“You can’t collect muscle info on the wrist,” said Leonard MacEachern, president and CEO of GestureLogic Inc., the Ottawa, Canada-based startup behind LEO. “It truly is next generation because the current generation doesn’t really measure bio-signals.”Currently, its software is designed for running, walking and biking. For example, LEO can tell that your muscles need hydration, gauge lactic acid levels, or warn you if are coming down too hard on your heels. But the company expects software developers to create new ways to use LEO in other athletic activities.Its software provides feedback on a simple keypad, and gives actionable warnings, such as “muscle imbalance detected, push harder with your left leg.” And once LEO gathers more data on your activities, it can make conclusions or predictions.Currently LEO is in beta testing and GestureLogic is raising additional funding via an Indiegogo campaign, Contributors will be able to buy a LEO at a discount. GestureLogic is aiming for the device to be available in April of 2015.The range of technological expertise needed to work in this emerging arena is extremely wide, MacEachern said, adding that Gesture Logic has enlisted software developers, textile software engineers, programmers, machine-intelligence experts and electrical engineers. The company has angel investors but will be looking for Series A funding, he added.My ongoing concern is about the data collection aspect of wearable devices, especially those gathering health data. But like many people, I might be willing to make some trade-offs if using a device like LEO could really help avoid injuries while working out. That’s what GestureLogic and its peers are counting on, especially among the aging boomers.Indeed, now that Google Inc. /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG -1.92% and Apple Inc. /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL -0.64%  are establishing software guidelines for health apps and wearable devices, be prepared for a flood of wearable startups.

Getting out of debt saved our marriage	By Credit.comHer husband Bob had been divorced and had two children. When his first marriage dissolved, he took on most of the debt he and his first wife had incurred. Ellie, on the other hand, had no debt and some money in the bank.“It was really devastating when I realized how bad off it was financially,” she says. “Plus I felt a sense of betrayal that I didn’t know how much consumer debt he had.”Then Bob took a $50,000 pay cut when he left his job in aerospace engineering to join the military full time. Ellie became pregnant right away and between children and the frequent moves required by Bob’s military service, she gave up her job in financial services. “We had five children in seven years and we moved 11 times in 13 years,” she says.The result of all these financial pressures was that there were weeks when they didn’t have enough money for groceries.Debt could have easily destroyed their marriage, says Kay. But instead it pulled them together. “He was tired of being in debt and he was tired of the lack of freedom because of the debt load he was carrying,” she says. “He was ready for a change. So we came together and said we would do whatever we needed to get out of debt.”Joining forces to get out of debtThe first things they did was create a budget. It was tight. One-third of their income went toward taxes, one-third toward child support and 10% was tithed. They had to live on the rest, as well as use it to chip away at the debt.The second thing they did was to make a commitment that any extra money that came in would go toward paying off debt. Their first tax refund? It went toward debt. The $50 birthday gift from grandma? Same thing.Ellie even went on The Price Is Right game show, where she won a camper. Though the Kays wanted to use it, they never did. Instead they sold it and used the money to pay off more debt.The third thing they did was to set up regular meetings (which she now calls the “Sixty Minute Money Workout”) where they talked about their finances for an hour. She explained the concept in an email:This saved us from barking back and forth about money matters because we could table the topic until our Money Monday night where we would set the timer for an hour and discuss the matter. Our ground rules for the workout included: no condescending attitudes, no arguing, no throwing food and no accusations. We worked on our debt for an hour, then stopped.Their efforts paid off and 2½ years later they were debt free. In addition, their journey opened a whole career path for Ellie, who became an author, speaker and writer who has written 14 books. Her latest is “Lean Body, Fat Wallet” (HarperCollins, 2014). She now tells her audiences, “Your point of challenge may one day be your point of strength.”Ellie also proudly notes that she and her husband have very high credit scores , in the top 2% of consumers nationwide. And while she doesn’t regret a thing, she says if she were getting married today she’d want to see a copy of his credit reports, “just like I would advise my millennial kids.”You can get your credit reports free once a year  and you can check and monitor your credit scores free at Credit.com.Ellie now spends her time helping others find ways to overcome their financial struggles. “When you look at how we dug out of debt in 2½ years it bordered on the miraculous,” she says. Not everyone will have the same results, of course. “We can’t promise miracles. But we can promise if you set up a budget and make a commitment (to pay off debt), it will whittle down.”This article originally appeared on Credit.com.More From Credit.com:How to Pay Off Credit Card Debt Understanding Your Debt Collection Rights  The Best Way to Loan Money to Friends & Family  	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C56EDA5A-019B-11E4-A0F2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Yikes! Did she give me a senior discount?	Surely, you will say to yourself, I don’t look that old.I’m a mere 59 and 19-months-old and it’s happened to me twice. The first time was at my local supermarket. I didn’t know whether to be happy or horrified. And on top of that, I had saved all of 77 cents.So I figured the senior discount was a fluke, an innocent mistake on the part of a young, obviously confused cashier. I took my bag of groceries and went back into denial.Then it happened again.This time was at a fast-food chain. After ringing up my burger, the cashier rethought the matter and suddenly lowered the price. Had she taken a liking to me? Were they having a special?No, when I checked my receipt, I found a 10% discount and the dreaded word “SENIOR.” This latest jab to my ego had been worth all of 32 cents.I suppose that one’s first senior discount is just another rite of passage, like your first date, job or colonoscopy. But I had always assumed that when the day finally came, I’d have to demand my rights, produce indisputable proof of my age and still face disbelief on the part of the cashier. I might even have to ask to see the store manager.I pictured this happening somewhere around age 85.But no, it was too late for that. I had already been accorded senior status by two sales clerks and it could happen again any time I visited another store or restaurant. I was beginning to see why some people shop entirely online.Senior discounts in declineTo add injury to insult, I am becoming a “senior” at a time when senior discounts are often paltry and increasingly rare. It’s one thing to get a little break on a sandwich, but nobody’s going to give us one on a Subaru.Joan Rattner Heilman remembers a different time, a sort of golden age for golden-agers.

9 things you need to know about 401(k) fees	But they and you should. That’s because paying high fees for your 401(k) likely reduces your overall investment returns, and ultimately the overall size of your nest egg. “Participants need to know the importance of fees on their returns,” says Erik Carter, a senior resident financial planner with Financial Finesse, in El Segundo, Calif.“Understanding how much you are paying in fees is a critical step to financial security,” agreed Laurie Rowley, the co-founder of the National Association of Retirement Plan Participants in San Francisco.So, what should you know about 401(k) fees and expenses?First, this: The Labor Department’s so-called 401(k) fee disclosure rule went into effect two years ago, in July 2012. (Happy anniversary, 401(k) fee-disclosure rule!) Under that rule, plan administrators are required to mail you a quarterly statement showing your investments’ rates of returns, investment-related fees, and expenses, including any amounts the plan deducted from your account to cover administrative expenses.Don’t feel alone, by the way, if you don’t know how much you’re paying for your 401(k) investments and plan, or if you didn’t make any changes in response to learning how much you were paying.Only half of plan participants even noticed that their fee information was disclosed, and just 7% took any action in response to learning how much they were paying in 401(k) fees, according to the 2013 Retirement Confidence Survey. Of the 7% who took action, one-third moved their money out of expensive investments; 23% withdrew from the plan; and 8% increased the share they invested in less expensive investments.“Millions of working Americans have no idea how much they are paying,” said Rowley. “One of the primary reasons for this is because the process of trying to figure out how much you are paying in fees is a difficult and confusing task.”According to Rowley, plan participants shouldn’t need a “secret decoder ring” to figure out how much they are paying for their retirement plan. But many do, and here it is.As classified by the Labor Department, 401(k) fees fall into three categories: plan administration fees; investment fees; and individual service fees. (For further information, read the Labor Department’s “ A Look At 401(k) Plan Fees. ”)Plan administration fees. The day-to-day operation of a 401(k) plan involves expenses for basic administrative services--such as plan record keeping, accounting, legal and trustee services.In some cases, these plan-administration expenses are covered by investment fees deducted from investment returns. In other cases, these fees are a separate charge borne by the employer or charged directly against the assets of the plan.When charged directly, the fees are allocated among the plan participants, where those with larger accounts pay more and those with small accounts pay less.Most 401(k) plan operating expenses (and those for 403(b) and 457 plans as well) are paid from plan assets, said Wayne Bogosian, president of PFE Advisors, in Southborough, Mass. “Said another way, paid by participants,” he said.And what’s important to note, Bogosian said, is that these investment-related expenses are not disclosed on the annual fee-disclosure notice because they are paid out of the revenue share paid to the record-keeper from some or all of the plan’s funds.So, at a minimum, plan participants should not be lulled into thinking that all they are paying for their 401(k) is plan administration fees. “Most people see administrative fees because they’re right on the statement, and many think that a $30 annual fee is all that they’re paying,” says Carter.Also note: Fees pay for services, so make sure you’re getting what you pay for. Check, for instance, to see whether your plan is paying for financial advice and you are not using it.Investment fees. By far the largest component of 401(k) plan fees and expenses are those associated with managing plan investments, says the Labor Department. Fees for investment management and other investment-related services generally are assessed as a percentage of assets invested.Advisers say that investment fees must not be overlooked. “The (401(k) fee) with the biggest impact is the mutual fund management and marketing fees or the expense ratio but it’s typically buried in the prospectus and it looks like a small percentage,” says Carter. “People don’t notice it but it eats away at your return over time like a river wearing away rock to create a valley.”Individual service fees. In addition to overall administrative expenses, there may be individual service fees associated with optional features offered under a 401(k) plan. One example: Fees associated with a 401(k) loan.Now here’s where it gets even more complicated, according to Brooks Herman, the head of BrightScope in San Diego. How plan disclose fees can vary from a very short summary to dozens of pages of disclosure documents, he said.“This part could be a little painful to figure out, but it is absolutely critical to your future financial future, so well worth the effort,” says Rowley. “You have to do a little homework here to figure out the fees.”	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=FCAFC018-0625-11E4-91DE-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Shaolin monks to create kung fu mobile app	By Laura He, MarketWatchShaolin Temple, reputedly the birthplace of both Zen Buddhism and kung fu, is going to develop its first motion-sensing mobile game in a bid to teach the traditional Shaolin fighting style to an audience of smartphone-carrying aficionados.Shi Yanlu, one of China’s most famous living martial artist and head coach of Shaolin Warrior Monk Team, led a group of acolytes to the first-ever “Chinese urban economy and e-commerce summit,” held by e-commerce giant Alibaba in the eastern city of Hangzhou.Their goal: to learn the Internet and digital technologies, so as to pave the way for the thousand-year-old temple to develop an educational martial-arts mobile game, according to a 21st Century Business Herald report on Monday.Shaolin Temple, located on Mount Song in China’s Henan province, attracts a great number of kung fu enthusiasts from all over the world, hoping to learn from the monastery’s masters. Its fame has led to a boom in private kung fu schools in neighboring areas, where more than 70,000 students are trained each year, according to an earlier report by the state-run People’s Daily.However, once the motion-sensing game launches, fans far from Mount Song can learn directly from the Shaolin monks how to use various weapons featured in Shaolin kung fu, including sword, stick and knife techniques, according to Lin Xiaosong, whose Tiandizhizhng Web Development company handles brand management for the Shaolin Temple.That’s right: Shaolin Temple has a brand-management firm.Actually, it’s not the first time the Shaolin Temple has ventured into technology. In March, the temple’s Venerable Master Abbot Shi Yongxin visited the California headquarters of Google Inc. /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG -1.92%   /quotes/zigman/93888/delayed/quotes/nls/googl GOOGL -2.09%  and Apple Inc. /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL -0.64%  , the official Xinhua News Agency reported at the time.

Molson Coors may have hit its limit	By Michael KahnLet’s start with the big picture. The beer industry has undergone a lot of consolidation over the past few years. Unfortunately, there is not a good index covering it, so we have to focus more on individual names. The only observation I can make is that many brewer stocks struggled in the middle to end of the last decade, but in 2012 the bull took over in a big way.Zeroing in on Molson Coors /quotes/zigman/363510/delayed/quotes/nls/tap TAP -0.26% , we can see that pattern on the chart below. The stock peaked in 2007 and bottomed in 2009, in tune with the broad market, but the similarities ended in late 2009. The stock moved more or less sideways with a coiling pattern centered near 45.As the broad market began the bull market that continues today in November 2012, so, too, did Molson Coors. It moved above 45 in March 2013 and it has not looked back since. And in February of this year, it finally started to outperform the market, something it had not done in six years.Since breaking out last year, the stock climbed above the 75 level before easing. That is a 67% gain, and for a company that makes beverages, not 3-D printers or electric cars, that is huge.The trend is clearly to the upside, but the question is whether it will continue. For me, the first thing I want to know is if momentum is easing back. Just as with a ball thrown in the air which slows down thanks to gravity, it can continue higher even as its speed decreases. Eventually, gravity will win, and right now, I see “gravity” starting to build around Molson Coors in the form of a declining relative strength index (RSI) indicator as seen in the chart below.Its higher high in price and lower high in RSI is called a divergence, and it sounds a warning. However, only a price reversal will turn it into a sell signal. Divergences sometimes resolve as prices pick up again, so we have to wait for the market to confirm it is done rising.Next, I see a weakening condition using Bollinger Bands, which are available on most free charting websites. Based on volatility, the bands provide an envelope for trading action, but contrary to many other similar analyses, touching the upper band is a positive, not negative sign.Moving above the bands is also a sign of strength. However, if the rally continues and the stock makes a higher high, but back within the bands, then we get a negative signal. Whereas it was once strong enough to penetrate the upper band, it is no longer able to do so, even though the trend is still rising. It is indeed a warning signal.Finally, from a simple visual inspection of the chart, we can see that the trend has accelerated several times. Trading now takes place well above its key 50- and 200-day moving averages, too. Even though this can be a subjective measure, rallies progressing at such a fast clip do tend to burn out. They may not turn into bearish trends, but they often revert back to shallower — and more sustainable — trends. It is also possible that the stock may just sit there for weeks as trend lines and averages “catch up,” but that is not a good use of trading capital.The bottom line is that the easy money has already been made here and that raises the risk for lagging performance if not an outright correction. It’s been a fun ride, but to me it does indeed look to be last call.Michael Kahn writes the Getting Technical column for Barron’s Online , which analyzes sectors and markets.

Is it too late to hop on board AB InBev?	By David KudlaAnheuser-Busch InBev /quotes/zigman/558553/delayed/quotes/nls/bud BUD -0.74%  was created in 2008 with the merger of Belgium-based InBev and U.S.-based Anheuser-Busch, and it is currently the largest brewer in the world. Following its acquisition of Grupo Modelo, the company’s portfolio contains five of the world’s top-10 selling brands of beer, and has 17 brands with retail sales over $1 billion. AB InBev is truly an international company, with its roots in Belgium and the U.S., but also significant exposure in Latin America. Brazil, home of this year’s World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics, is AB InBev’s second-largest market behind the U.S. Another push is in China, where market share is much smaller, but business prospects are promising, as net income has recently increased by nearly 50%.The financialsAB InBev has relied on a strategy of aggressive acquisition to grow revenue and margins. One look at their financials and you can see how successful the company has been in implementing their strategy. They have rapidly grown revenue and earnings per share (EPS) over the past five years and have an extremely high profit margin given the company is considered a consumer staple.Source: Morningstar, Charles Schwab. Data as of 6/27/2014.Cash flow has suffered in the short-term due to its acquisitions of Grupo Modelo in 2013 and Oriental Brewery in South Korea earlier this year. Nevertheless, their aggressive strategy to invest in brands with positive cash flow in emerging economies should continue to pay off.Dividend growthCurrently, the dividend yield is at 1.75%, but AB InBev has been aggressively increasing their dividend over the past five years as the five-year dividend growth rate is over 50%. In 2010, AB InBev paid a yearly dividend of $0.49/share and in 2013 they paid out $3.03/share. We expect dividend growth to continue as the company has a very low payout ratio.ValuationIt would be hard to consider AB InBev cheap, as it has returned nearly 30% annually over the past three years, but the P/E ratio tells a different story. The trailing 12-Month (TTM) P/E Ratio is 13.6, which is significantly cheaper than its peers Molson and Heineken (19.8 and 22.0, respectively) and less than the overall S&P 500 company average, as of June 26, 2014.Competition and concernsIn the U.S., the emergence of craft breweries has cut into the revenue of AB InBev’s core brand, Budweiser. Craft beers are sold at premium prices, and their ability to increase distribution and cut costs will lead to higher profits in the future. AB InBev appears to be slow to catch up in the craft-brewing space, but the recent acquisition of Blue Point Brewery, as well as past purchases like Goose Island and Shock Top, should continue their growth in this area. AB InBev is also addressing this concern by focusing their advertising dollars on Corona as a premium product which demands a premium price and higher margins than most of their other brands.As previously mentioned, AB InBev is an international company that has relied on acquisitions to grow the brand. If we see these acquisitions slow down, we could also see the growth rate slow as well. In the U.S., a Budweiser may be considered more of a staple than a cyclical product, but in many emerging markets, the sale of beer is very much related to GDP. AB InBev is highly reliant on the Latin American market, and their success is dependent on the future growth of these countries.RecommendationWith the combination of very strong financials, a fairly low valuation, and a high dividend growth rate, AB InBev looks poised to continue their strong growth. Although we are concerned that a potential slowdown in acquisitions and the growth of the craft-beer category could slow revenue growth, AB InBev’s management has shown they are up for the challenge. AB InBev also controls only about 20% of the world market share, so they do have room for growth and further acquisition. We recommend accumulating shares of this company on any significant pullback from current levels.Now back to that barbeque.David Kudla is CEO and Chief Investment Strategist of Mainstay Capital Management, a fee-only, independent, Registered Investment Advisor.

Good for what ales you	By Jim Lowell, MarketWatchI will round out that there are a lot of intriguing recommendations by focusing on ways to capitalize on the supply side of the micro-brew demand and demesne.While not a pure play on beer, my investment ideas reflect ways to profit from the micro-brewing trend, while also benefiting from macro factors that continue to whet demand for the ingredients in each and every can, for the can itself, and for the currency you’ll need to part with to acquire more than a taste.Before I go there, let me recap 2014 so far. The Wall Street Journal recently reported on the extraordinary year that we are all benefiting from: Everything is up. But everything is up for different reasons. Bonds got a boost at the beginning of the year by at least equal measures of general investor uncertainty and institutional and professional rebalancing, or more accurately counterbalancing, the exaggerated performance difference between 2013 stocks and bonds. As the latter yielded to the former, bonds continued to gain ground. Stocks have largely been driven by fundamentals that haven’t yet kowtowed to geopolitical unrest. Oil has hovered higher as economic growth and geopolitical risk have also risen. Soft commodities have risen on Mother Nature as much as anything.With everything rising, you’d think investors would be euphoric, perhaps irrationally so. But they aren’t. They’re not buying only one thing en masse (like OTC stocks). They’re not increasing their portfolio’s risk profile. They’re not abandoning bonds. In fact, they’re looking a bit like teetotallers who could use a beer.That joke aside, what this tells me is that the markets are healthier than any bubble-blowing pundits would have you believe. Still, it would be nice to pour some non-correlated positions through July’s tap — not just to offset the risk of a receding tide in one, some or all classic asset classes, but to take tactical advantage of areas where most investors never belly up to the bar.Long the purview of institutional investors, currency and commodity investing hit the mainstream marketplace thanks to ETFs like Powershares G10 Currency Harvest /quotes/zigman/1499149/delayed/quotes/nls/dbv DBV +0.04%  launched in September 2006, and Powershares Agriculture /quotes/zigman/448143/delayed/quotes/nls/dba DBA -0.18% , launched in January 2007.Also, there are now a bevy of single-commodity plays through ETFs and ETNs; for example, you could own either the iPath Pure Beta Aluminum ETN /quotes/zigman/4887676/delayed/quotes/nls/foil FOIL +0.34%  or the iPath DJ-UBS Aluminum Total Return ETN /quotes/zigman/1516522/delayed/quotes/nls/jju JJU +1.54%  as a bet on rising demand for aluminum from two things that seem go hand in hand (truck owners and beer drinkers), although both are extraordinarily thinly traded. I would take a more liquid, six-pack approach to things that go into or go well with (or after) beer: Buy the Powershares Agriculture. DBA’s commodity batch looks like this: Coffee (15%), cattle (20%), Cocoa (12%), wheat (11%) and more.Going the single-currency route to try and get a handle on the most profitable country quaffs can be done. Trouble is, you could get mugged: China is the world’s largest beer consumer, but with a slowing economy, the yuan — which you can own through the WisdomTree Chinese Yuan Fund /quotes/zigman/1514868/delayed/quotes/nls/cyb CYB +0.08% — seems prone to being, at best, flat.Brazil and Russia are in the top-five-consumption countries. You don’t want to own the ruble when Mad Dog Putin is foaming at the mouth. You might want to own the Brazilian real, but rising inflation doesn’t tend to mean rising currency rates. Rising rates do. I think the post-World Cup hangover isn’t going to work wonders for the real.Of course, the sober fact is that beer doesn’t drive currency prices, interest rates effectively do.Still, the U.S. is the second-largest consumer of suds, and for this as well as other reasons (my expectations for a moderately faster pace of growth chief among them), I’d put it on my July tab either directly through the Powershares Dollar Bull ETF /quotes/zigman/1502728/delayed/quotes/nls/uup UUP -0.05%  or cued with a bank shot from the Powershares G10 Currency Harvest /quotes/zigman/1499149/delayed/quotes/nls/dbv DBV +0.04%  mentioned above.Inside DBV, you’ll find some thirsty nations: U.S. dollars, euros, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Swiss francs, British pounds, Australian dollars, New Zealand dollars, Norwegian krone and Swedish krona. Of the G10 currency countries, I think only Norway doesn’t show up on the top-50 list of beer consumers by either total consumption or per-capital consumption … surprising given that they’ve been making the stuff since the Vikings were in charge and given that Carlsberg-Ringnes is based there.In the end, the micro-brewing trend may end in a bubble, while I think investing in commodities and currencies could make you the King of beers.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=85069876-02CD-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-08
Why I love SABMiller	By Charles SizemoreAfter the recent run-up — which has not been accompanied by a proportionate surge in earnings — all three megabrewers now fetch relatively high earnings multiples: AB InBev /quotes/zigman/558553/delayed/quotes/nls/bud BUD -0.74% , Heineken /quotes/zigman/13125868/delayed/quotes/nls/heiny HEINY +1.30%  and SABMiller /quotes/zigman/309144/delayed/quotes/nls/sbmry SBMRY -1.52%   trade for 19 times, 18 times and 22 times forward earnings, respectively.Of course, when you consider that the S&P 500 trades for 20 times earnings , those valuations look a lot more reasonable. Outside of an elite handful of companies — think Coca-Cola /quotes/zigman/222647/delayed/quotes/nls/ko KO -0.47%  or Disney /quotes/zigman/245568/delayed/quotes/nls/dis DIS -0.84%  — big beer names have the most recognizable brands in the world. With branding power comes premium pricing and higher returns on equity. Add to this financial strength and the recession-resistant nature of beer demand, and you have a recipe for a premium stock valuation. All else equal, the Big Three megabrewers should trade at a significant premium to the S&P 500.But the single-biggest reason why I love Big Beer as a long-term holding is its prime placement in the developing world. Big Beer went on a two-decade acquisition spree that left each of the Big Three with outsized exposure to emerging markets. This explains why beer stocks got hit particularly hard in January, when it looked as if emerging markets might be heading for a currency crisis, and why they have rallied hard in the months that followed. As investors have regained confidence in emerging markets, they’ve regained confidence in Big Beer.How does this shake out geographically? Let’s take a look. AB InBev gets about 52% of its earnings from Latin America, including Mexico. North America takes another 38%, and Europe and Asia make up most of the remainder. However, the company has very little presence in Africa. While we think of BUD as an American company, it’s actually a Latin American company with its headquarters across the Atlantic in Belgium.Heineken breaks out its numbers a little differently. “The Americas,” which lumps the United States and Canada in with developing Latin America, accounts for about 26% of profits. “Asia-Pacific” accounts for about 18% of profits. Western and Central/Eastern Europe bring in 27% and 10% of profits, respectively. But the real story is its exposure to fast-growing Africa. The Africa/Mideast region accounts for 21% of profits, a proportion I expect to see grow massively in the years ahead. (Figures add up to more than 100% due to rounding and adjustments; all data from Heineken 2013 annual report .)But if I like Heineken’s geographic mix, I love SABMiller’s. SABMiller has the highest exposure of the three to Africa. SABMiller’s African operations are responsible for 31% of profits, about 17% of which is from South Africa. But not to be neglected, SABMiller also gets 33% of its profits from Latin America, 13% from Asia Pacific and 11% and 12% from Europe and North America, respectively.Why am I so bullish on Africa’s prospects? Because frankly, it is it the last real investment frontier. Per capita GDP has more than doubled in the past decade, and according to Deloitte, seven of the 10 fastest-growing countries in the world are in Africa . As African living standards rise, so do the standards of African drinkers.What is most attractive about a frontier market like Africa is that the competition is not other beer brands; it’s home brew. Only about 20% of the beer consumed in Africa is branded or bottled. The remaining 80% is brewed at home or by small commercial establishments.I’m not talking about trendy craft brews here; I’m talking about moonshine. As incomes continue to rise in Africa, so will consumption of bottled beer.So, what does all of this mean for SABMiller’s stock?I wouldn’t expect a repeat of the 30% returns enjoyed over the past five months. For that matter, I’m not expecting much from the broader market either given today’s prices.But I would highly recommend picking up shares of SABMiller on any pullbacks. Among Western multinationals, SABMiller is uniquely well-positioned to profit from the rise of Africa’s middle classes. This is one of the most powerful macro trends of the next decade, and you want your portfolio to be on the right side of it.Charles Lewis Sizemore, CFA, is the editor of Macro Trend Investor and chief investment officer of the investment firm Sizemore Capital Management.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=1DCEBE2E-02D5-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-08

Delta drops sharply, as airlines’ selloff continues	By Tomi KilgoreDelta’s stock /quotes/zigman/463579/delayed/quotes/nls/dal DAL -1.25%   dropped 4.4% to close at a 2 ½-month low of $36.90, and has now lost 13% since closing at an all-time high on June 6. Last Wednesday, the stock slid 5.1% after Delta reported disappointing passenger revenue metrics.The second sharp decline in three sessions comes despite recent analyst calls that Delta’s selloff last week was overdone. Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said he would “buy the dip” in the stock, while Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker said the selloff was an “opportunity for investors to buy these shares.”The NYSE Arca Airline index /quotes/zigman/6015477/realtime XX:XAL -0.30%   dropped 2.3% Monday, with all 13 of its actively-traded components losing ground. The index has lost 5.4% over the last month, but was still up 20% on the year. Some investors have questioned whether Delta’s disappointing metrics are a warning that the bull thesis on the airline sector was ending, but Wolfe Research’s Keay wrote recently to clients: “We certainly don’t think it is.”Among other more active stocks in the sector, United Continental Holdings /quotes/zigman/617037/delayed/quotes/nls/ual UAL +2.38%   shed 3.2% to close at a six-month low. The stock has now lost 21% since it closed at a 6 ½-year high on Jan. 22. Many technical analysts label declines of 20% or more as bear markets.Elsewhere in the sector, JetBlue Airways /quotes/zigman/87304/delayed/quotes/nls/jblu JBLU -1.22%   shed 3.5% to $10.62, Southwest Airlines /quotes/zigman/241463/delayed/quotes/nls/luv LUV -1.73%   dropped 1.9% to $27.17, Alaska Holdings /quotes/zigman/216861/delayed/quotes/nls/alk ALK +2.26%   lost 2.2% to $94.65 and Hawaiian Holdings /quotes/zigman/88749/delayed/quotes/nls/ha HA +1.98%   slid 3% to $13.15.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=265B0E0A-0616-11E4-91DE-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

Dollar strengthens for fourth day on rate speculation	By Ben Eisen and Sara Sjolin, MarketWatchThe ICE dollar index /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY +0.0075% , which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of its rivals, rose 0.02% to 80.227, marking its highest level in almost two weeks, according to FactSet data.The euro was up slightly against the dollar /quotes/zigman/4867933/realtime/sampled EURUSD +0.0331% , with the shared currency trading at $1.3607, versus $1.3604 late Thursday. The greenback slipped against the yen /quotes/zigman/4868099/realtime/sampled USDJPY +0.0951%   and traded down 0.4% at ¥101.87, from ¥102.21 late Thursday.The move came as Goldman Sachs on Sunday moved up its forecast for the first rate hike to the third quarter of 2015 from the first quarter of 2016, based on the strong improvement in the labor market and overall financial conditions over the past few months. The nonfarm-payrolls report for June, published on Thursday, showed 288,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy last month, far beating analyst expectations.Investors will get more details on the Fed members’ rate views when the minutes from the June FOMC meeting are published on Wednesday.Markets to receive clues about Fed’s views on jobsHow to declare your financial independenceIMF’s Lagarde: Public investment can aid growth	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3CF6E920-05AF-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

Corinthian Colleges leads for-profit education stocks lower	By Angela JohnsonShares of ITT Educational Services Inc. /quotes/zigman/138719/delayed/quotes/nls/esi ESI -1.53%   dropped 2.2% to $16.40, Apollo Education Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/57542/delayed/quotes/nls/apol APOL -3.48%  shares were down 1.2% to $30.85 and Career Education Corp. /quotes/zigman/66286/delayed/quotes/nls/ceco CECO -0.22%  shares declined 6.7% to $4.62.The beleaguered Corinthian Colleges Inc. /quotes/zigman/54226/delayed/quotes/nls/coco COCO -5.20%   has been beset by legal and financial troubles recently.The company has been sued by attorneys general in California and Massachusetts. The California lawsuit alleges Corinthian Colleges Inc. misrepresented job placement rates to students and investors. It has also been under investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for violating the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010.According to the company’s fiscal third-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, net revenue was down 11.7% from the prior year, the student population decreased 13.7% and new student enrollments dropped 13.1%. On July 2, the company received a notice of delisting from NASDAQ due to 30 consecutive days of closing below the $1.00 NASDAQ minimum price requirement.“The for-profit sector has been impacted for some time with declining enrollments and regulatory pressure,” said analyst Jeffrey Silber at BMO Capital markets. “However, the likely wind-down of Corinthian was somewhat surprising given the reasons behind it (non-timely compliance with regulatory requests). It has certainly put the rest of the sector on notice, in our view, that the Department of Education means business.”Corinthian Colleges Inc. has suspended enrolling new students until July 8; the school will also provide written notices to all students regarding its plans for their perspective campuses or online programs.“We are pleased to have reached an agreement with ED that helps protect the interests of our students, employees and other stakeholders,” said Jack Massimino, Corinthian chairman and chief executive officer. “This agreement allows our students to continue their education and helps minimize the personal and financial issues that affect our 12,000 employees and their families.”Corinthian is the parent company of Everest College, WyoTech and Heald College.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Obamacare’s latest court threat could be lethalDoes Facebook break up marriages?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0D2DF71A-060E-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

Yield curve flattens as investors rethink Fed view	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchFollowing a far stronger-than-expected jobs report last week, investors have been contemplating whether improving data could usher in earlier hikes to the Fed’s key lending rates. While investors showed a subdued initial reaction last week, some on Wall Street have begun to suggest the Fed could be pressured to tighten sooner.The 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +0.82%  yield, which falls as prices rise, was down 3 basis points at 2.619%, according to Tradeweb. The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR +0.33%  yield fell 4 basis points to 3.442%.Meanwhile, the 3-year note /quotes/zigman/4868286/delayed 3_YEAR +6.20%  yield was up 1 basis point at 0.970%. The 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR +0.88%  yield had a more subdued reaction, slipping half a basis point to 1.735%.The differential between the 5-year yield and 30-year yield narrowed in what’s known as a flattening yield curve. The spread shrank to 1.71 percentage points, near the five-year low touched in the spring.Goldman Sachs economists on Sunday moved forward their forecast for the first rate hike to the third quarter of 2015 from the first quarter of 2016. Traders who bet on the future path of the policy rate using fed funds futures currently project the first rate hike occurring in June 2015, according to CME FedWatch.“The payroll data appears unequivocally strong, and its hard to find legitimate ‘holes’ in the data and thus does lend credibility to the alternate policy path view: That the data is going to overtake the Fed in policy path implementation,” said David Robin, co-head of financial futures and options at Newedge, in a note.Some say the yield curve is pricing in a cycle of Fed rate hikes that doesn’t look probable. The curve implies that the Fed will start hiking rates somewhat late, then lift rates slowly, perhaps in sporadic formation, with the eventual long-term policy rate remaining low, according to Boris Rjavinski, rates and rate-derivatives strategist at UBS. However, the likelihood of such an outcome all happening at once is low, he asserts, particularly given that the Fed’s large balance sheet may necessitate more hawkish action.“Each outcome seems possible individually, but once you start compounding probabilities, it seems unlikely that all of them would happen together,” he said.Given that outlook, he suggests investors sell 2-year notes /quotes/zigman/4868354/delayed 2_YEAR 0.00%  and 7-year notes /quotes/zigman/4868264/delayed 7_YEAR +0.64%  to buy 3-year /quotes/zigman/4868286/delayed 3_YEAR +6.20%  notes and 5-Year notes.Traders will look to auctions of $27 billion in 3-year notes on Tuesday, as well as $21 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday, and $13 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday.The Fed will also release the minutes of its last policy meeting on Wednesday, which may provide more clues about the central bank’s thinking.Why trading volume is tumbling, explained in 5 charts10 cities where foreign companies create the most jobsAre these the dumbest investing ideas you’ve ever heard?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=45E14FFA-05D5-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

Second investor calls for PetSmart to consider a sale	By David BenoitLongview Asset Management LLC, which owns nearly 9% of PetSmart /quotes/zigman/54520/delayed/quotes/nls/petm PETM -0.29%   and has been an investor since 2005, asked the company to consider a potential sale or other strategic alternatives in a letter to PetSmart’s board Monday.Longview believes a private-equity firm may value the pet-supply company at more than its current stock price, according to the letter.Longview’s move follows Thursday’s disclosure by Jana Partners that it had taken a 9.9% stake in PetSmart. The activist investor said it would seek talks with the retailer about strategic options, including a potential sale and a significant return of capital to shareholders.Earlier on Monday PetSmart Inc. said its board has been reviewing potential changes to the pet-supply retailer’s capital structure, including returning capital to shareholders, amid activist pressure.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3D852DD4-0613-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

That month, the spot Comex gold contract reached an intraday high of $1,929.20, more than $600 above Thursday’s settle price of $1,320.40.He puts gold’s fair value today at a little higher than $800.Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors, said that markets are too liberal in expecting rate hikes in the second half of 2015.“It became harder to project the next rate hike because the Fed has moved away from a hard target, like the unemployment number.We think that it is likely to be inflation and not unemployment that will push the Fed to hike rates and probably sooner than when the markets are expecting.”Via Benjamin Pimentel: Apple June sales strong ahead of busy fall seasonApple saw a big sales lift in June ahead of what’s expected to be a busy fall season as the company appears set to unveil new products, including the iWatch and the iPhone 6, an analyst said Monday.Share in the company rose 1.3%.Paul Atkinson at Aberdeen Asset Management says investors have become “confident.” And he tells Chuck Jaffe, that may put them in a dangerous spot.Via Sara Sjolin: European stocks slide after weak German production dataEuropean stocks retreated on Monday after a surprisingly steep drop in German industrial production data sparked worries that Europe’s economic engine is losing steam.The Stoxx Europe 600 index dropped 0.9% to close at 344.80, after finishing last week with the biggest weekly advance since March.Quick market update: stocks deeper in the red.S&P 500 .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX  -0.51%Dow .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA  -0.40%Nasdaq .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP  -0.75%Market quietly putting in a pretty rough day for stocks.

Japan braces for ‘super-typhoon’ Neoguri	By Alexander MartinAs of Monday afternoon, Typhoon Neoguri was moving up the Pacific Ocean toward Okinawa at a speed of 25 kilometers per hour (16 miles an hour) with winds of up to 180 kph and gusts as strong as 252 kph, the agency said.The season’s eighth typhoon is expected to approach Okinawa’s Miyako Island with full force by Tuesday morning with gusts of up to 270 kph. With the typhoon’s center expected to sweep the western edge of Okinawa, the agency issued its highest warning to the Miyako island area Monday evening.“We issue special warnings when we anticipate immense damage of a scale only seen every few decades,” an agency official said.The U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center has designated Neoguri a “super-typhoon,” a category it uses for typhoons with winds more than 240 kph.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=EE694740-0611-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

Alibaba Founder Jack Ma’s recent deals raise flags	By Juro OsawaIn at least one case, Ma and a group of his allies have invested in a company on behalf of Alibaba through private vehicles. In other deals, a private-equity fund co-founded by Ma invested alongside Alibaba.Alibaba has addressed the arrangements in its filings with U.S. securities regulators, last amended June 26, saying that Ma sometimes invests on behalf of the company, and will take steps in some cases to limit his personal gains from the transactions--either by transferring profits back to Alibaba, or giving the money to charity.But governance experts warn that such investments are a recipe for trouble, because they blur personal and business interests, involving both Ma and Alibaba in transactions that could benefit him and a group of influential allies, and over which most Alibaba shareholders have little control or oversight.“These situations create conflicts of interest that leave [Alibaba’s] minority shareholders more vulnerable to being shortchanged,” says Simon Wong, a corporate-governance adviser affiliated with Northwestern University in Chicago and the London School of Economics.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Obamacare faces another court threat -- and this one could be fatalTesla owners are doing this while the rest of us sleep	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7448E70E-060C-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

Oil settles at one-month low; natural gas tumbles	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchNatural-gas futures, meanwhile, skidded to close at their lowest level since January on strong U.S. inventories.Crude for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.0097%  fell 53 cents, or 0.5%, to settle at $103.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Based on the most-active contracts, prices haven’t closed below $104 since June 6.Libya on Sunday said it lifted force majeure on two oil ports rebels handed over last week, which would allow the return of significant exports that had been halted for nearly a year. Force majeure protects exporters from legal action in case of disruptions but also bars loads from the affected terminal. The terminals have a total daily loading capacity of around 560,000 barrels.The announcement from Libya that the ports are now open bring on close to 500,000 per barrels per day, said Tariq Zahir, managing member of Tyche Capital Advisors. Added to that, fighting in Iraq has stayed in the northern part of the country and “has not spread to the southern part of Iraq where the bulk of the [oil] production is,” he said.Expectations that Libyan oil would be returning to the market last week contributed to a 2.3% weekly decline by Brent futures, the global benchmark’s biggest weekly drop since January, Commerzbank strategists said.On Monday, the August Brent contract /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -0.28% lost 40 cents, or 0.4%, to $110.24 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.Libya, which has total capacity of around 1.3 million barrels a day, produced only 200,000 barrels a day in June, the Commerzbank strategists noted, which means the country was responsible for around half of the unscheduled OPEC production outages.“Thus oil prices are likely to fall further in the short term just as soon as the growing oil supply from Libya is confirmed in the official data,” the Commerzbank strategists wrote.Petroleum products traded on Nymex Monday also declined. August gasoline /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 -0.43%  fell 3 cents, or 1%, to $2.99 a gallon, while August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821453/delayed HOQ4 -0.35% shed more than a cent to $2.915 a gallon.Natural-gas prices fell sharply on the back of eight consecutive, triple-digit weekly increases into U.S. storage, according to Matt Smith, a commodity analyst at Schneider Electric.“Weather outlooks continue to tilt bullish in terms of above-normal conditions for much of the U.S. over the coming weeks. Nonetheless, ongoing staunch supply offsets any demand concerns, leaving natty to charge lower,” he said in a note.August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 +0.10%  declined by 18 cents, or 4.1%, to end at $4.225 per million British thermal units.

Gold futures extend jobs-related selloff	By Myra P. Saefong and Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatchGold for August delivery /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.58%  fell $3.60, or 0.3%, to settle at $1,317 an ounce after losing more than $10, or 0.8%, on Thursday — the last regular trading day of a holiday-shortened week. Tracking the most-active contracts, prices haven’t closed at a level this low since June 26.September silver /quotes/zigman/12294966/delayed SIU4 +0.60% also shed 12 cents, or 0.6%, to $21.01 an ounce.Gold ended the preceding holiday-shortened week with its first loss in five sessions as investors moved into equities on the back of a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report.“Interest rate speculation regarding the Federal Reserve possibly raising interest rates sooner than expected may have contributed to the weakness,” said Mark O’Byrne, a director at GoldCore, based in Dublin. “From a momentum and technical perspective, gold is looking much better and this should lead to an uptick in demand.”But according to analysts at HSBC, gold could be in store for more red ink.“The real test for gold may be the return of market participants following the holiday, leaving us to believe that bullion may soften in the near term,” they said.Meanwhile, one of academia’s leading experts on gold prices has said the odds are poor that the metal will return soon to its all-time high, putting its fair value today around $800 an ounce.Elsewhere in metals trading, October platinum /quotes/zigman/19534176/delayed PLV4 -0.34%  lost $12.10, or 0.8%, to end at $1,495.60 an ounce, while September palladium /quotes/zigman/18010104/delayed PAU4 +0.37%  gained $7.05, or 0.8%, to $868.95 an ounce.

Web startup Box raises $150 million ahead of IPO	By Mike Spector and Douglas MacMillanThe online-storage startup has raised $150 million in funding from private-equity firm TPG and hedge fund Coatue Management, according to two people familiar with the matter. The financing--rare for a company that already has filed for an IPO--values Box at about $2.4 billion and may be announced as soon as Monday, the people said.The extra cash extends the amount of time Box can put off its plans for an IPO. The company publicly filed for an IPO in March, but it delayed those plans to wait out a period of weakening demand for U.S. technology stocks. Companies like Box that sell online, or cloud, software to businesses were particularly punished because of their high-cost business models.Box expects to go public by the end of this year but not until after Labor Day, one of the people said. The IPO market tends to pick up between then and Thanksgiving Day.While the new funding values Box only slightly higher than last December, when it took funds at a valuation of $2 billion, it raises the expectations for the value of its IPO shares.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:5 great brands that are bad investments10 U.S. cities where foreign companies create the most jobsSoon everyone will be an electric company	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=2BCFE7D8-0603-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

Peabody Energy among biggest S&P 500 losers after downgrade	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Peabody Energys stock /quotes/zigman/282895/delayed/quotes/nls/btu BTU -0.13% slid 3.2%, enough to make it the third-biggest loser among S&P 500 components, after Deutsche Bank downgraded the coal producer to hold from buy, citing concerns over coal pricing and ongoing cost pressures. Analyst Jorge Beristain also lowered his stock price target to $19 from $23. He expects second-quarter adjusted losses to widen to 26 cents a share from 19 cents a share in the first quarter, and expects realized coal prices to decline 1% on the quarter. The stock, which has lost 13% over the last couple months and 18% so far this year, is on course to close at the lowest level since March 27.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=ADB3FAA6-D12C-4686-991D-CF9618A1CF05&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

Obama to unveil border control funding request: spokesman	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- President Barack Obama will formally ask Congress on Tuesday for more funding to secure the border with Mexico, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Monday. White House officials have said in media reports that the funding request is likely to be for $2 billion. There has been a steady stream of children from Central America crossing the border illegally this year. The funds are needed to pay for more immigration judges and asylum officials to process the backlog of cases. There is a view that is shared among both Democrats and Republicans that there is work that we can do to continue to secure the borders. And processing these cases through the immigration system is a part of that, he said. Earnest said the supplemental would request funding for some other things but did not provide specifics.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=55965CCC-6AAF-4233-941E-AB489CA2EED8&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

An awkward time for ECB transparency		/news/awkward-time-ecb-transparency-132539546.html	2014-07-07
Hillary Clinton begins to move away from Obama	By Peter NicholasPeople are “really, really nervous” about their future, . Clinton said at an event in Colorado last week that included hints of her emerging strategy to convey that she would be more effective in the pursuit of Democratic policy goals than Obama has been during his time in office.“They don’t think the economy has recovered in a way that has helped them or their families,” Clinton said. In contrast, Obama sounded almost cheery after Thursday’s jobs report, saying the country could make even more progress if Congress were willing to “set politics aside, at least occasionally.”Clinton hasn’t repudiated Obama, who made her secretary of state in his first term, and comments aimed at highlighting her differences with Obama are often implied rather than stated bluntly.But in tone and substance, the presumed presidential candidate has made clear in recent public appearances that she wouldn’t be running for a de facto third Obama term in the White House. The strategy could help Clinton tackle one of her biggest challenges if she decides to run: how to separate herself from Obama without alienating Democrats and Obama supporters.The balancing act likely would be even trickier for Vice President Joe Biden, another potential Democratic candidate in 2016. Biden, closely tied to the White House and its foreign and domestic policies, could find it enormously difficult to chart an independent path if he launches a campaign.All candidates from the same party that holds the White House face a tricky choice about whether to embrace the incumbent.In 2000, then-Vice President Al Gore was careful about positioning himself as a continuation of Democrat Bill Clinton’s presidency, since some voters were disillusioned with Clinton in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. In 1988, though, Republican George H.W. Bush aligned himself directly with the popular Ronald Reagan. Gore lost, while Bush won.Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and former chief speech writer for Pete Wilson when the Republican was California’s governor, suggested that Clinton’s distancing strategy at least partly reflects Obama’s lackluster popularity.“If the president had 60% approval ratings, she would be hitching her wagon to him,” Whalen said. “At 40%, he’s an anchor.” Still, given the delicate spot Clinton is in, “to the extent that she throws him under the bus, she has to run over him at a very slow speed.”A senior Obama administration official said the White House is supportive of Clinton. Obama’s team understands there will be moments when Clinton and the White House aren’t in lock step, the official said. Clinton’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.Clinton gave a gentle account of their policy differences in her new book, “Hard Choices,” though she wrote that she would have armed moderate Syrian rebels at a much earlier point in the country’s bloody civil war.In another contrast, Clinton has said U.S. presidents must never stop courting Congress. Obama has questioned whether such efforts make any difference. Clinton expressed skepticism of candidates with “beautiful vision,” while Obama still hammers on his 2008 campaign mantra: “Hope.”“I mean, some people can paint a beautiful vision,” she said at a CNN event last month. “And, thankfully, we can all learn from that. But then, can you, with the tenacity, the persistence, the getting-knocked down/getting-back-up resilience, can you lead us there?”An expanded version of this story is available at WSJ.com.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E36D82C0-05D5-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07
Four costs new homeowners should plan for	By AJ Smith, Credit.comMovingMoving may seem minor but it’s a cost that often comes very soon after forking over a large sum of money. Once you’ve purchased the home you want to live in, you have to get there. Whether you rent a truck and do the heavy lifting yourself or you have full-service movers take care of the hard work, there will be a cost to move all of your things from your current home into your next home. This is important to remember when you are figuring out how much of a down payment you can afford. You want to make sure you have enough left over to get to that wonderful house once you buy it!Mortgage paymentsWhile renters are usually used to paying on a monthly basis, owning a home almost always comes with monthly mortgage payments. This includes the repayment portion of the principal as well as interest. The monthly expense depends on the amount borrowed, interest rate and whether your mortgage is fixed-rate or adjustable-rate. Be sure to do the research and make an agreement with a monthly cost you can afford.Taxes and insuranceAs a homeowner, you have to pay property taxes and home insurance. The construction materials and location of your home affect the cost of insurance--and insurance can rise over time. You may also need supplemental insurance if you live in an earthquake or flood zone. These expenses are often paid each month, and are often rolled into your monthly mortgage payment.Utilities and maintenanceEven when you consider household appliances, furniture and landscaping, basic upkeep can be the most expensive aspect of owning a home. Electricity, water, trash, gas and even more bills come each month--though these vary greatly depending on seasons and lifestyle. Repairing and maintaining the features of a home can add up quickly, depending on home and appliance age. Furniture to fill your home, decorative items for holidays and the everyday, as well as lawn care also add up--especially if you hire professionals.It’s a good idea to consider these costs when you are deciding whether to buy or rent a home and to have some cash reserve on hand for these costs.More From Credit.com:Why You Should Check Your Credit Before Buying a HomeHow to Find & Choose a Mortgage LenderHow to Search for Your Next Home 	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=048B431C-0242-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

Apple June sales strong ahead of busy fall season	By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatchApple’s /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL -0.64%  second-quarter sales are projected to rise 20% to 21%, “which is stronger than the average increase of 10% over the past nine months,” Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White told clients in a note.The projection was based on data from “leading Taiwan-based suppliers that generate a high percentage of sales from Apple.”Apple shares were up 1.1% to $95.03 in Monday trade. The company’s stock has risen more than 27% in the past three months, partly in anticipation of new products expected to be introduced later this year, including a new iPhone and Apple’s smartwatch, dubbed the iWatch.“Although we are encouraged by the strong performance by our Apple Barometer, we are more focused on Apple’s ability to execute on new product ramps that we anticipate this fall and the consumer appetite for these new devices,” White added. He dubbed the coming rollout as Apple’s “Fab Fall” launch.The product introductions are expected to take place at a time when Apple is wrestling with doubts regarding the company’s ability to innovate. Some analysts have argued that Apple needs to offer smartphones with bigger screens to remain competitive.“Traveling to China over the years, we noticed the sharp rise of Apple’s momentum has turned into a crawl over the past 18 months as competitors launched mega-sized smartphones,” White wrote.“We believe these concerns have negatively impacted the perception around Apple and the stock’s valuation,” White wrote. “However, we believe both issues could be solved with what we are coining a ‘Fab Fall’ launch, with the iPhone 6 and the much-anticipated ‘iWatch.’”King Digital tops IPO price6 ways Google can help you land a job	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=6ACD2B88-05E2-11E4-91DE-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

Another sign the bull market is nearing its end	By Mark Hulbert, MarketWatchCHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — Here’s another sign the bull market in stocks may be nearing an end: Companies have dramatically reduced share repurchases.New stock buybacks fell to $23.2 billion in June, the lowest level in a year and a half, according to fund tracker TrimTabs Investment Research. In May, the total was just $24.8 billion, and the monthly average in 2013 was $56 billion.That’s worrisome, according to TrimTabs CEO David Santschi, because “buyback volume has a high positive correlation with stock prices.”How high? Consider the correlation coefficient, a statistic that reflects the degree to which two series tend to zig and zag in lockstep. It ranges from plus 1 (which means the two series are perfectly correlated) to minus 1 (the two move inversely to each other). A zero correlation coefficient would mean there is no detectable relationship between the two series.According to Santschi, the correlation coefficient between monthly buyback volume and the stock market’s level, for the period from 2006 until this spring, was 0.61. That’s highly statistically significant.A high correlation also makes theoretical sense. That’s because, when a company announces a share-repurchase program, it sends a strong signal that its management really thinks its stock is undervalued — so much so that it’s willing to put its money where its mouth is. So it’s bullish for the overall market when lots of companies are simultaneously announcing such programs.To be sure, the monthly buyback data are quite volatile, so two months of anemic numbers don’t automatically doom the market. Santschi, for one, says that, if the slow pace continues through July, “we will become very concerned.”Hedge-fund manager Douglas Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management, relates the slowdown in buybacks to the recent M&A wave. He says that both activities represent the implicit recognition by corporate managements that their internal operations are unable to produce sufficient revenue growth to maintain their stock prices.Over the past five years, for example, per-share sales growth for S&P 500 companies has been an annualized 2.4%, lagging far behind the 20% annualized earnings per share growth rate. One of the ways in which corporate managers have been able to extract that much EPS growth out of such anemic sales growth, Kass argues, is through share repurchases.As their share prices become more and more inflated, however, corporate managers become increasingly reluctant to buy them. The logical thing to do instead is buy up other companies, paying with shares of their inflated stock.That’s what is happening now, Kass argues: “There’s a baton exchange from buybacks into M&A activity.”And, as I detailed at greater length in my column earlier this week, past M&A waves have all ended with a precipitous decline in stock prices.Click here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Sentiment Indexes.More from MarketWatch:7 market myths that make investors poorerDow 17,000 is on the wrong side of historySay hello to U.S. economy’s newest bubble	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8B2B0D1C-06B1-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
King Digital shares jump after upgrade	By Tomi KilgoreThe Candy Crush Saga game maker’s stock /quotes/zigman/29444289/delayed/quotes/nls/king KING -2.36%   climbed 4.2% to $22.79, putting it on an early track to close above its initial offering price of $22.50 for just the second time. The stock, which went public on March 26, 2014, didn’t trade above its IPO price until last Wednesday, when it rose to as high as $23.48 intraday before closing at $22.53.King’s shares have gained 49% since closing at a post-IPO low of $15.32 on May 13.Piper analyst Michael Olson raised his rating on King to overweight from neutral, and bumped up his stock price target to $28 from $19, citing the recent popularity of the company’s games other than Candy Crush Saga.Given that King’s Pet Rescue and Farm Heroes have maintained a top-15 grossing iPhone rank over the last six months or so, Olson wrote in a note to clients “it is becoming increasingly clear that King is successfully diversifying beyond Candy Crush.” And with Bubble Witch 2, which launched in early June, moving quickly to a top-20 grossing iPhone ranking, the company appears to have created a formula to successful new and follow-on game launches, Olson said.He added that the new Candy Crush Soda game, which he expects to launch within the next several months, “will prove to be a catalyst for King shares.”More must reads from MarketWatch :5 great brands that are bad investmentsWhy trading volume is tumbling, in 5 chartsHow to buy momentum stocks without getting burned	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B79F9A66-05DF-11E4-91DE-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

Gold might be up this year, but it’s worth only $800	By Mark Hulbert, MarketWatchThe gold bugs are stirring.A 10% gain by the yellow metal this year is rekindling hope among long-suffering bulls that the major bear market that began nearly three years ago finally might be over.They argue that gold will continue to rise because investors will be seeking a hedge against rising inflation, currency fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty.Yet according to Duke University finance professor Campbell Harvey, one of academia’s leading experts on gold prices, the odds are poor that the metal will return any time soon to its all-time high in August 2011. That month, the spot Comex gold contract reached an intraday high of $1,929.20, more than $600 above Thursday’s settle price of $1,320.40.He puts gold’s fair value today at a little higher than $800.A valuation model Harvey proposed in a National Bureau of Economic Research study 18 months ago, when gold was nearly $1,700 an ounce, correctly foresaw that the metal was overvalued.That model is based on the tendency for gold to decline whenever the ratio of its price to the consumer-price index rises well above its average level of about 3.4, and to rise when it is significantly below that average. With the CPI now at 237.1, this ratio stands at 5.6.To be sure, Harvey acknowledges, gold is perfectly capable of taking a long time to return to its fair value — and by no means will the path it takes be a straight line. So a near-term rally isn’t out of the question.There is a shorter-term factor that nevertheless leads him to doubt gold can mount even a short-term rally that is very significant: rising Treasury yields, which go up as bond prices fall.Over the past decade, Harvey points out, gold’s price has been quick to respond to changes in Treasury yields — rising as yields fall, and vice versa. If you believe that yields will on average be higher in coming months than where they are today, as he does, then “gold will most likely decline” over the shorter term.Shouldn’t inflation be taken into account in predicting gold’s performance? After all, gold is widely considered to be one of the best inflation hedges.But gold’s track record as an inflation hedge depends greatly on your time horizon, according to Claude Erb, Harvey’s co-author on the National Bureau of Economic Research study and a former commodities and fixed-income manager at mutual-fund firm TCW Group.Over the short term, he says, gold is a very unreliable inflation hedge. It is only over the long term that it can be a decent hedge — and he emphasizes that this long term must be measured over many decades at a minimum.Based on the markets’ recent behavior, Erb is confident that if inflation and Treasury yields were both to rise over the next couple of years, the most likely outcome still would be a lower gold price.What steps should you take in your portfolio if you think inflation is about to heat up? Erb acknowledges that there isn’t a great short-term inflation hedge. But he says that intermediate-term government bond funds should largely hold their own when inflation and interest rates rise, since they can reinvest in higher-yielding issues as their older bonds mature, thereby absorbing the losses of principal caused by those higher yields.Erb points to the surprising resilience from 1966 through 1981 of intermediate-term U.S. government bonds — those with five-year maturities. This 16-year period is often considered the worst environment in recent history for bond investors, since intermediate Treasury yields nearly tripled. Nevertheless, according to Ibbotson Associates data, these bonds produced a 5.8% annualized return over the period.The most popular intermediate-term bond fund, among those advisers monitored by the Hulbert Financial Digest who have beaten the S&P 500 over the past 15 years, is the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Investment-Grade Fund /quotes/zigman/133678/realtime VFICX +0.20% , which charges annual fees of 0.20%, or $20 per $10,000 invested.The fund’s current yield is 2.6%, and its average effective duration of the bonds it owns is 5.2 years. (“Duration” is a measure of sensitivity to interest-rate fluctuations; a lower duration implies less sensitivity.)If you nevertheless want to bet on gold, or simply want to follow the advice of many financial advisers to allocate a small amount of your portfolio — perhaps 5% — to gold for diversification purposes, shares of gold-mining companies are probably the cheapest way in, as the shares of such companies have significantly lagged behind bullion over the past 18 months.Since the beginning of 2013, for example, the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index has fallen 42%, nearly double bullion’s 22% loss. Shares of smaller gold-mining companies have lagged behind even more.Two exchange-traded funds that track such stocks are Market Vectors Gold Miners /quotes/zigman/420125/delayed/quotes/nls/gdx GDX +1.61% , with a 0.53% expense ratio, or $53 per $10,000 invested, and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners /quotes/zigman/18928026/delayed/quotes/nls/gdxj GDXJ +1.67% , with expenses of 0.57%. In the first half of 2014, these funds gained 25% and 36%, respectively.If you prefer the shares of individual gold-mining companies, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold /quotes/zigman/154700/delayed/quotes/nls/fcx FCX +0.18%  is currently the one most recommended by the Hulbert Financial Digest-monitored advisers who have beaten the S&P 500 over the past 15 years.

When will Facebook Nation say ‘enough is enough’?	By Jon Friedman, MarketWatchFacebook /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB -3.88% is playing a dangerous game. Yes, it has amassed a remarkable roll of about 1.2 billion users worldwide in a mere decade. But to impress its lifeblood of advertisers, Facebook needs to show growth and convince Madison Avenue that its interests are best served on Facebook and not Twitter /quotes/zigman/23556538/delayed/quotes/nls/twtr TWTR -7.01%  or another website. To serve advertisers, Facebook relentlessly accumulates data about its users.At the same time, those individuals are becoming increasingly fed up with the company’s practice of crossing a border into violating acceptable rights of privacy.Facebook was recently caught manipulating users’ emotions during what was called a scientific experiment. By massaging the Facebook News Feed algorithm and scrutinizing 700,000 Facebook users’ posts, the company’s data scientists and research professionals learned that emotional states can be transmitted between people without actually experiencing in-person contact.The company seemed more put out that it had been caught in the act than sincerely remorseful. Last week, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said, in words that will likely resonate for a long time in the Clumsy-Apology Hall of Fame: “We didn’t mean to upset you.”Sandberg is lucky “Saturday Night Live” has gone off the air for the summer, so she couldn’t be lampooned for what many have since called a disingenuous apology.But some Facebook users do feel upset and violated — and concerned about what Facebook might do next. Brooke Anderson, an American journalist who lives in Lebanon and relies on Facebook to help her communicate with loved ones, told me she is angry about a number of privacy-related factors. In a neat bit of social media symmetry, Anderson wrote to me in a Facebook email:“To name a few: the idea that a random FB ‘data specialist’ could be reading my personal messages, or even that a machine could be analyzing my emotions through my online behavior, or that a glitch could make my private messages public. So many things. We’re trusting a lot of our personal information and behavior in one company. Where is that information going? How will it affect us?”Gee whiz, Facebook Nation. Sandberg said she was sorry, right?Facebook has invariably managed to skate around bad publicity. The social media behemoth was criticized for its unorthodox road show, blasted when technical glitches marred the first day of trading and castigated as soon as those shares started tanking. Those firestorms now seem like ancient brushfires.And when studies revealed that Facebook seemed out of touch with the coveted demographic of young consumers, the company did what lots of corporations do to get out of a public-relations jam: Throw money at the problem. Facebook spent $19 billion to acquire WhatsApp and get its cool card punched once again on Wall Street.Facebook is nothing if not resourceful. CEO Mark Zuckerberg & Co. understands that those 1.2 billion people pretty much view Facebook by now as a benign addiction. They might sooner go without their morning cup of coffee than a daily (or even hourly) visit to their Facebook home page. Plus, by steadfastly keeping Facebook’s communications services free of charge, Zuckerberg knows it would require a Herculean effort for many users to walk away.As Philip Panasci, a pizza-parlor proprietor on Cape Cod, Mass., and long-time Facebook user, told me: “Whenever someone complains to me about Facebook, I say, ‘Gee, you’re right. If I were you, I wouldn’t pay my Facebook bill this month.’ ”Still, Sandberg wouldn’t have bothered to make a public apology if the company didn’t smell trouble. Facebook now must restore its goodwill with many of its users. Is it only a matter of time before Facebook Nation finally runs out of patience with the Company That Has Nine Lives?More from MarketWatch:5 great brands that I think are bad investmentsHow to buy momentum stocks without getting burned10 things rich people know that you don’t	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=76358EDE-05E2-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07
Tesla falls 1%; wants to study Model S in L.A. crash	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Shares of Tesla Motors Inc. /quotes/zigman/118681/delayed/quotes/nls/tsla TSLA -1.61% fell 1.3% on Monday, the first market day after a stolen Model S crashed and burned in Los Angeles on July 4. The company said Sunday it wants to examine the remnants of the Model S involved in the accident, according to a Bloomberg News report. An unidentified man stole the car from a Tesla service center and police gave chase. The Model S hit at least two cars and a lamp post, splitting in half. The crash ignited a fire in the Model S. In March, Tesla reinforced Model S cars with underbody plates to protect its battery, following news of battery fires last year.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=86092980-EA79-4D17-B8CF-8574D81CBEE0&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

4 trends that will put markets back on a roller coaster	By Matthew LynnOn every available measure, the markets have become far less volatile this year than at any time over the last decade. Watching a nil-nil draw between a couple of sides that were already out of the World Cup was a more exciting way to spend June than looking at the price action on a terminal.And yet, in truth, that is very odd. Over the past decade, the long-term trend has been for the markets to get more volatile rather than less.In reality, this is a lull, not a permanent end to all storms. There are four big trends that will get the markets jumping more than a squirrel that has just had a can of Coke. Such as? Technology. A bond crash in the euro zone. The rise of the frontier markets. And a collapse in company profits. The only question is, when will it happen?There is no denying that the markets have been exceptionally calm of late. The S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX -0.70%  has not managed a move of more than 1% in a single day since all the way back in the middle of April. The VIX /quotes/zigman/2766221/delayed VIX +5.74%  , known as the fear index because it measures expected future volatility, is hitting all-time lows.It is not just equities. It is currencies as well. JP Morgan Chase’s global FX volatility index last week sank to it lowest level since it was started way back in 1992. The BOE Volatility Index for U.S. Treasuries is down sharply over the past year. Even Greek bonds, which used to swing by double-digit percentage point all the time, trade very quietly right now. The excitement has drained out of every market you look at.True, the roller-coaster markets of the last 30 years, with their massive swings between bull and bear runs, are not necessarily the historical norm. A few years ago, JP Morgan analyzed collapses, taking a 15% fall in the value of S&P 500 index over a 15-day period as its definition of a “crash’. For the post-1946 period, there was one of those in 1962, and another in 1987, but then you had to wait until 2002 for the next one.A person might spend a whole career in finance, and only see that kind of volatility once in their lifetime. In fact the markets don’t always swing around like a yo-yo. For many years, they can just plod steadily upwards — and this might well be one of those periods.There are lot of explanations being put forward for why that might be so. Some people think it is a side effect of central banks printing money. Others explain it by the fact there are fewer quoted companies than there used to be.But the more interesting question is this. If the markets are to turn into a roller-coaster again, what will be the trigger for that? Here are four possibilities.One, technology. High-frequency, computerised trading has been blamed for much of the volatility of the last decade, including the “flash crashes.” Stricter regulation, and smarter computers, may have curbed that. But there is a lot of technological innovation in finance right now, from peer-to-peer lending, to crowd-funding, to trading based on social media feeds. Has that made the markets safer, or more dangerous? No one knows. But the last round of innovations generated a lot more volatility, and it would be rash to assume that this one won’t as well.Two, euro-zone bonds. You don’t exactly need to be a financial genius to work out that something very strange is happening in the euro-zone peripheral bond market. Italian yields /quotes/zigman/15866497/realtime BX:TMBMKIT-10Y +2.04%   have fallen to 2.7%, only a whisker above U.S. rates. Spanish yields /quotes/zigman/15866444/realtime BX:TMBMKES-10Y +1.68%   are 2.68%, and French rates /quotes/zigman/15866467/realtime BX:TMBMKFR-10Y -0.15%   are just 1.6%, well below what the U.S. pays /quotes/zigman/15866666/realtime BX:TMUBMUSD10Y +0.39%  to borrow money.But hold on. These are all countries with virtually zero growth, crushing levels of unemployment, government debts that are spinning out of control, and trapped within a currency that appears to offer them little hope of ever inflating their way out of trouble. A Florida sub-prime mortgage taken out in the name of someone’s dog looks a safe bet by comparison. As a general rule, when the markets wildly overprice an asset, big trouble is only just around the corner. There is no reason to think this is any different.Three, frontier markets. With most of the traditional emerging markets really middle-income nations, with many of the same issues to confront as their developed peers, the real action has moved onto the frontier markets of the Middle East, Africa, and central Asia. There are undoubtedly high returns to be made there, but they are also high risk.If volatility is in decline, someone forget to tell the traders in Dubai, for example. It was upgraded from a frontier to an emerging market this year, but that didn’t stop a 22% drop in the market in June. If a bear market is defined as a 20% correction, Dubai has seen eight of those in the past six years, with each followed by an equally strong bull run. As frontier and upgraded emerging markets grow in importance, as they surely will, volatility will make a return.Four, a crash in corporate earnings. The markets are just a claim on corporate earnings. In the last decade, the share of gross domestic product taken in profits has hit an all-time high. It is above 10% of GDP in the U.S., compared with below 5% for much of the 1980s.When something hits an all-time high, it usually only has one way to go — downwards. But if profits fall, the stock market will go down with it, and so will corporate bonds. And it will happen very fast.In reality, calm is not the natural state for the markets. The wild swings will return very soon — and one of those four trends is the most likely trigger.Also read these stories on MarketWatch:The ‘father of the VIX’ on its 7-year low: Don’t worry about itFive surprises that could derail higher interest rates	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F507F656-06CE-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Banks face added capital requirements	By Viktoria Dendrinou and David EnrichThe changes under consideration by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Switzerland-based group that sets global banking rules, could force banks to raise billions of dollars in extra capital.The Basel Committee is considering new regulations that would reduce banks’ latitude to measure the riskiness of their own assets, a key determinant of how much capital they need to hold, these people said. The panel is looking at barring banks from assigning very low risk levels to certain types of assets, a tactic some lenders have used to reduce their capital requirements, these people said.The potential changes would address two of the most controversial elements of bank accounting. Banks’ treatment of government bonds as without risks became a punch line during Europe’s financial crisis when Greece defaulted on its widely held debts; investors continue to treat some European government bonds as far from risk-free. Meanwhile, banks’ discretion to estimate the riskiness of their own assets has contributed to the perception among many investors that banks’ capital ratios aren’t reliable indicators of their financial health.The question of how banks assess their assets’ risks is pivotal because of how regulators and investors measure lenders’ ability to absorb future losses. A key gauge is the ratio of a bank’s equity to its “risk-weighted” assets. As a bank’s risk-weighted assets decline, its capital ratios rise. Thus, banks have an incentive to play down the riskiness of the loans and securities they hold.For government bonds, the Basel Committee recently has been looking into the possibility of changing the zero-risk policy and instead requiring banks to evaluate their sovereign risks in the same manner as other assets, the people familiar with the discussions said. The talks, which are part of a broader review of the risks arising from banks’ sovereign exposures, are at an early stage and might not result in actual rule changes, these people said.The committee is more likely to propose risk-weighting “floors,” which would set minimum risk weights for certain classes of assets, according to people familiar with the discussions. That could be included in a package of proposals in November, they said.The prospect of both changes already is attracting industry protests.Introducing risk-weighting floors “would have the effect of increasing capital requirements for banks,” said Thomas Huertas, a former top British regulator and now a partner at consultancy EY.Bank executives and some Basel Committee members worry that the existence of floors could prompt banks to shun low-risk loans if they can’t treat them as essentially risk-free.In Italy, where banks are big holders of government debt, industry executives have warned the central bank that it would become less desirable for them to buy such bonds if they didn’t enjoy the risk-free status, according to a person involved in the discussions. That likely would translate into higher borrowing costs for the Italian government, the bankers warned.Elsewhere in Europe, some regulators already have taken steps to limit this practice.In Belgium, KBC Groep NV, the country’s biggest lender by market value, said in May that its risk-weighted assets had climbed by EUR4.4 billion because it had stopped applying zero-percent risk weights to its portfolio of Belgian, Czech, Slovakian and Hungarian government bonds. KBC said it was asked to do so by Belgium’s central bank.A spokeswoman for the National Bank of Belgium confirmed that it asked the country’s lenders to make the change.Banks in other countries are bracing for similar moves. Gernot Mittendorfer, the finance chief at Austria’s Erste Group Bank AG, told analysts recently that he expects government bonds to start being risk-weighted in coming years. “There is a huge amount of debate” about how that will work, he said.Aided in part by generous regulatory treatment, European banks are among the biggest buyers of their governments’ bonds. As of May, euro-zone banks were holding EUR1.8 trillion of such debt, accounting for nearly 6% of their total assets, according to European Central Bank data. Those holdings have been treated as risk-free for capital purposes because of the historically low odds of a government default--an assumption that was badly shaken during the continent’s recent crisis.Basel officials had hoped that increased regulatory scrutiny of how banks calculate their risk weightings would prompt the industry to change its practices voluntarily, but they haven’t seen evidence of that happening, according to a person familiar with the committee’s thinking.Want to read the latest and most interesting stories and analysis to come out of D.C.?

France’s Orange to sell smartphones in U.S. e-store	By Marion HalftermeyerOrange SA /quotes/zigman/189219/delayed FR:ORA -0.09% , formerly known as France Télécom, plans on Monday to launch an e-commerce website to sell smartphones, tablets and other gadgets to U.S. consumers. The website will also sell prepaid SIM cards that work on its French network so tourists going to France will be able to avoid exorbitant roaming costs.The new website is part of a 1 1/2-year effort at the French telecom company to diversify beyond the largely European and African markets, where it owns and operates phone networks and where it has in recent years seen growth stagnate.In the French market, for instance, a brutal price war pushed Orange’s 2013 revenue down 6.6 % to 20 billion euros ($27.3 billion). By contrast, Verizon Communications Inc. /quotes/zigman/262341/delayed/quotes/nls/vz VZ -0.93% , of the U.S., increased revenue more than 4% last year.“In countries where we are an operator, we are faced with more constraints,” said Sébastien Crozier, who runs Orange’s expansion effort. “That makes you think about the necessity of being present in the U.S.”An expanded version of this article appears at WSJ.com .More news from MarketWatch:July 4th weekend was a dud for HollywoodApple, Google may have to lead capex recovery: S&PChina-U.S. business debate: WaPo vs. People’s Daily	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=AE01B540-05C9-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07

China-U.S. business debate: WaPo vs. People’s Daily	By Laura He, MarketWatchThe opening salvo came last week, when the Washington Post wrote about the increasing difficulty for U.S. companies in China, saying the days of “double-digit” profit were over.“A slowdown in China’s breakneck economic growth, stiffer competition from Chinese companies and rising labor costs have combined to cut into the profit margins of U.S. companies operating” in China, said the Post, which is owned by Amazon.com Inc. /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN -2.92%  Chairman Jeff Bezos.In a rarely seen gesture, China’s state-run newspaper People’s Daily on Monday hit back with a report of their own, asserting that the good times for U.S. firms in China “ are far from gone.”In its initial analysis of the Chinese market, the Post had quoted U.S. executives as saying Beijing had tipped the playing field against American companies, favoring domestic Chinese firms and maintaining laws that exclude U.S. players from key sectors of the economy.Likewise, “hazardous levels of air pollution” have made it increasingly difficult for multinational companies to send foreign executives to China, the Post said, quoting Duncan Clark, chairman of investment advisory firm BDA, as saying that “perhaps the golden age for multinationals in China is over.”In its rebuttal, the People’s Daily — the Chinese government’s top official newspaper — said China is still making great efforts to lure foreign investors, and that some of the complaints cited by the Post came as China’s economy enters a major transition period, focusing more on technological innovation and advanced services.“As the economy grows, China is emphasizing quality over quantity regarding foreign investment,” the Chinese newspaper said.Although some foreign companies have relocated their manufacturing bases to the Southeast Asia, where labor costs are relatively lower, China’s service sector “has a craving” for industrial upgrades and increased foreign investment, the newspaper said.For the first five months of this year, China’s service sector employed $27.5 billion in foreign capital, a jump of 19.5% from a year earlier, it said.Really, the People’s Daily said, foreign companies are upset about losing past “preferential treatment,” and the Chinese government is merely trying to “act fairly to all the companies,” whether foreign or domestic.“As the Washington Post acknowledged, ‘enticing opportunities remain — in the established business of selling airplanes, for instance, or partnerships in the movie industry, and in consumer goods and financial services.’” the People’s Daily said.It quoted Ministry of Commerce researcher Mei Xinyu as saying China will always need foreign investment, and specifically, the nation currently seeks “advanced technology, management experience, market opportunity, innovative capability, and top talent” from abroad, with the need particularly strong in the advanced-manufacturing and alternative-energy sectors.Hong Kong political troubles: It’s the peg, stupidMarkets to receive clues about Fed’s views on jobsAwkward schedule, lack of entries leave Hollywood without fireworks	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=671AF9A4-0590-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-07
Hong Kong political troubles: It’s the peg, stupid	By Craig StephenThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reported it intervened to the tune of $2.1 billion to support its pegged currency for the first time in 18 months, seeking to curb the rise of the Hong Kong dollar /quotes/zigman/4867963/realtime/sampled USDHKD +0.0004%  against the greenback.Money should be going in the opposite direction if we listen to the “Big Four” accounting firms. Last week, they collectively took out newspaper advertisements to warn that pro-democracy protests could lead to international businesses and capital leaving Hong Kong.One explanation aired was that investors have been buoyed by the efficiency with which local police rounded-up rogue demonstrators, meaning there was now less to fear about subsequent “Occupy Central” public-disobedience protests.Here’s another interpretation: These fund inflows and heightened levels of social unrest are not coincidental — international capital is placing bets the Hong Kong dollar peg could also be close to the breaking point.It is often assumed the peg cannot be broken on the upside, as the Hong Kong establishment is comfortable with the resultant higher prices, which means higher property revenues. But some investors have argued that there is a breaking point, at which peg-induced higher prices become unbearable to the local population and lead to severe social unrest.We could now be close to that trigger. Mounting evidence suggests that the three-decades-old currency regime lies at the root of so many underlying social, economic and political conflicts in Hong Kong. Initiate reform here, and Beijing can expect the political temperature to cool.Indeed, back in September 2011, Pershing Square hedge-fund manager Bill Ackrman argued in a 150-page presentation that a Hong Kong dollar revaluation would pay political dividends by demonstrating that Beijing was serious about addressing local tensions and the political divide. That divide includes unaffordable property, widening income inequality and a huge influx of bargain-hunting mainland Chinese shoppers playing currency arbitrage.While Ackman has clearly been too early in his call for a 30% currency appreciation, many of his trigger points are not just still in play, but are now even stronger.The peg contributes to high prices through rapid expansion of Hong Kong’s monetary base, imported low short-term rates and the diminished purchasing power of the currency.Today, these factors continue to add to Hong Kong’s pressure cooker of higher prices.Once again, the Hong Kong dollar’s anchor currency — the U.S. dollar /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY +0.0062%  — is undergoing a period of weakness. This means it is punching below its weight in term of purchasing power, which has a large impact on the cost of imports, particularly in the critical food sector, given that Hong Kong imports 90% of its food. Recent statistics show that the lowest-quartile income group already spend 41% of income on food, underlying the political sensitivity.Hong Kong’s weak currency has a particularly magnified impact next to the stronger yuan /quotes/zigman/4869230/realtime/sampled USDCNY -0.0415%   /quotes/zigman/14078821/realtime/sampled USDCNH -0.0599% , as integration with the motherland has accelerated in recent years.Even three years ago, Ackman noted that the depressed local currency was supercharging visitor flows from mainland China and pressuring local prices upwards. Since 2011, those 27 million visitors a year from the mainland have turned into an avalanche of 40 million (or nearly six times the local population) last year. This has proved another headache for Hong Kong’s government, as the territory struggles to cope with such numbers.Meanwhile, the most widely discussed peg distortion from imported low interest rates has been the amplified impact on the property and banking sectors in Hong Kong. Now this is raising new concerns, as its has fuelled a potentially destabilizing surge in cross-border lending.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F4888CB8-057F-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-06

Novak Djokovic beats Roger Federer in epic Wimbledon final	By Steven KutzThe 27-year-old Djokovic, who’s from Serbia, now has seven Grand Slam titles, which ties him with John McEnroe and puts him one behind Andre Agassi. But most of Djokovic’s major titles came before 2012. After winning three of the four Grand Slam tournaments — including Wimbledon — in his career-best year, 2011, Djokovic has struggled in the finals of the majors. Going back to the 2012 French Open, he had lost five of the last six Grand Slam finals he appeared in before Sunday’s victory.At the end of 2013, he hired the former tennis star Boris Becker as his coach to help him change that pattern, and he was clearly relieved after the match, which took nearly four hours. Unlike the women’s final, in which Petra Kvitova beat Eugenie Bouchard in a rout, 6-3, 6-0, both competitors in the men’s final played seemingly as well as they could.“It is a very emotional win, after what I’ve been through mentally to win another Wimbledon trophy,” Djokovic said while talking with ESPN’s analysts after the match. “It is by far the best quality tennis…that I’ve ever been a part of” in a Grand Slam final, he added.It’s doubtful that many who saw the match would disagree. In the first few sets, there was only one service break, as Federer blasted 21 aces and Djokovic hit 49 winners.But after Djokovic won the third set in a tiebreaker, the odds started to favor him a lot: Federer had never come back from being down two sets to one in a Grand Slam final, and Djokovic had never lost after being up two sets to one in a Grand Slam final.Djokovic went up 5-2 in the fourth set, and it seemed to be just about over. But with Djokovic serving for the match at 5-3, Federer broke him, and energized the crowd, many of whom wanted him to win what would have been his record eighth Wimbledon title. Serving at 4-5 and facing a match point, Federer aced Djokovic and went on to win the set 7-5 to force a fifth set.Federer, who’s from Switzerland, has won a record 17 Grand Slam titles in his career. But he hasn’t won one since Wimbledon in 2012. In 2013 he had a back injury that kept him from playing at 100%. This year, he is healthy, and he is using a new racquet with a larger head size (97 square inches) that Wilson designed for him. For years, he had used a 90 square inch racquet while most of his opponents used 98 or larger. ( Also see: The Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay on Federer’s vintage performance )A father of four who will turn 33 next month, Federer was in a position he hadn’t been in for two years: he was just a set away from his 18th Grand Slam title. And despite their age difference, at times he looked like the more fit player in the fifth set. But Djokovic was the steadier player in the last few games and he won it 6-4.“I can’t believe I made it to five [sets]; it wasn’t looking good there for a while,” Federer said after the match.During his post-match interview, Djokovic, who will also be a father soon — his fiancée is six months pregnant — looked toward Federer and said, “Thank you for letting me win today,” before calling him “the most successful player ever.”Also see:Petra Kvitova wins her second Wimbledon title in dominant performance	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=01E3CFCA-0518-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-06
The yellow commodity hotter than gold	By Charles Passy, MarketWatchYou may be showing the world you’re a true trendsetter.In recent years, mustard has been embraced as the “it” condiment by the foodie crowd. Gourmet brands are releasing mustards reflecting a broadening range of styles and incorporating a seemingly endless array of flavors. Among the varieties now on store shelves: Dusseldorf-style mustards (“Move over Dijon,” declared one food writer recently), fruity mustards (blueberry, anyone?) and the super-coarse Tin Mustard (it’s got a texture reminiscent of caviar, say fans).And mainstream manufacturers are getting in on the act, too. French’s, the best-selling brand that’s long been known for its classic yellow variety, now offers Sooo Creamy & Light, a “mild mustard blend” that’s intended to be a health-conscious substitute for mayo (“Mayo has met its match,” French’s touts). As for Kraft-owned Grey Poupon – the brand famous for its iconic “Pardon me, would you have any…” ad” – it has made headlines again for a different kind of commercial: namely, a fake one. Comedians Adam Grimes and Jessica Sattelberger recently produced a potty humor-minded mock ad (unapproved by the brand) that has become a viral sensation . Still, if nothing else, it shows mustard is, well, hot.Mustard also equals money, at least judging by recently available data: The condiment raked in U.S. sales of $508 million in 2012 -- an 11% jump since 2007, according to Mintel, a market researcher. True, mustard doesn’t quite measure up to ketchup in this country (ketchup sales hit $743 million in 2012). But most food industry insiders and experts believe that mustard is positioned to grow in popularity not only because it’s so global (the condiment, which can be traced back to the Romans, is popular in just about every culture and country, from Brazil to Great Britain), but also because it’s naturally healthy. As a recent French’s ad campaign touts, “Farmers make our mustard zero calories, not scientists.”Mustard is also versatile: Sure, it’s the classic topping to the hot dog that’s enjoyed at the ballpark or summer barbecue, but it can just as easily be paired with items ranging from roast beef to soft pretzels or used as a key ingredient in casseroles, dressings and other foodstuffs. Grey Poupon even suggests a turkey gravy for the holidays incorporating its mustard.In short, it’s the condiment of the moment, says chef and restaurateur Alice Price Becker.“Mustard is the new butter, the new mayo,” she says, adding that it’s not unusual these days to hear restaurant patrons “asking for mustard for their bread and their fries.”And as Becker’s experience attests, the condiment’s popularity goes beyond store shelves and home kitchens. Mustard is indeed finding its way into higher-end dining establishments. At the Public House at The Venetian in Las Vegas, executive chef Anthony Meidenbauer has crafted his own bacon-onion mustard as a complement to some of his starters. At the Fairmount Chateau Whistler resort in Canada, mixologists have been known to serve a house cocktail rimmed with crushed mustard seeds.And at Avant at San Diego’s Rancho Bernardo Inn, chef Nicolas Bour is offering a house-made mustard on tap (just like beer, except in smaller quantities). “The mustard is flowing,” Bour says of business at the restaurant.If there were a place where that flow is a veritable mustard monsoon, it would have to be the National Mustard Museum, situated in Middleton, Wisc. (just two-and-half-hours from Chicago or “a mere 6,578 kilometers from Dijon, France,” as the museum touts on its website). Here, curator Barry Levenson, a former Wisconsin assistant attorney general, presides over a showcase of more than 5,500 mustards from all 50 states and 70-plus counties. That is, when he’s not sending mustard by mail through his museum online store or planning the annual world-wide mustard competition (this year’s contest attracted nearly 300 entries).Oh, and don’t forget National Mustard Day on Aug. 2. At the museum, that calls for a big party, highlighted by mustard custard – yes, mustard in ice cream. Barry Levenson says it tastes better than you might suspect. “People really line up for this,” he adds.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5EEDB924-039C-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-04

Treasurys extend fall after weak 10-year note auction	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- The Treasury Department sold $21 billion in 10-year notes /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +1.41% Wednesday at a yield of 2.597%. Bidders offered to buy 2.57 times the amount of debt sold, compared to an average of 2.74 times at the last six sales. Indirect bidders, a group that includes foreign central banks, bought 39.6%, versus 45% in recent sales. Direct bidders, which include domestic money managers, purchased another 13.9%, versus an average of 18.9%. The broader bond market extended its fall after the auction. Yields on 10-year notes, which move inversely to prices, rose 2.5 basis points on the day to 2.588%.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E89C27A9-CDFD-4EBE-ACDD-597AB338DDBF&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Citi near $7 billion deal to resolve mortgage probe	By Andrew Grossman and Daniel FitzpatrickThe two sides, which had been far apart just weeks ago, are now ironing out details of an agreement that would avert a federal lawsuit over the mortgages, these people said. A settlement could be announced as early as next week.The potential settlement marks a sharp reversal from mid-June, when the Justice Department had warned that it planned to file a lawsuit unless Citigroup significantly raised its settlement offer.Citigroup /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C -1.17%   had been offering around $4 billion, while the government was seeking close to $10 billion, a figure the bank found objectionable, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank had argued that its precrisis conduct shouldn’t warrant such a large sum and that it should pay far less than the $13 billion paid in November by J.P. Morgan Chase JPM -1.61% & Co., which packaged and sold far more mortgage securities before the financial crisis, the people said.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Dow 17,000 is on the wrong side of historyHow a big SUV and a home office can cut your tax bill7 market myths that make investors poorer	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=408D7CCE-06E1-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Widodo claims victory in Indonesian presidential election	By Ben Otto and I Made SentanaSeveral independent organizations authorized to count votes at a sampling of voting stations after polls closed showed Widodo with leads ranging from 4.5 to 8.5 percentage points, with more than half their counting complete. The pollster Saiful Muljani Research & Consulting suggested voter turnout was around 70%, down from 75% during legislative polls in April.Widodo said he had won the election, based on the early unofficial results, and urged his supporters to monitor the official count to ensure that it was done smoothly and fairly. Later, Subianto’s campaign dismissed Widodo’s claim of victory and urged the ex-general’s supporters to remain calm.Official results won’t be known until after July 20, but quick counts by independent organizations have enabled roughly accurate projections in the past, including during the April polls.Voters in the world’s third-largest democracy went to the polls to elect their first new president in a decade, to replace outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who will step down in October after 10 years in office.The elections are a milestone in Indonesia’s democratic evolution since former authoritarian ruler Suharto was ousted in 1998, with one directly elected president succeeding another for the first time. In the years after Suharto’s downfall, leaders were chosen by parliament.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.comMore must-reads from MarketWatch:Here are 6 companies set for huge profit gainsSay hello to U.S. economy’s newest bubbleIraq, Syria forced to drink water from the sea	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=897ED858-0748-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
European markets head for fourth day in red	By Sara Sjolin, MarketWatchThe Stoxx Europe 600 index /quotes/zigman/2380150/delayed XX:SXXP -0.40%  gave up 0.3% to 339.12, after posting the biggest loss in four months on Tuesday.The recent losses have come after global stock markets last week traded at or near record highs, creating fears of an asset bubble and spurring concerns that a correction is due. Specifically for Europe, a string of disappointing German data has also highlighted weaknesses in the euro zone’s powerhouse and led to concerns the country is heading toward zero economic growth. Read: Is Germany leading the euro zone toward the no-growth cliff?A dearth of economic data for Europe on Wednesday meant that investors instead focused on key central-bank events. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is due to speak in London in the evening, while Executive Board members Benoît Cœuré and Peter Praet spoke in Athens and Paris, respectively. Praet said the ECB’s targeted long-term refinancing operation will break a vicious spiral of high lending rates for companies, high credit risk and poor economic performance.The main event, however, will be the release of minutes from the Fed’s June meeting due at 7 p.m. London time, or 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is clearly among the doves on the policy-setting committee, and investors are hoping that the minutes will “provide some clarity and reassurance that Yellen can continue to hold sway over her more hawkish colleagues,” Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said in a note. Read: Minutes may shed some light on how and when the Fed will hikeAfter a solid June jobs report out last week, several banks have moved forward their forecast as to when the Fed will introduce the first rate hike.Back in Europe, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 index /quotes/zigman/3173262/delayed UK:UKX -0.67%  suffered one of the biggest setbacks among country-specific indexes, down 0.6% to 6,698.10.

Is this the most expensive car in the world?	By Graham KozakYet they haven’t quite managed to top the auction price record. That could change later this year: Bonhams has announced that one of these rare vehicles — chassis number 3851 GT — will be sold at its Quail auction on Aug. 15.In this originality-crazed market, it doesn’t hurt that the car has been in the same family for the past 49 years. Before entering the ownership of a certain Fabrizio Violati, who reportedly saved it from scrap, it placed second in the 1962 Tour de France, which gets it on the books as a racing contender, at least.Yes, it crashed later that year, leading to the death of driver Henri Oreiller, a morbid fact that probably won’t scare off any bidders. Crashes are not necessarily a blemish on the past of a racing car, and Ferrari repaired it, anyway.Even better: To keep the dream alive for enthusiasts everywhere, Bonhams has announced that the car will cross the block without reserve!Which means that, if every other interested party gets stuck in traffic on the way to the auction — in a cellular dead zone so they can’t phone in their bids — and your crack team of Romanian hackers takes down the entire Internet to preclude virtual paddle-raising, you could snag this exceedingly rare, exceedingly desirable Ferrari for the price of a worn Allante.More likely, though, it’ll attract the attention of the world’s best-heeled collectors and go on to shatter the world record for a car sold at auction. $25 million is practically a given, $30 million a definite possibility, even $50 million is not an unreasonable estimate, barring complete global economic collapse before August, the sky really is the limit here.Recall that, just a few months after Fangio’s Mercedes-Benz W196R hammered for a world record auction price of $29.6 million (in another Bonhams sale, we might add), a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO reportedly sold for $52 million — enough to make that the world’s most expensive car.Of course, the 250 GTO in question (reportedly) left the hands of a private seller only to (reportedly) enter the hands of another private collector, so there’s no way to prove that the sale actually happened at that price. Could have been higher, could have been lower, could have been complete fantasy — it was then, and remains now, completely unsubstantiated.At the time, we asked a few experts what they thought of the alleged transaction, and their answers were relatively consistent: It was certainly within the realm of possibility, given the red-hot auction market and the trajectory of rare Ferraris, but we’ll probably never know for sure unless the buyer or the seller comes forward.This Bonhams sale could officially launch the Ferrari 250 GTO to the head of the public-sale leaderboard, zooming past the Ferrari 250 Testarossa which Gooding unloaded for $16.4 million in 2011, surpassing last year’s $27.5 million Ferrari 275 GTB/4*S NART Spider and even smashing Fangio’s $30 million Silver Arrow.You never know, though. A fortuitous traffic jam or a total breakdown of our society’s technological fabric, and this ever-desirable Italian masterwork could be yours for fractions of pennies on the dollar.You can’t win unless you bid. Bonhams website has more information on the Ferrari and the upcoming Quail auction.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=51EC828E-0205-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

One chart shows the diverging fortunes of U.S. and Europe	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe U.S. 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +0.51%   yield hit its highest level since 1999 relative to 10-year German bond, or bund, /quotes/zigman/15866409/realtime BX:TMBMKDE-10Y -0.58%  yield this week. While the U.S. government bond yield has fallen so far this year, defying the expectations of most investors, German yields have fallen even more sharply. That means the premium the U.S. pays to borrow compared to Germany has been climbing.Since both types of bonds are thought of as safe bets, investors generally buy them up when growth and inflation outlooks are languishing, and central banks are expected to boost efforts to help the economy. But while the latest data suggest Germany could be headed toward the no-growth cliff , the U.S. economy is picking up steam. Inflation in the two countries is also headed in opposite directions.“The European problem is more an inflation problem than a growth problem,” said David Keeble, head of interest-rate strategy at Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank. That helps explain diverging central bank policies where the Federal Reserve is cutting off its super-easy policy known as quantitative easing, and the ECB is starting.On Tuesday, the U.S. 10-year yielded 2.56% while the German 10-year yielded 1.22%. The differential between them was at 1.34 percentage points, within spitting distance of its 15-year high of 1.36 percentage points on Monday, according to Tradeweb.To find a time when the spread was significantly wider than current levels, one has to go back 35 years to an era of skyrocketing U.S. inflation, according to Credit Suisse research.“The divergence of growth and inflation between the U.S. and Europe appears to be on schedule. European inflation should continue to fall as U.S. inflation accelerates,” said Helen Haworth and Ira Jersey of Credit Suisse, in a Tuesday research report.In the U.S., the consumer price index last month was up 2.1% over the past year, its highest level since 2012. There have been five straight months of more than 200,000 new jobs, the first time that has happened since 1999. As those readings pick up, traders expect the Federal Reserve to begin hiking key lending rates around this time next year.Meanwhile, the June reading for inflation in the euro zone was at a measly 0.5%. Growth has been rebounding at various speeds across the euro-zone, though manufacturing and labor market indicators in Germany are trending lower . Amid that backdrop, the European Central Bank has unveiled a package of new stimulus measures aimed at pushing inflation higher.The chart that shows the widening yield gap carries another indicator for yield-hungry investors in an income-starved world. Even though benchmark U.S. Treasurys are yielding less than 3%, they look relatively attractive, at least compared to their German counterparts.And that is a key reason big foreign investors are loading up on good ol’ made-in-the-U.S.A. government bonds, which has helped push yields lower in the first half of the year, and may continue to do so, analysts say. That was reinforced by Tuesday data showing Japanese investors sold German bunds in May while buying U.S. Treasurys.These days, “people are a little more easily convinced to be bullish,” Keeble said.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Weidner: Dow 17,000 is on the wrong side of historyIs Germany leading the euro zone toward the no-growth cliff?Kellner: Say hello to U.S. economy’s newest bubble	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=2073AA54-06B3-11E4-BE59-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Hong Kong stocks suffer on China data, U.S. losses	By Laura He, MarketWatchChina’s consumer-price index rose 2.3% in June from a year ago moderating from a 2.5% year-over-year increase in May and slightly below than the 2.4% gain projected in separate Dow Jones News Wires and Reuters surveys of economists.

If ever the stock market flashed a ‘sell’ signal, it’s now	By Michael SincereMost investors seem to feel pretty confident that this market will never go down. But if you’ve studied bear markets, you know how this story will end.Don’t forget: Human nature never changes.At the point of maximum giddiness (or pain if you’re short), the market always teaches investors a costly lesson. Right now, investors are chasing yield, but all it takes is one bad day to wipe out a year’s worth of gains.Sentiment indicators such as Investors Intelligence are at historic highs (that is bearish), and the RSI Wilder indicator is telling us the market is seriously overbought. Yes, the market can still go higher, but it’s on borrowed time.Don’t believe me? When you are standing 17,000 points in the air at the top of Dow Mountain, and the market is priced for perfection, there is nowhere to go but down.Inflation has nowhere to go but upAlthough the market still has room to rise, so do interest rates. In fact, the odds are very good that interest rates will creep higher, and this will affect bonds and stocks.There is also an 800-pound gorilla in the room, and that is inflation. Shoppers already know that inflation is spreading. For example, cereal boxes are getting smaller while prices are rising. The price of orange juice and other commodities are skyrocketing. I could give a dozen more examples. The Fed seems to want inflation, as if it’s desirable. Here’s what I say to the Fed: Be careful what you wish for.Playing the oddsHere’s how the market odds look to me: At the most, the upside is 5% or 10%, while the downside is potentially 25% or 30%. I’m not saying the market is going to fall that much, but in previous bear markets that’s exactly what happened (or worse) over several months or years.Like the game of three-card monte, while most investors are celebrating the all-time highs, prudent investors are looking underneath the hood. For example, the number of stocks making new highs is shrinking every week. And the stocks that are making new highs are not leading stocks, but many unknowns. That’s a red flag.Ignore history at your perilMany professional money managers have never experienced a crash or bear market. That means that during the next bear market, they’re going to stick to what they know best: buy and hold. If it’s a particularly vicious bear market, they’ll be looking for new clients while their former clients eat leftovers.By the way, for those who believe it’s different this time because of the Fed, a bear market is coming. It always does (on average every 3.4 years since 1929). Right now, millions of investors think the market is bullet-proof. After all, for five years they have ridden the coattails of a Fed-induced bull market. Now, every bullish investor seems like a genius, but that won’t last much longer.It’s not fun being on the losing teamWith help from the Fed, the market is soaring, thrilling the bulls, who celebrate with party hats and hubris. The only thing different this time is the Fed has delayed the inevitable, but that won’t last forever.The bears in a bull market are party-poopers, the designated driver, the boy who cried wolf. Bears are taunted and despised. But bears are also the ones who survive after a severe correction or unexpected crash.Do you feel lucky? It will take more than luck to survive what is coming our way.Michael Sincere (www.michaelsincere.com) is the author of “Understanding Options,” “Understanding Stocks,” and “Predict the Next Bull and Bear Market and Win.”More from Michael Sincere:U.S. market running on ‘hot air and inertia’Were all pawns in the stock markets shell gameStocks are telling you a bear market is coming	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=302D497E-06EE-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
10 top stock funds with a secret to success	By Conrad de AenlleStudy after study has confirmed this view. It’s hard to argue against evidence like that. Or is it?A concept that has gained favor in the last few years is “active share” — a measure of the extent to which a fund’s holdings differ from those in its benchmark index.Research conducted at Yale University by Martijn Cremers and Antti Petajisto found a relationship between stock funds’ active share and performance. The more stock-picking managers do, the better their long-run return.Fund wonks may detect a similarity between active share and “tracking error,” but there’s an important distinction. Tracking error refers to the deviation in a fund’s performance from its benchmark, while active share explicitly looks at its holdings.It’s possible to have high active share and low tracking error by picking different stocks from those in the index, but sticking with similar weightings in sectors or tilts in growth versus value styles. Conversely, a portfolio that mimics the index but with greatly different sector weightings, say, would have low active share and high tracking error.An interesting finding by Cremers and Petajisto is that funds with high active share tend to have low- to moderate tracking error. That suggests the managers are beating both peers and market benchmarks primarily through stock-picking skill, but it also raises a conundrum: If most active managers generally can’t beat index funds, how come the most active ones can?There are two possibilities. Funds with high active share tend to be concentrated. Perhaps it’s a package deal: the best stock pickers may have more confidence to back their best ideas fully.Probably a more critical factor is that funds with low active share are little more than so-called closet-index trackers, whose portfolios hew close to the benchmark but have management fees on par with truly active funds. A study published last year that Petajisto did at New York University (he now works in the multi-asset strategies group at BlackRock Inc.) found that closet indexers — actively managed funds in the bottom quintile in active share — underperformed their benchmarks by 0.91% a year between 1990 and 2009. Stock-picking funds in the top quintile in active share beat their benchmarks by an annualized 1.26%.“The performance of closet indexers has been predictably poor,” Petajisto wrote, summarizing his findings. “They largely just match their benchmark index returns before fees, and so after fees, they lag behind their benchmarks by approximately the amount of their fees. . . . However, one group has added value for investors: the most active stock pickers.”Finding those most active stock pickers isn’t easy. Active share isn’t one of the usual yardsticks to assess fund results. But investment researcher Morningstar Inc. assembled a list of U.S. stock funds that get its top rating of five stars and feature high active share and strong five-year returns.There are 10 five-star funds that rank in the top 10% on both active share and returns within their subgroup — smaller companies, large-capitalization value and so on. The list was compiled this way because active share tends to vary across categories, as does performance.Five of the funds specialize in larger companies: Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators (IWIRX) /quotes/zigman/324231/realtime IWIRX -0.94%  ; Johnson Enhanced Return /quotes/zigman/481910/realtime JENHX -0.45%  ; Marsico Flexible Capital /quotes/zigman/447715/realtime MFCFX -1.29%  ; Pimco Fundamental IndexPlus /quotes/zigman/386952/realtime PIXAX -0.56%   and Pimco StocksPlus Absolute Return /quotes/zigman/331710/realtime PSPTX -0.54%  .Four of the other five are small-cap funds: Allianz Ultra Micro-Cap /quotes/zigman/594190/realtime AUMIX -1.57%  ; AMG Southern Sun Small-Cap /quotes/zigman/34730861/realtime SSSFX -0.82%  ; Pimco Small-Cap StocksPlus /quotes/zigman/417166/realtime PSCSX -1.09%   and the generically named Small Cap Value /quotes/zigman/398041/realtime SCAPX -0.71%  . The final entry, despite its name, is a mid-cap blend fund, Longleaf Partners Small-Cap /quotes/zigman/140247/realtime LLSCX -0.31%  .No investor should buy a fund simply because it has a high active share; there’s more to successful performance than being an iconoclastic stock picker. But these 10 also have strong long-term returns relative to others with the same investment objective, so they’ve demonstrated that their stock picks are not just different, but better.More investing news from MarketWatch:7 market myths that make investors poorerTake stock of your money and investing successYoure not talking about money nearly enough	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8BDF175E-06D8-11E4-BD5F-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Smartphone dependency fuels other addictions, say rehab clinics	By Quentin Fottrell, MarketWatch“The smartphone is the tool that helps exacerbate that addiction or it’s a tool they use not to deal with that addiction,” says Joel Edwards, executive director of Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach, Calif. And with good reason: Roughly 169 million Americans owned a smartphone in May — a 70% penetration rate — market research group comScore found, and nearly two-thirds of people in their late 20s live in households with no landlines, according to data released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We’re dealing with more and more smartphones as part of the underlying issues. These technologies are driving addictions faster and with more intensity than ever before,” Edwards says.Mobile devices help provide the three A’s — accessibility, affordability and anonymity, says Robert Weiss, senior vice president of clinical development for Elements , a national behavioral health company. “In 1988, you had to drive to an icky place for pornography and hope that nobody saw you,” he says. “Now, you just say, ‘Siri, show me the porn.’” Drug dealers will know an online message — “I’m in Newport Beach looking for tar or 420” — refers to black tar heroin and cannabis, Edwards adds, but those code words for drugs will go over the heads of most people. “Even a drug dealer has to take a nap occasionally, but it’s easy for people to connect with others to support that addiction,” he says.Smartphones are also playing a central role in behavioral addictions like gaming, social networking, pornography and sex, says Hilarie Cash, co-founder of Restart Life , a recovery retreat center in Fall City, Wash. Restart Life treats males over 18 years of age and provides a retreat away from digital media for 35 to 90 days, helping them improve their social skills. About 95% of the addictions Restart Life deals with relate to gaming, Cash says, but there are often other issues like pornography and social networking mixed in. “With a smartphone you can do that all the time,” she says. Weiss agrees. “The last cultural revolution took place on the streets,” he says, “but this one is a lot quieter.”Also see: Does Facebook break up marriages?Young people are particularly at risk, and not just those who have addictions, says Cole Rucker, co-founder and CEO of Paradigm Malibu , an adolescent mental health and drug abuse treatment center. “Years ago, the most difficult part for them here was that they couldn’t smoke cigarettes and now the biggest challenge is they can’t have their cellphones,” he says. Teenagers suffering from depression or anxiety often use smartphones as a coping skill rather than learning to sit with their emotions and developing relationships, Rucker says. “Very often, cellphone use is just like drug use, another negative coping style, and a way to avoid thoughts and feelings,” he adds.Although smartphones can prevent people from dealing with anxiety, they may also compound it. Those who are heavy smartphone users can’t go 10 minutes without their phone before suffering from anxiety, according to one recent study co-authored by Larry Rosen, professor of psychology at California State University and author of “iDisorder: Understanding Our Obsession with Technology and Overcoming Its Hold on Us.” The study is due to be published in the August 2014 edition of the journal “ Computers in Human Behavior .” “Most people can’t last an hour without getting highly anxious if their smartphone is taken away,” says Rosen.His researchers split a group of 163 college students into light, moderate and heavy smartphone users. Half the students sat in silence without their phones and half with them turned off and out of sight. Regardless of where their phone was, the light users showed no increase in anxiety for the entire 75 minutes, the moderate users showed a slight increase between 10 and 20 minutes, but the heavy users showed more anxiety than the light users at the 10-minute mark, and their anxiety continued to rise until the experiment ended. “Most young people, who are among the heaviest users of their smartphones, can’t last an hour without getting highly anxious if their smartphone is taken away,” he says.Also see: You killed me at hello: 26% of car wrecks involve phonesOf course, smartphones typically facilitate existing addictions or underlying emotional problems rather than cause them. “They may be addicted to sexual content on their phone or gaming on their phone in the same way that people are addicted to gambling rather than casinos,” Weiss says. “There is no treatment for cellphone addiction or Internet addiction.” The basic criteria for figuring out whether you have a problem includes whether your behavior interrupts with your work, family life, beliefs or life goals, and has negative consequences. “People don’t become addicted without some underlying deficit,” Weiss says. “They have a need to find something that is not in their life in another place.”That said, there’s also a growing body of research supporting “nomophobia” — the fear of being without your cellphone. Nearly half of Americans (47%) say they couldn’t go a day without their smartphone, according to a survey released last week by Bank of America. One-in-five people reach for their phone as a 21st Century replacement for the post-coital cigarette, according to a 2012 report from mobile security company LookOut, and 41% of people said losing their iPhone would be “a tragedy,” according to a 2010 Stanford University poll. “I have really bad anxiety if I can’t get to my phone,” says Kevin Raposo, 30, a technology blogger in Boston. “I leave it within hands’ reach by my bedside.”It isn’t always clear when dependence on a smartphone has become a problem. The counselors at Morningside Recovery try to find out what need smartphones are filling and find a way to replace that through group therapy, journaling, and walking in nature. “We put our clients in front of a group of people and actually have them carry on a conversation,” Edwards says. While anxiety and depression could be the main problems, the issue could also be due to loneliness or work-related stress — for example, when a father checks his office emails while sitting at the dinner table, he says. And the consequences of smartphone dependence can be just as dire as a substance dependence. “Texting while driving and drinking while drinking is the same kind of crazy,” Edwards says.Other articles by Quentin Fottrell:Cocaine use is going to potTreating hangovers is now a billion-dollar industryLonely people share too much on Facebook10 things psychologists won’t tell you	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=230EA864-075C-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Thanks for going Dutch, America	By Almar LatourMany of you are probably busy eating chunks of Gouda cheese while brushing up on your Dutch language skills to better express your emotions during today’s World Cup semifinal between Holland and Argentina.The enormous outpouring of support for the Oranje by U.S. fans in the last week has left me to conclude that my plea to you to throw your support behind the Netherlands was most persuasive. Fantastisch!Now please park your bike for a moment to ponder just how Orange-minded you really are: The call to go Dutch was met with thousands of tweets, tens of thousands of Facebook posts and hundreds of thousands of readers on MarketWatch and at WSJ.com, where the story held the No. 1 most-read spot for three days, making it one of the most popular sports stories of the year.Most responses were simple, like “Go, Orange” or “I agree!” The U.S. Embassy in The Hague tweeted, “OK, we’re convinced,” in response to the column. As we say in Holland: awesome.Your feet will start to itch in your clogs when you hear the following: There was some resistance against the Orange. Shockingly, fans of opposing teams politely pointed out that other countries also had a lot in common with the U.S. For example, one reader argued that American soccer-fan gear could also be redeployed to support Les Bleus because, like the American flag, le drapeau tricolore is also red, white and blue. While perfectly plausible at the time, reality has taken that option off the table. Je regrette.There was another stream of complaints. These can be summed up by one reader’s observation: “DIVERS GET NO LOVE” — a response to the controversy surrounding Arjen Robben’s alleged theatrics on the field. I’ll refrain from comment, except to add that sometimes divers do score goals.Some of you called for more Dutch factoids. If you can handle it between bites of herring, here are a few more: The New York City flag is orange, white and blue because of historic connections to Holland. And, yes, the Pilgrims indeed left from the Netherlands, where they lived over a period of about a dozen years in the city of Leiden. On the voyage that eventually brought them to these parts, they first took a boat named Speedwell, then switched to the Mayflower in England. The Leiden American Pilgrim Museum estimates that about 80 passengers on the vessel originally departed from the Netherlands, roughly 50 of them documented passengers plus about 30 servants.Earlier, I thanked the U.S. for freeing the Netherlands. Some readers pointed out that Canadian units fought hard for the country’s liberation. We’ll forever be grateful for their courage. That does not take away from America’s role in ending oppression back then, so let me thank the U.S. again for that.But enough about history. On to World Cup soccer. For the Dutch that will be at least through the day Wednesday. Longer, I hope.Maybe we’ll talk again. Until such time, I’d like to say just two words:Dank U.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=555A9C76-075F-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Dow 17,000 is on the wrong side of history	By David Weidner, MarketWatchBut more than any modern bull market, this one stands alone in that it’s squarely out of step with economic growth. It’s being driven higher by just a few wealthy participants and traders who have tacitly, perhaps even unknowingly, agreed to drive prices higher.The main reason for that is two-fold.First, low interest rates have made other investments unattractive. The 10-year U.S. Treasury /quotes/zigman/15866666/realtime BX:TMUBMUSD10Y +0.50% is yielding only 2.58%. Inflation is running at an annual rate of 2%. That makes corporate bonds, certificates of deposit (which yield less than T-bills) and other fixed-income products largely a losing proposition. Those who have been buying bonds have been doing so for safety.Second, the investing public isn’t really buying stocks. A study by the Pew Research Center, published in May, found stock ownership by households is shrinking, at 45%, down from more than 65% in 2002. Even with the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA -0.69% reaching the 17,000 milestone, investors are leaving stock mutual funds, not buying them.This series of circumstances is unique. Unlike central bankers’ response to the Great Depression, the Federal Reserve has embraced Keynesian economics and flooded the economy with dollars on a scale never seen before. The Fed’s balance sheet has more than quadrupled to $4.3 trillion since 2008.In short, stocks have become more attractive not because of a surging economy or strengthening corporate profits, but because they are the last-place finishers in an ugly contest. That’s a significant difference with boom markets of the past.For instance, between 1935 and 1937, the stock market lagged an economic recovery. U.S. gross domestic product rose 10.8% in 1934 and 8.9% in 1935. But stocks only took off in that last year, eventually logging a 132% increase until 1937. In that last year, economic growth was robust, but it came crashing down in 1938. GDP contracted 3.3%, and deflation added to woes, with prices falling 2.8%.The next long-term bull market occurred from 1942 to 1946, when stocks jumped more than 150%. That isn’t a good comparison, given the nation’s involvement in World War II. But there were some robust years economically. And once again, the market moved along with the economy: a 17.7% growth rate in 1941, followed by 18.9% in 1942, 17% in 1943 and 8% in 1944. Much of the growth was offset by inflation (9% in 1942), but at least investors had a reason to buy.The first post-war bull market began in 1949 and lasted nearly seven years. Stocks rose more than two-fold as U.S. GDP grew at least 4.1% in each of those years, including an 8.7% growth rate in 1950. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finally passed its 1920s record high in 1954. Inflation was all over the map. Prices rose 8.7% in 1951, but increased at about 1% or lower between 1953 and 1956.The mid-1980s bull market saw stocks, as measured by the S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX -0.70% , double during a five-year period beginning in 1982. Like the current bull market, gains were made to seem bigger after the S&P 500 dropped to only 102.42 in the summer of 1982. But again, there was economic growth that exceeded historical levels — between 3.5% and 7.3% during the rally — and inflation and unemployment fell during that time.Some describe the period from 1987 to 2002 as a bull market. Technically, it may be. It rose more than 500% during that span. But the real bull market of this era occurred between the start of 1995 until early 2000. Stocks in the S&P 500 rose 237% as GDP increased between 3.8% and 4.8% annually. Inflation was low, between 1.6% and 3%. Unemployment fell each year, starting at 5.6% and ending at 4%. Yes, some of this gain was fueled by unrealistic expectations about dot-com companies, but there was real economic growth underneath it too.In all of those periods, the market reflected strong economic trends: solid growth, high or strengthening employment and stable inflation. Only the latter is present today. The unemployment rate is improving, but it’s still a relatively high 6.1%. The best GDP rate produced since the financial crisis was 2.8%. That was in 2012, before the current bull market really took off.Perhaps, as some suggest, this is a new normal. If so, it represents a disconnect between economic reality and market valuation. More likely, it’s a warped market distorted by the extraordinary measures used to create an economic lift.As market indexes touch new highs, investors should ask themselves if they’re taking part in a history-making rally, or a rally that is ignoring history.More from MarketWatch:Why trading volume is tumbling, explained in 5 chartsAre these the dumbest investing ideas you’ve ever heard?Markets to receive clues about Fed’s views on jobs	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=97350948-05E7-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Lufthansa to cut capacity, offset lower costs on long haul	By Robert Wall“We are now seeking to tap new growth areas by creatively and innovatively refining our products and services,” said Lufthansa /quotes/zigman/184134/delayed DE:LHA +1.86%   Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, who took the job on May 1 after previously running the group’s airline and cargo units. “Our market is no place for half measures.”Lufthansa last month warned its Score restructuring plan--which began in 2012--would fail to deliver the EUR2.65 billion ($3.61 billion) operating profit target for 2015 as the airline cut its earnings outlook for this year by 33% to about EUR1 billion and next year’s to EUR2 billion. The airline, which Wednesday confirmed that outlook, said lower yields on trans-Atlantic flights and a pilot strike were among the causes of the weakness.The Score program will become a permanent fixture, Spohr said.As a quick fix, the carrier this year will curb capacity growth by 50% from earlier plans and take aircraft out of service on its European network, inter-continental routes, and cargo business. A total of 10 planes will be removed in the coming winter period, the airline said.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:If ever the stock market flashed ‘sell’, it’s now10 companies that own nearly all the foodSmartphone dependency fuels other addictions	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=34636E46-0762-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

4 reasons conservatives love global warming, won’t stop it	By Paul B. Farrell, MarketWatchAmerica’s leaders are failing us, will never act, till it’s too late to plan for an economic catastrophe. We have lost our soul.There are four big reasons our leaders will not act in time: First. Overwhelming opposition by the GOP, conservatives and capitalists ... Second. Our blind failure to see our planet cannot feed the 10 billion people predicted by 2050. ... Third. Our addiction to “more is never enough” consumption ... Fourth. The irrational, unscientific and ultimately self-destructive belief of capitalism in perpetual economic growth, on a planet of finite resources.We know most will continue believing in all four, trapped in denial. Eventually reality will expose our fantasies, but not soon enough. Global warming will continue causing irreparable damage, destroying our world, pushing us past the point of no return and driving us into a “chaotic era” where few humans will survive.Here are the details, the four reasons why we’re now an addicted nation that can’t stop self-destructing as we’ve reached a critical mass that’s sabotaging all efforts to stop global warming:Conservative opposition is everywhere, emanating from the economic fears of the energy industry, Big Oil, coal, gas, other polluters. They fear regulation and taxation of carbon emissions will have a major negative impact on their corporate earnings, shareholder dividends and will increase production costs, limit access to resources.They spend hundreds of millions lobbying politicians and it works. California Gov. Jerry Brown says there’s “virtually no Republican” in Washington that accepts climate science and most GOP governors “openly deny climate science,” despite widespread scientific evidence.Worldwide, conservative leaders like Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott celebrated the repeal of his country’s carbon-emission tax, despite the increasing damage to his country’s environment and over the unanimous objections from Anglican Church leaders opposing repeal .In fact, even as the new U.S. EPA regulations were announced, Abbott was touring the world to create a “conservative alliance among ‘like-minded’ countries, aiming to dismantle global moves to introduce carbon pricing and undermine a push by America to push the case for action through forums such as the G20.”Conservatives are getting even stronger, neutralizing efforts by power-players like Michael Bloomberg, Hank Paulson, billionaire Tom Steyner and their “RiskyBusiness.org” project intended to educate businesses and politicians on the real costs and “economic risks from the impacts of a changing climate.” Intense opposition from conservative capitalists like the Koch Bros. is also there to blunt Risky Business and similar climate-science advocates.And what about Obama’s new EPA regulations? The impact will be watered down, much as conservatives did with big bank regulations after the 2008 disaster. Plus, global warming regs will kick in too slowly, get watered down by Big Oil lobbyists. Moreover, in spite of all the scientific evidence, sadly, surveys reveal widespread public apathy about future damage to the planet. It’s not a big motivator for most. What is? Cheap gas for their cars is a higher priority.The United Nations predicts global population will exceed 10 billion by 2050, adding three billion more human beings in one short generation, on a planet of rapidly dwindling resources. Plus science is already warning us we cannot feed everybody. In his new book, “The Countdown,” Alan Weisman, author of an earlier bestseller, “World Without Us,” asks the taboo question no politician can ask: “How many people can our planet hold?”Weisman’s answers are deadly: What if science confirms that a “sustainable population is even less than the 7 billion we already number ... how do we design an economy for a shrinking, and then a stable one, meaning, an economy that can prosper without depending on constant growth?” Weisman also offers a solution: “Social objections aside, if the entire world adopted a one-child policy” then by 2100, we’d “be back to 1.6 billion, our population in 1900.” But politicians will be silent ... till it’s too late.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=10F4B284-06D7-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

U.S.-China talks show tension — and potential for progress	By Laura He, MarketWatchAs U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew joined their Chinese counterparts in kicking off the sixth round of the nations’ Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED), there was clearly some tension.Reflecting this, Chinese President Xi Jinping felt the need to urge peace between Washington and Beijing when he addressed the opening ceremony of the dialogue Wednesday morning.“If any confrontation occurred between China and the U.S., it would definitely be a disaster to both countries and the whole world,” Xi said. “China, more than anytime else, needs a stable environment.”Kerry too stressed the need for cordial relations, saying the U.S. was not seeking to “contain” China, and repeating the U.S. mantra that it welcomes “the emergence of a peaceful, stable, prosperous China”, according to remarks carried by Reuters.Lew took a similar tone in his own comments: “We do not always agree, but our strong common interests are far more important than the individual challenges that we confront as a part of our overall bilateral relationship.”The remarks from both sides emphasized rapprochement, as the countries have found disagreement on a wide range of issues over recent months.These include U.S. allegations of Chinese military officers hacking U.S. companies’ data, growing territorial disputes between China and its neighbors, and political tensions in Hong Kong, where tens of thousands of people participated in a massive pro-democracy protest on July 1.The situation was enough to prompt former U.S. Treasury and S&ED veteran David Dollar to tell The Wall Street Journal that “”There seems to be a downward spiral in the relationship” between the U.S. and China.But if the geopolitical situation was a source of tension, agreement appeared more possible for some trade issues, specifically due to China’s decision to welcome its U.S. visitors by announcing plans to increase market access.On Tuesday, China’s official government website published a decree by the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, saying it would expand its “negative list” policy.While China currently restricts foreign investment to only certain industries, its newly established Shanghai Free Trade Zone has allowed global investors to buy into all sectors except for a few on a so-called negative list.In its Tuesday announcement, the State Council said this policy would now be expanded to include the entire country, a move widely seen as significantly increasing access to China’s markets.The State Council also reiterated its stance on letting “markets play a decisive role in allocating resources” and boost entrepreneurship and job creation by lowering entry barriers to those seeking to do business in China.China’s inflation eases (for now), leaving room for stimulusShaolin monks to create kung fu mobile app10 companies that put nearly all the food on supermarket shelves	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0FD79A40-0724-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

EU begins questioning Facebook rivals on WhatsApp deal	By Sam SchechnerOfficials at the European Commission--the EU’s central competition authority--have in recent weeks sent detailed questionnaires to several major technology and online-messaging firms, asking about the merger’s impact on competition in their markets, according to people familiar with the matter.The questionnaires also drill down into a relatively new area for merger reviews: how the firms control and use personal data when they offer services, some of the people said.The commission’s questioning of rivals comes before the EU opens a formal merger review that will provide one of the first in-depth looks at the app economy and social media through the lens of competition law, antitrust lawyers and technology executives say.While authorities have previously reviewed deals with instant and video messaging, such as Microsoft Corp.’s /quotes/zigman/20493/delayed/quotes/nls/msft MSFT -0.31%   purchase of Skype, they have yet to weigh in on any big deals involving those tools in the context of social media.An expanded version of this story appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:If ever the stock market flashed ‘sell’, it’s now10 companies that own nearly all the foodSmartphone dependency fuels other addictions	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5928BB90-0768-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Oil down for 9th straight session as Libya output returns	By William L. Watts, MarketWatchOn the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.78%  fell 20 cents, or 0.2%, to $103.20 a barrel. On ICE, August Brent /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -0.39%  shed 12 cents, or 0.1%, to $108.82 a barrel.The Wall Street Journal reported that Libya’s largest oil field, Sharara, is resuming production and could reach two-thirds of its 340,0000 barrel-a-day capacity by the end of Wednesday.“The supply risks that have been supporting oil prices for months are continuing to abate. ... Together with the two largest oil terminals that have now reopened in the east of the country, Libya could thus increase its production volume by more than 800,000 barrels per day even in the near future,” said strategists at Commerzbank in a note.“This should be sufficient to offset the anticipated growth in the call on OPEC in the second half of the year, thereby assuaging any fears of tightening supply,” Commerzbank said.In product markets, August gasoline futures /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 -0.83%  fell 1.8 cents to $2.9548 a gallon, while August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821453/delayed HOQ4 -0.35%  was down a half cent at $2.8679.

3-year Treasury yield tops 1% for first time since 2011	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe shorter-term yield, which is sensitive to shifts in expectations about Federal Reserve monetary policy, has been on the rise as investors recalibrate forecasts toward earlier hikes to the central bank’s key lending rates.The Fed is set to release minutes of its last policy meeting at 2 p.m. Eastern, which may shed light on how the central bank is thinking about when and how it will lift rates.

Cupcakes are everything that’s wrong with America	By Al LewisIt worked for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. /quotes/zigman/258030/delayed/quotes/nls/kkd KKD -0.06% in the 2000s. It’s working for Crumbs Bake Shop Inc. /quotes/zigman/35808413/delayed/quotes/nls/crmb CRMB -12.50% today.The cupcake chain said Monday that it is closing all 48 of its stores in 10 states and the District of Columbia. It said it was “attending to the dislocation of its devoted employees.” It said it is considering its remaining options, including filing for bankruptcy.Crumbs was a tiny company, as publicly traded companies go, but it was a giant in the cupcake industry.It has amassed more than $19 million in debt, whipping up treats not too far off from what you could have made yourself, as a child, in your Easy-Bake Oven.Some observers have seized on Crumbs’ impending demise to declare the end of the Cupcake Era.This is an absurdity layered onto an absurdity. With way too much frosting.Cupcakes — also known as patty cakes — go back to at least the 1700s. They’ll likely be around in the 2700s. What’s the big deal?I hate cupcakes. They are more than just a symbol of all that is wrong with America. They represent millions of calories and truckloads of white flour and refined sugar that most Americans do not need.We are in the throes of a full-blown obesity crisis, which has sparked a full-blown health-care crisis. Diabetes, heart disease, cancer and oversized people everywhere. And the free-market solution is cupcakes?Cupcakes offer self-indulgence for the self-absorbed. They are the perfect treat for narcissists and psychopaths. They are not meant to be shared. If you only talk to others through texts and tweets, a cupcake may be the perfect sugar rush for you.This may be why cupcakes have been so popular: smartphone for one hand, cupcake for the other.I was actually delighted each time the former Hostess filed for bankruptcy.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E4266AEA-06E0-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Crumbs Bake Shop throws in the towel	By Sara Randazzo“Regrettably Crumbs has been forced to cease operations and is immediately attending to the dislocation of its devoted employees while it evaluates its limited remaining options,” the company said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal. Those options could include a bankruptcy filing, the spokeswoman said.Kareem Wegman, a manager in a Crumbs /quotes/zigman/35808413/delayed/quotes/nls/crmb CRMB -22.50%  store in Brooklyn, told the Journal that a fellow employee broke the news of the closure to him. “I come into work today, I’m happy, I’m skipping to work, and suddenly I don’t have a job,” said Wegman, who has worked at the store for two years and said he has a family to support.Crumbs went public three years ago at the height of the gourmet-cupcake boom. Since then, its financial outlook has grown bleak amid several years of losses, a dwindling cash supply, and a food craze that is petering out.It currently has 48 stores in 10 states and the District of Columbia, according to its website.In March, Crumbs said it closed nine underperforming stores during the last three months of 2013, shut six at the start of 2014 and had more closures on the way.The Nasdaq Stock Market suspended trading of Crumbs shares July 1, citing the company’s failure to meet a requirement of either having at least $2.5 million in shareholder equity or meeting benchmarks for its market cap or annual net profit.Crumbs made its mark selling 4-inch, frosting-laden cupcakes in flavors such as cookie dough, caramel macchiato and red velvet cheesecake, costing generally $3.50 to $4.50 each. A single cupcake can top 600 calories.But the popularity of high-end cupcakes—embodied by chains such as New York’s Magnolia Bakery and Los Angeles–based Sprinkles—has waned in recent years, even as new players crowded into the field. Crumbs posted a loss of $18.2 million last year, layered on a loss of $10.3 million in 2012, according to securities filings. Its cash on hand fell to $893,000 at the end of 2013, down from $6.3 million the prior year.An extended version of this report appears at WSJ.com.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C83A182C-0663-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-08

Real Goods Solar down 5% on downgrade	By Claudia Assis, MarketWatchReal Goods Solar /quotes/zigman/109405/delayed/quotes/nls/rgse RGSE -2.36%  stock fell 5.3%, one of the few to see red as most solar and renewable-energy stocks rose after a two-day, broad-market skid.The U.S.-China trade dispute has already pushed prices of solar modules higher, and Real Goods just announced a module supply deal with U.S.-based SolarWorld, “implying it will be paying higher costs for modules made in the U.S.,” the Cowen analysts, led by Robert W. Stone, said. It is unlikely that the company will find a way to offset the price premium, they added.The analysts cut the stock to market perform from outperform, and lowered their price target on the stock to $2.60 from $3.50.Last month, the U.S. government imposed new, steep anti-subsidies tariffs on Chinese solar panels, which have fueled the boom in residential solar-power systems. A separate decision on dumping of Chinese solar products is expected in late July.Real Goods rose about $7 million last week in a private share placement, and that should be “adequate” to cover its operations through mid 2016 “but higher input costs and a weak balance sheet are likely to hamper the shares,” the Cowen analysts said.In a separate report, Cowen increased its price target on SunPower Corp. /quotes/zigman/7312465/delayed/quotes/nls/spwr SPWR +2.70%  to $50 from $40. SunPower is “well positioned” to gain market share if trade barriers to Chinese-made solar modules alter the U.S. market.SunPower also has a broad reach, operating in the residential, commercial, and utility markets, and its geographic exposure includes fast-growing markets for solar such as China and Japan as well as countries in South America and the Middle East, the analysts said.SunPower shares rose 1.1%. Other gainers in the sector included SolarCity Corp. /quotes/zigman/13139813/delayed/quotes/nls/scty SCTY +1.64% , with shares up 0.1%, and First Solar Inc. /quotes/zigman/102025/delayed/quotes/nls/fslr FSLR +0.70% , up 0.3%.More from MarketWatch:Here’s what Tesla owners are doing when the rest of us sleepIf ever the stock market flashed ‘sell’, it’s now	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9E49E33E-0772-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Solving the mystery of asset allocation	By Bill GundersonBut along the way, investors would have had to endure some really big drops in their nest eggs. During the 2001-2002 bear market spurred by the bursting of the technology bubble, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined almost 80%. Thirteen years later, the Nasdaq has still not recovered all that value. The S&P 500 Index fared better, down only 37% peak to trough during that same bear market period. But the magnitude of those declines was difficult to stomach.Investors finally regained their appetite for stocks back by 2007. The S&P 500 Index made headlines by crossing the 1500 mark, finally peaking at 1576. Just six months later, the stock market would retreat to 666.76, the victim of the global financial crisis and the Great Recession that followed. Compounding the effect of the bear market of 2008-2009 was the fact that most investors not only saw their portfolios get cut in half, but they also lost most, if not all,the equity in their homes.The S&P 500 did not get back to 1500 until January of 2013, taking six years to recover. Now here we are back hitting new all-time highs for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This is both a cause for celebration and a reason to worry. At some point in time, the markets will top out yet again and another bear market will hit. If only there was a way to see a bear coming and hibernate in a cave until it passes.I make no guarantees, claims, or promises going forward, but this was one of the main reasons that caused me to develop my Best Stocks Now app. It was during the 2007-2008 bear market that I started working on the app in hopes of devising a better way to invest and defend against bear market periods.One thing that I experienced during that time was that asset classes behave quite differently during bear-market periods. The bond market /quotes/zigman/1480195/delayed/quotes/nls/tlt TLT -0.05%  was up 32% in 2008, while the stock market traded down 38%.

Wells Fargo earnings could be a warning	By Thomas H. Kee Jr.Since 2009, Wells Fargo /quotes/zigman/239557/delayed/quotes/nls/wfc WFC -0.33%  has been outstanding at increasing earnings per share on a consistent basis. In fact, it is somewhat eye opening at just how efficient the company seems to be, at least at increasing earnings per share every single quarter. This is coming from a skeptic, someone who does not trust the big banks to begin with, so my praise might even surprise some of my readers.However, there are reasons to be concerned, and one of them comes from a comparison of earnings and revenue. For Wells Fargo, earnings have been increasing steadily, as shown in the first chart, but in the second chart, we can see that revenue growth has been basically nonexistent. The company has not been growing revenue, it has only been increasing earnings based on revenues that already exist. This can be attributed to good management, but when the tides turn investors should be cautious.The question is are the tides turning at Wells Fargo? As of now, the earnings trend has not skipped a beat, and the company has managed to increase earnings on a quarterly basis since 2009, but analysts are expecting that to change this quarter. When the company reports on Friday, we will see if that is true or not, but if it is the growth rate for Wells Fargo will definitely come into question.In the third chart, we show the growth rate for Wells Fargo on a trailing 12-month basis, in a year-over-year format. That means we compare the trailing 12 months from this quarter to the trailing 12 months that existed in the same quarter of the previous year to determine what the growth rate has been, and plot that on a graph so that we can see that trend in growth over time.Although Wells Fargo has managed to increase earnings consistently, the growth rate has been declining, and if Wells Fargo actually makes less this quarter than it did last quarter, the growth rate in the chart will approach zero.Therefore, if Wells Fargo does what analysts expect it to do, the company may actually begin to make that turn, and that would raise all kinds of red flags.Technically, Wells Fargo has also come very close to a level of longer-term resistance as we have defined it in our real time trading report for WFC, and as a result, the upside appears limited to us on a technical basis. If Wells Fargo remains below longer-term resistance, we will expect it to fall all the way to longer-term support by rule. Using resistance as inflection, only if the stock is capable of breaking above resistance will that analysis change.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5D1AA1B4-C92E-4547-8397-50103D6903C1&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Ahead of the release of the Fed Minutes, it settled at $1,324.30 an ounce, up $7.80, or 0.6%, on Comex — gold’s first gain in four sessions.Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics:The FOMC agreed at its June meeting that QE will end with a final $15B taper in October, assuming the economy moves more or  less in line with their forecasts.Looking ahead, policymakers agreed they should communicate their post-QE plans to the markets “later this year, well before the first steps in normalizing policy”. This pre-supposes the incoming data will afford the Fed the luxury of time to ponder; we think the inflation and labor data will force their hand early next year.The minutes show no sign of concern at the run of three straight core inflation increases, but that view will change in the face of further gains. The FOMC is concerned investors aren’t “factoring in sufficient uncertainty about the path of the economy and monetary policy”; Amen to that, but the Fed isn’t worrying enough about inflation.Fed eases, market rallies.

While the current number of short positions only represents 2.24% of outstanding Home Depot shares , the sudden short interest increase dwarfs any other stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA .In the previous quarter, Home Depot reported quarterly results that fell below Wall Street expectations and raised its earnings outlook for the year.Plus, there’s these 10 things that home-improvement stores won’t tell you.Deutsche Bank’s chief U.S. economist Joseph LaVorgna expects a change in the dovish tone from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen some time “later in the year.”With job growth picking up and rising inflation, LaVorgna writes:While there is no question that Yellen is a dove, we wonder whether she will be able to explain away much lower unemployment and much higher inflation should the economy grow well above trend over the back half of this year.LaVorgna said that unemployment could be within 5.4% to 5.7% by the end of this year and that core inflation could growth faster than the conservative monthly Fed estimate and end this December at 2.0%. Stocks ticked up a bit higher following a weak 10-year Treasury auction Wednesday. At last check:DJIA: up 0.3% at 16,955SPX: up 0.3% at 1,970COMP: up 0.5% at 4,413 Micron .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/75433/delayed /quotes/nls/mu MU shares are lower Wednesday on worries of more intense competition from Samsung as the Korean chip maker moves to boost its DRAM output by 100,000 wafers per month.However, analyst Vijay Rakesh at Sterne Agee believes the concerns maybe exaggerated. “We see little reason for Samsung to bring on 100K wafer per month here,” he said.Rakesh added that the pullback in Micron’s shares is a good opportunity to buy into the stock and reiterated his buy rating.Despite a report by the Daily Mail that British American Tobacco may buy the 58% stake in Reynolds American  /quotes/zigman/334469/delayed /quotes/nls/rai RAI that it doesn’t already own, analyst Bonnie Herzog at Wells Fargo Securities believe a deal between Lorillard /quotes/zigman/511272/delayed /quotes/nls/lo LO and Reynolds is a more likely scenario.“While we think this [BAT-RAI] combination is possible and makes strategic sense, we continue to believe that ultimately an RAI/LO deal is more likely. We believe Susan Cameron’s return to the helm of RAI was driven by the board’s vision to have her lead the company into the next stage of growth, not simply to help facilitate a sale transaction to BAT within a few months.”Reports about a possible union between Lorillard and Reynolds have been circulating for a while with some suggesting a deal as early as end of this month.Shares of Reynolds are up 2.5% and Lorillard gained 0.6%.It’s safe to start buying airline stocks again, according to a Deutsche Bank analyst.With the stocks having gone from being overbought to the cusp of being oversold in less than a month, we see an emerging opportunity for long-term investors to initiate/add to positions in names that we think are the biggest beneficiaries of consolidation/restructuringThe favored ones are American Airlines .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/24849617/delayed /quotes/nls/aal AAL , United .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/617037/delayed /quotes/nls/ual UAL , Southwest .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/241463/delayed /quotes/nls/luv LUV , and Delta .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/463579/delayed /quotes/nls/dal DAL , according to analyst Michael Linenberg.The comments helped Delta and Southwest shares recover after two days of losses.Real Goods Solar .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/109405/delayed /quotes/nls/rgse RGSE  stock fell 3.5%, one of the few to see red as most solar and renewable-energy stocks rose after a two-day, broad-market skid.Expectations of thinner profit margins led analysts at Cowen and Co. to downgrade shares of Real Goods Solar Inc. on Wednesday.Stocks have notched up very modest gains after two days of selling. S&P 500 +0.23% Dow +0.18%Nasdaq +0.36%$SPX 200-day streak now at 409 trading days.

Gasoline stockpiles were forecast to be down 1 million barrels, while distillates, which include heating oil, were seen up 1.2 million barrels, according to the Platts poll.Among the petroleum products, August gasoline futures /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 -0.96%  fell 2.5 cents to $2.95 a gallon, while August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821453/delayed HOQ4 -0.35%  was down a half cent at $2.87 a gallon.Over in Libya, the nation’s largest oil field, Sharara, is resuming production and could reach two-thirds of its 340,000 barrel-a-day capacity by the end of Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported.“While it is clear that the grind lower in crude-oil prices are supported by the lack of fear premium in southern Iraq and/or increased near-term oil supply out of Libya, we believe the unwinding of net-long [speculative positions] continuing to come off the market are more responsible,” said John Macaluso, research analyst at Tyche Capital Advisors.“Over the last few weeks, the net-long specs were at near record highs and as the fear premium began to come off the market from easing in geopolitical fears, these net-long specs taking short positions to lock in profits triggered a negative reversal in crude-oil prices,” he said.Also on Nymex Wednesday, August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 +0.26%  was down a penny at $4.19 per million British thermal units after tallying losses of nearly 5% over the past two trading sessions.If the stock market flashed a ‘sell’ signal, it’s nowThanks for going Dutch, America10 companies that put nearly all the food on supermarket shelves	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A49CBC8A-0762-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

U.K.’s FTSE 100 yanked lower by insurers	By Sara Sjolin, MarketWatchThe Stoxx Europe 600 index /quotes/zigman/2380150/delayed XX:SXXP -0.0088%  ended slightly lower at 339.96, after posting the biggest loss in four months on Tuesday.The recent losses have come after global stock markets last week traded at or near record highs, creating fears of an asset bubble and spurring concerns that a correction is due. Specifically for Europe, a string of disappointing German data has also highlighted weaknesses in the euro zone’s powerhouse and led to concerns the country is heading toward zero economic growth. Read: Is Germany leading the euro zone toward the no-growth cliff?European benchmarks ended mixed on Wednesday, with both France’s CAC 40 index /quotes/zigman/3173214/delayed FR:PX1 +0.40% , up 0.4% at 4,359.84, and Germany’s DAX 30 index /quotes/zigman/2380246/delayed DX:DAX +0.36% , rising 0.4% to 9,808.20, rebounding after the prior day’s sharp losses.The U.K.’s FTSE 100 index /quotes/zigman/3173262/delayed UK:UKX -0.30% , however, dropped 0.3% to 6,718.04, as insurers took a dive. Admiral Group PLC /quotes/zigman/356643/delayed UK:ADM -3.30%  slid 3.3% after the insurer reported a drop in first-half turnover.Aviva PLC /quotes/zigman/153201/delayed UK:AV -3.63%  lost 3.6% as the company said it would focus on a smaller number of markets to improve its return on capital. Among other U.K. insurers, Legal & General Group PLC /quotes/zigman/160233/delayed UK:LGEN -0.75%  ended 0.8% lower and RSA Insurance Group PLC /quotes/zigman/33545560/delayed UK:RSA -0.95%  lost 1%.Also in London, shares of BP PLC /quotes/zigman/210014/delayed UK:BP -0.53%   /quotes/zigman/247026/delayed/quotes/nls/bp BP -0.32%  erased 0.5% after Deutsche Bank cut the oil major to hold from buy, according to Dow Jones Newswires.Outside the main index in London, J D Wetherspoon PLC /quotes/zigman/202242/delayed UK:JDW -1.97%  shed 2% after the British pub chain said sales slowed during the World Cup in soccer.A dearth of economic data for Europe on Wednesday meant that investors instead focused on key central-bank events. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is due to speak in London in the evening, while Executive Board members Benoît Cœuré and Peter Praet spoke in Athens and Paris, respectively. Praet said the ECB’s targeted long-term refinancing operation will break a vicious spiral of high lending rates for companies, high credit risk and poor economic performance.The main event will be the release of minutes from the Fed’s June meeting due at 7 p.m. London time, or 2 p.m. Eastern. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is clearly among the doves on the policy-setting committee, and investors are hoping that the minutes will “provide some clarity and reassurance that Yellen can continue to hold sway over her more hawkish colleagues,” Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said in a note. Read: Minutes may shed some light on how and when the Fed will hikeAfter a solid June jobs report out last week, several banks have moved forward their forecast as to when the Fed will introduce the first rate hike.U.S. stocks traded higher ahead of the minutes.Back in Europe, airlines rebounded after a sharp selloff on Tuesday sparked by a profit warning from Air France-KLM /quotes/zigman/127901/delayed FR:AF +1.98% . On Wednesday, Air France-KLM climbed 2% and EasyJet PLC /quotes/zigman/9024337/delayed UK:EZJ +3.13%  picked up 3.1%. Deutsche Lufthansa AG /quotes/zigman/184134/delayed DE:LHA +1.04%  gained 1.4% after it said it would cut capacity growth and seek lower costs on long-haul flights.Gemalto NV /quotes/zigman/14944412/delayed NL:GTO +3.02%  added 3% in Amsterdam after Morgan Stanley lifted the digital-security company to equal-weight from underweight.Shares of Portugal’s Banco Espirito Santo SA /quotes/zigman/176527/delayed PT:BES -4.65%  slumped 4.7% after reports that parent company Espirito Santo International delayed coupon payments on its short-term debt.

Brazil is going to be just fine	By Matthew FuttermanThe sun came up. People went to work. They drove taxis, opened grocery stores, clicked on their computers to handle legal and financial matters. Doctors healed the sick. Social workers tackled the problems of the vast poverty in this country of some 200 million. Life went on.Guess what didn’t happen? Cities didn’t burn. Mass riots didn’t erupt. As far as we can tell, no soccer fans threw themselves off buildings because their beloved Seleção was embarrassed by Germany, 7-1, in Tuesday’s World Cup semifinal. (Why Brazilian stocks are rallying after that awful World Cup loss)In the cruel light of day, it still feels strange to write “Germany 7, Brazil 1.” That kind of result doesn’t happen at this level of soccer. Brazil last lost a competitive game on home soil in 1975. If I were a native, I’d be shaken, at a loss to describe the debacle that went down in the mining city of Belo Horizonte. (5 lopsided wins to compare with Germany’s 7-1 defeat of Brazil in World Cup semifinal)Make no mistake: The defeat to Germany, to borrow U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann’s favorite phrase, was “a real bummer.” The people here love their footy as much as any country anywhere loves any sport. The government declares national holidays when the national team plays. Streets empty, and I mean empty -- like you can pitch a tent in the middle of a main thoroughfare and not get hit.Still, don’t buy the narrative that this loss is going to leave some indelible national scar on a country so desperately trying to thrive in a lot of areas that have nothing to do with soccer. That idea is rather demeaning to the Brazilians I’ve met, who just might be the warmest collection of souls I’ve come across.There was the woman at the eyeglass store here in São Paulo who refused to accept money for the eyeglass case she gave me after I had lost mine. There were the college students in Natal who offered me a tour of the city and a ride back to my hotel in the middle of the night when there was no media shuttle in sight following the U.S. win over Ghana. There was the rabbi who, 30 seconds after meeting me, insisted I go to a Sabbath dinner at one of his congregants’ homes. (I did, and the matzo ball soup was awesome). There are countless souls who have stood patiently with me on the street, waiting as I fumbled through my pocket Portuguese dictionary, searching for the right word to complete a dumb question, when surely they had something better to do.I’ve been here a month. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in Brazilian culture. My sample size is small and somewhat limited to hotels, restaurants, soccer stadiums and running paths next to beaches in Rio, Natal, Recife and a few other host cities. I know about the crime and the intense poverty.But I also know this is an amazing, diverse country. Fly four hours into the Amazon from São Paulo, and the people look completely different from those in the country’s commercial center. In Salvador on the northeast coast you might as well be in West Africa. In every city, people of every shade of black, brown and white skin populate areas that are rich and poor. It’s a country of stunning physical beauty and vast natural resources. Rush-hour traffic makes Los Angeles arteries look like country drives, a sure sign that the place needs some infrastructure upgrades but also that there are a lot hardworking folks who want to make tomorrow better than today.In other words, Brazil is a lot more than a canary jersey and an obsession with soccer.The collapse against Germany will surely spark some national soul-searching about how Brazil cultivates and develops its next generation of soccer stars. The country has a huge talent pool to draw from, but accidents don’t happen in sports anymore. Winning at the highest level today takes not just talent but money, training and a cohesive strategy.“When you think about it,” a 20-something Brazilian in one of those ubiquitous yellow jerseys said to me in a bar last night, “it’s kind of funny. I mean, seven goals. It’s funny, right?”I’m going to bet that Brazil as a whole is going to be just fine after this. Bummed out for a bit, sure, but ultimately fine. In a lot of ways, it already is.Read more on WSJ.com.More From MarketWatch:Smartphone dependency fuels other addictions, say rehab clinicsIf ever the stock market flashed a ‘sell’ signal, it’s now10 companies that put nearly all the food on supermarket shelves	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CFCDCC84-077E-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Foreign home buyers flock to U.S.	By Amy Hoak, MarketWatchTotal sales to foreign buyers reached an estimated $92.2 billion from April 2013 through March 2014, up from $68.2 billion the previous year, according to NAR’s 2014 Profile of International Home Buying Activity report. That’s about 7% of the total U.S. existing home sales for the period.Four states — Florida, California, Arizona and Texas — accounted for more than half of the total reported purchases to international buyers, the report found. Twenty-three percent of foreign purchases were in Florida. The top five cities searched by international buyers: Los Angeles, Miami, Las Vegas, Orlando and New York, according to data from Realtor.com.Buyers from Canada made the largest share of purchases (19%), while buyers from China led in dollar volume, buying up $22 billion in property (with an average price of $590,826). Other common places where international buyers hailed from included Mexico, India and the United Kingdom.The study is based on a survey of 3,547 NAR members. Those who participated submitted sales prices and quantities sold, which helped researchers make their estimations, said Jed Smith, managing director of quantitative research for the group and one of the study’s co-authors. Both resident and non-resident foreigners are counted as international buyers.“They see the U.S. as a place of economic stability, they see value in our market and view it as a positive place to invest their dollars,” said Danny Hertzberg, sales associate with The Jills Coldwell Banker, based in Miami. About 70% of his buyers are international, coming primarily from Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina, he said. “In many places, it’s a hedge against their currency.”While international buyers have been increasing over the past few years, Hertzberg has noticed a significant surge in his market during the last 12 months — reflective of the national report.“Some people are buying trophy properties, some are modest second homes and some people are buying for investment purchases,” said Smith, from NAR. The median price for a home purchase to an international buyer: $268,284, according to the report.Other buyers have children attending school in the U.S. and seek a place for them to stay, said Wei Min Tan, a real-estate agent with Rutenberg Realty in New York City. While shocking headlines of multimillion-dollar property sales to foreign investors often make a splash in the media, Tan said there are many foreign buyers looking for more modestly priced homes.And some are looking for downright bargains.More of RealtyTrac’s subscribers are coming from foreign countries, according to the company. RealtyTrac provides listings for all types of properties, including non-distressed homes as well as short sales, auctions and foreclosures. Foreign subscriber activity increased 125% between 2009 and 2013, with the biggest increases coming from the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland and China, said spokeswoman Jennifer von Pohlmann. Foreign subscribers to RealtyTrac are most prevalent in Canada, followed by the United Kingdom, Australia, China and Mexico.Still, the influx of foreign buyers has at least one significant effect on domestic buyers.“A lot of the foreign buyers [make sales in] all cash,” Tan said. “They are driving up the prices that way. They are getting the edge in terms of the negotiation.”Indeed, nearly 60% of reported international transactions within the past year were all cash, compared with one-third of domestic purchases, according to the NAR report.Often, locals will offer the same amount as a foreign buyer — or more, Hertzberg said. But most domestic buyers need a mortgage in order to buy the home, while many foreign buyers don’t. An all-cash offer is often preferable to the seller because they are more certain to close.Also on MarketWatch:To win a house bidding war, get creativeBuy your own town for just $399,000 — in South Dakota5 states with the most (and fewest) foreclosures	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=78B8E914-06C1-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Treasurys extend drop after weak 10-year note sale	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe shorter-term yield, which is sensitive to shifts in expectations about Federal Reserve monetary policy, has been on the rise as investors recalibrate forecasts toward earlier hikes to the central bank’s key lending rates.The Fed is set to release minutes of its last policy meeting at 2 p.m. Eastern, which may shed light on whether the central bank is thinking about when and how it will lift rates. The Fed is committed to a near-zero policy rate until the labor market improves further and inflation stabilizes.The 3-year yield /quotes/zigman/4868286/delayed 3_YEAR +8.41% , which rises as prices fall was up 2.5 basis points on the day at 1.023%; the last time it closed above 1% was in April 2011.Nonetheless, investors still view rate-hike timing as more subdued than the consensus outlook published by the Fed. Futures contracts tied to the fed funds rate project the first rate hike occurring in June 2015, according to CME FedWatch.“The gap between the market view of rates and the Fed’s summary of economic projections is smaller than it was a few weeks ago but it’s still wide, suggesting the market is discounting [the Fed] significantly,” said Jake Lowery, portfolio manager with Voya Investment Management.Treasurys extended a fall after a weak auction of $21 billion in 10-year Treasury notes /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +1.41% , where non-dealers bought a smaller portion of the debt than during recent sales. After the auction, benchmark note yield was up 2.5 basis points at 2.590%.The 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR +2.12%  yield was up 3 basis points at 1.727% while the 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR +0.53%  yield rose a basis point to 3.393%. The differential between them narrowed to the least since 2009 in what’s known as a flattening yield curve.More must-reads from MarketWatch:One chart shows the diverging fortunes of U.S. and Europe22 stocks that may be the gems of earnings seasonIf ever the stock market flashed a ‘sell’ signal, it’s now	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9DDB902A-0766-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Fed plans to end bond purchases in October	By Greg Robb, MarketWatchAccording to the new plan, the Fed will make a $15 billion final reduction at its October meeting, after trimming it by $10 billion at each meeting up to that point.Fed officials said that members of the public had asked them if the Fed would end the program in October or with a final $5 billion reduction in December.Read selected highlights from Fed minutesMost Fed officials said that the exact end of the tapering issue with no bearing on the timing of the first rate hike. The Fed has said that rates would remain near zero for a “considerable time” after the Fed halts its program of bond purchases.Stocks /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.45%   dipped immediately have the Fed minutes were released but quickly moved higher. Bond yields /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +0.12%  also had a brief move higher after the report.The minutes also reveal that Fed officials had a lengthy discussion of its exit strategy.The central bankers generally agreed to keep reinvesting the proceeds of securities that mature on its balance sheet until after it had hiked interest rates.Fed officials also agreed that the rate of interest on excess reserves would plan a “central role” in moving rates higher when the time comes. It will have an overnight reverse-repo facility with an interest rate set below the IOER rate. The spread would be “near of above the current level of 20 basis points and give the Fed adequate control over interest rates.A reverse repo is when the Fed accepts cash from counterparties such as banks and money-market funds on an overnight basis in return for a security.Responding to some criticism that the Fed’s overnight repo facility might become so large and drown out private market participants, the central bankers discussed some design features that might limit the size.Several Fed officials said that they don’t think the facility would become a permanent policy tool.Fed officials said they would release a more detailed exit plan later this year. The Fed’s last exit plan was released in the summer of 2011.At their meeting, the Fed unanimously decided to trim monthly bond purchases to $35 billion from $45 billion. Fed officials released their forecasts that signaled that the first hike in interest rates would come in 2015.According to the minutes, the Fed staff was not concerned with inflation despite some recent higher readings.Although the Fed staff revised its inflation forecast up “a little” in the near term, the medium term projection was revised down slightly.Many economists are worried that the central bank might be falling behind the curve.At the press conference after the June meeting, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said that recent inflation readings were “noisy.”Fed officials were split on the inflation outlook. Some were concerned about below-trend inflation persisting while others expected a faster pickup.Read more news on MarketWatchThanks for going Dutch, AmericaCupcakes are everything that’s wrong with America	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B6B73300-0767-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Detroit art valued at up to $4.6 billion	By Matthew DolanSome creditors pushing the city to sell or lease its world-class art collection argue that the city previously lowballed the artwork by valuing only a slice of the collection at the Detroit Institute of Arts.With the comprehensive estimate by Artvest Partners many times the earlier estimate of up to $867 million, the battle over Detroit art could play a big role in a trial on the city’s debt-cutting plan to be held next month.On Wednesday, Detroit’s emergency manager who represents the city in its municipal bankruptcy case said the report wouldn’t change his support to keep the city-owned collection intact and transfer ownership to a nonprofit separate from the city. His office also noted that selling off the entire collection immediately would only yield a fraction of the overall valuation, according to the report.“The report makes it abundantly clear that selling art to settle debt will not generate the kind of revenue the City’s creditors claim it will,” Bill Nowling, spokesman for Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr, said in a statement Wednesday.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:“Rotten rotation” could signal bull market living on borrowed timeLook out Argentina, U.S. fans have gone DutchSmartphone dependency fuels other addictions	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3BF43A18-0790-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Selected highlights from the Fed minutes	On ending the bond-buying program: “Some committee members had been asked by members of the public whether, if tapering in the pace of purchases continues as expected, the final reduction would come in a single $15 billion per month reduction or in a $10 billion reduction followed by a $5 billion reduction. Most participants viewed this as a technical issue with no substantive macroeconomic consequences and no consequences for the eventual decision about the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate—a decision that will depend on the Committee’s evolving assessments of actual and expected progress toward its objectives. In light of these considerations, participants generally agreed that if incoming information continued to support its expectation of improvement in labor market conditions and a return of inflation toward its longer-run objective, it would be appropriate to complete asset purchases with a $15 billion reduction in the pace of purchases in order to avoid having the small, remaining level of purchases receive undue focus among investors. If the economy progresses about as the Committee expects, warranting reductions in the pace of purchases at each upcoming meeting, this final reduction would occur following the October meeting.”Read more on Fed plans to end bond purchases in OctoberOn when to lift interest rates: “For example, a number of participants noted their concern that a more gradual approach might be appropriate if forecasts of above-trend economic growth later this year were not realized. And a couple suggested that the Committee might need to strengthen its commitment to maintain sufficient policy accommodation to return inflation to its target over the medium term in order to prevent an undesirable decline in inflation expectations. Alternatively, some other participants expressed concern that economic growth over the medium run might be faster than currently expected or that the rate of growth of potential output might be lower than currently expected, calling for a more rapid move to begin raising the federal funds rate in order to avoid significantly overshooting the Committee’s unemployment and inflation objectives.”On when to stop rolling over Treasurys and reinvesting principal on mortgage securities: “Many participants agreed that ending reinvestments at or after the time of liftoff would be best, with most of these participants preferring to end them after liftoff. These participants thought that an earlier change to the reinvestment policy would involve risks to the economic outlook if it was seen as suggesting that the Committee was likely to tighten policy more rapidly than currently anticipated or if it had unexpectedly large effects in MBS markets; moreover, an early change could add complexity to the Committee’s communications at a time when it would be clearer to signal changes in policy through interest rates alone. However, some participants favored ending reinvestments prior to the first firming in policy interest rates, as stated in the Committee’s exit strategy principles announced in June 2011. Those participants thought that such an approach would avoid weakening the credibility of the Committee’s communications regarding normalization, would act to modestly reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, or would help prepare the public for the eventual rise in short-term interest rates.”On which rates to use when normalizing policy: “Most participants agreed that adjustments in the rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER) should play a central role during the normalization process. It was generally agreed that an [overnight reverse repurchase agreement] facility with an interest rate set below the IOER rate could play a useful supporting role by helping to firm the floor under money market interest rates.”On the spread between the rate paid on excess reserves and on overnight repos: “The appropriate size of the spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates was discussed, with many participants judging that a relatively wide spread—perhaps near or above the current level of 20 basis points—would support trading in the federal funds market and provide adequate control over market interest rates. Several participants noted that the spread might be adjusted during the normalization process.”On when to announce how policy will be normalized: “It was observed that it would be useful for the Committee to develop and communicate its plans to the public later this year, well before the first steps in normalizing policy become appropriate. Most participants indicated that they expected to learn more about the effects of the Committee’s various policy tools as normalization proceeds, and many favored maintaining flexibility about the evolution of the normalization process as well as the Committee’s longer-run operating framework.”Also read: The Janet Yellen dashboard — how the Fed chief views the jobs marketFed may have to hike sooner than expected, former White House economist saysWells Fargo earnings could be a warning	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=AC210ADA-078D-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

This pre-supposes the incoming data will afford the Fed the luxury of time to ponder; we think the inflation and labor data will force their hand early next year.The minutes show no sign of concern at the run of three straight core inflation increases, but that view will change in the face of further gains.

We’re flying blind investing for retirement	Hearts & Wallets, a financial services market research firm, just held focus groups with 72 men and women age 40 to 64 with at least $250,000 in investible assets and found that very few of them knew which investment products were in their retirement portfolio or why.Chris Brown, a Hearts & Wallets principal, told me he heard comments like: “I can’t remember the name; my broker told me to buy it.”The danger of flying blind for retirementProblem is, Brown noted, “if you don’t know what your investments are, you don’t know your exposure to the stock market or interest rates.” Then, if you’ve unwittingly put all your chips on stocks and retire as the market collapses, you could be in serious financial trouble.Brown’s study echoes one from benefits consultant Towers Watson in 2012 where only one in five large companies said they believed their employees generally made informed decisions about retirement savings.Ignoring a key retirement decisionThe Hearts & Wallets study also discovered that very few focus group investors had given serious thought to how they’ll go from accumulating assets for retirement to turning that portfolio into income when they’re in retirement.Most have “no idea,” the Hearts & Wallets report “Life After Work and Fear of the Unknown” noted. “You’d think they’d plan more for it,” said Brown.I asked Brown why people nearing retirement don’t focus on what financial advisers call the “decumulation” phase. “A lot of it is inertia,” he said. “Planning your retirement income means making some tough decisions. So it’s like going to the dentist; they put it off until they have to.”Another reason: Many people don’t know when they’ll retire.Why target date funds are a turnoffBrown said the retirement date mystery also explains why so many in the focus groups won’t invest in target date funds (which handle asset allocation decisions for them pegged to their intended retirement date) through their 401(k) and other employer-sponsored retirement plans.They’re skittish of committing to, say, a Target Date 2025 Fund which would likely tilt heavily toward bonds and cash when 2025 rolls around. Said Brown: “They say: ‘I don’t know how long I’ll live after the target fund’s date. I could live to 105. So I don’t want my money to go to cash at the target fund’s date.’”	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=1DAA4E7C-FE0C-11E3-A77D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Dish urges FCC to reject Comcast purchase of Time Warner	By Shalini RamachandranDish Chairman Charlie Ergen met with FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler on Monday and made his case against the $42 billion deal, which would unite the nation’s two largest cable companies. Among other things, he said, the merger “should be denied” because it would give the combined cable companies too much clout in the broadband marketplace. Ergen and senior Dish /quotes/zigman/109220/delayed/quotes/nls/dish DISH +1.23%   executives also met with Roger Sherman, chief of the wireless telecommunications bureau, according to the filing.The agency could choose to approve the deal with conditions, but Dish says no potential regulatory conditions could “remedy the harms” of the merger.In particular, the satellite operator voiced concerns about Comcast’s /quotes/zigman/89307/delayed/quotes/nls/cmcsa CMCSA +2.66%   control over “at least three ‘choke points’ “ in the Internet that could “harm competing video services.” Those include the “last mile” of pipe connecting to consumers’ homes, the “interconnection point” between Comcast’s network and other Internet companies’ networks, and so-called “managed” channels that cable operators use for video-on-demand services, which can “act as high speed lanes and squeeze the capacity of the public Internet portion of the pipe.” Dish is among several companies planning subscription online-video services.A Comcast spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Container Store: It’s the consumer’s fault, not our’sFed plans to finish its taper in OctoberIf ever the stock market flashed a ‘sell’ signal, it’s now	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=46C48C82-079E-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Oil under $103, suffers 9th straight session loss	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchCrude for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -1.18%  fell $1.11, or 1.1%, to settle at $102.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices, tracking the most-active contracts, closed at their lowest level since roughly mid-May. They have now tallied a nine-session loss of more than $4 a barrel.August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -0.60%  shed 66 cents, or 0.6%, to $108.28 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.Early Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles fell 2.4 million barrels for the week ended July 4. Analysts polled by Platts forecast a decline of 3 million barrels, while American Petroleum Institute data late Tuesday reportedly showed a decline of 1.7 million barrels.“We have more sell orders piling up as there is oversupply at Cushing and refineries are running nearly 92% of their capacity,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade. Cushing, Okla. is the trading hub for Nymex oil futures and stockpiles there saw a weekly rise of roughly 400,000 barrels.Gasoline supplies unexpectedly rose by 600,000 barrels, while distillate stockpiles climbed by 200,000 barrels, according to the EIA. Gasoline stockpiles were forecast to be down 1 million barrels, while distillates, which include heating oil, were seen up 1.2 million barrels, according to the Platts poll.Among the petroleum products, August gasoline futures /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 -1.09%  fell 3.5 cents to $2.94 a gallon, while August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821453/delayed HOQ4 -0.35%  closed down less than a half cent at $2.87 a gallon.Over in Libya, the nation’s largest oil field, Sharara, is resuming production and could reach two-thirds of its 340,000 barrel-a-day capacity by the end of Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported.“While it is clear that the grind lower in crude-oil prices are supported by the lack of a fear premium in southern Iraq and/or increased near-term oil supply out of Libya, we believe the unwinding of net-long [speculative positions] continuing to come off the market are more responsible,” said John Macaluso, research analyst at Tyche Capital Advisors.“Over the last few weeks, the net-long specs were at near record highs and as the fear premium began to come off the market from easing in geopolitical fears, these net-long specs taking short positions to lock in profits triggered a negative reversal in crude-oil prices,” he said.Also on Nymex Wednesday, August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 -0.21%  fell 3 cents, or 0.8%, to end at $4.17 per million British thermal units after tallying losses of nearly 5% over the past two trading sessions.If the stock market flashed a ‘sell’ signal, it’s nowThanks for going Dutch, America10 companies that put nearly all the food on supermarket shelves	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A49CBC8A-0762-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

American teens can’t read a pay slip	By Angela JohnsonMore than one in six 15-year-olds is unable to make even simple decisions about everyday spending, and only one in 10 can solve complex financial tasks, according to the test.Among the seemingly simple questions that American teens struggled with was determining how much money was going into a bank account from a theoretical month’s pay.The pay slip for the month of July listed four numbers: Gross pay, deductions, net salary and gross salary year to date.Only 28.8% could correctly say how much money was automatically deposited into the worker’s bank account. By comparison, 74.8% of students in Shanghai got the right answer. Americans also performed below the OECD average.Overall, only 9.4% of American 15-year-olds were among the best performers in the financial-literacy test, as opposed to 43% of the Shanghai students.The lackluster U.S. showing has been consistent with previous reading and math studies conducted by the Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA. Math and reading skills are closely related to financial literacy.On the bright side, American teens did do better than those in Colombia, Italy and France, among others.How well would you score?

ECB’s Draghi calls for rules on economic reforms	By Paul HannonIn outlining a new proposal from the ECB that would further deepen the economic integration of the euro zone, Mr. Draghi said differences in the competitiveness of its 18 member economies are as much a threat to its survival as differences in their debt loads.The ECB has long called for greater structural reform of euro-zone economies to narrow the differences between their economic performance, but in a speech in London, Mr. Draghi gave the clearest outline yet of a governance structure that would help bring that about.While the euro zone’s crisis was triggered by the inability of some of its member governments to borrow on international bond markets because their debts had grown too large, many economists and policy makers believe that reflected more deep-rooted economic differences. Specifically, they said businesses and workers in those countries most affected by the crisis had lost their ability to compete with their counterparts elsewhere in the currency area, leading to large current-account deficits that were financed through foreign borrowing.Mr. Draghi noted that while the World Economic Forum ranks euro-zone member Finland third in the world in terms of competitiveness, Greece ranks No. 91. Similarly, he noted that the World Bank ranked Ireland 15th in the world for ease of doing business, while it ranks Malta at No. 103.“No firm or individual should be penalized by its country of residence,” he said. “The persistence of such differences creates the risk of permanent imbalances. With this in mind, I believe that structural reforms in each country are enough of a common interest to justify that they are made subject to discipline at the community level.”Mr. Draghi said establishing new rules that would require member governments to take “corrective action” to improve the competitiveness of their economies would strengthen the cohesion of the currency area and help boost growth and create jobs.He said the existence of euro-zone rules would also help governments implement needed reforms, which would “require substantial political capital.”“Historical experience, for example of the IMF (International Monetary Fund), makes a convincing case that the discipline imposed by supranational bodies can make it easier to frame the debate on reforms at the national level,” he said. “In particular, the debate can be framed not in terms of whether, but in terms of how reform needs to take place.”Speaking earlier Wednesday, ECB Executive Board member Benoît Curé made a similar case for “a convergence of economic policies and structures” that would be “embedded in a binding European effort, based on benchmarks to be met by all euro-area member states.”The ECB’s proposals for greater integration in economic policy-making comes at a time when some leading members of the currency area are arguing for greater flexibility in applying the existing fiscal rules so that they reflect the particular circumstances of individual countries, and give them more freedom to pursue economic reforms.Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has been leading efforts to shift the main focus of the euro zone’s response to the crisis to growth from stability and fiscal rigor. His government has called for more flexibility in the application of fiscal rules and policies aimed at boosting investment.Mr. Renzi was alone among euro-zone political leaders in picking up significant support during May elections for the European Parliament. Across the EU, support rose for parties that are avowedly skeptical of the benefits of further integration and argue for the transfer back to national parliaments of powers now exercised by the EU.In his speech, Mr. Draghi also said the rules that govern government borrowing in the euro zone must be strictly observed.“To unwind the consolidation that has been achieved, and in doing so to divest the rules of credibility, would be self-defeating for all countries,” Mr. Draghi said.Mr. Draghi also repeated his concern about too-low inflation in the euro zone, and the ECB’s readiness to use “unconventional instruments within its mandate” should that problem persist.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com .‘Rotten rotation’ could signal bull market on borrowed timeFed plans to end bond purchases in October	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=449C273A-0799-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Puerto Rico power authority rating cut 4 rungs: S&P	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority had the rating on its $8.6 billion in debt cut four notches to B- by Standard & Poors Ratings Services on Wednesday. The downgrade from BB, which pushes it further into junk territory, came in the wake of a temporary extension of its revolving credit facility, which must now be repaid by the end of July. The inability to negotiate a renewal with creditors drove the downgrade of its long-term debt. The analysts said: We believe this increases the risk that the authority will attempt to restructure long-term debt, as a law passed in June allows. Puerto Rico has made holders of its $73 billion in municipal bonds nervous recently as it struggles to fix its economic and fiscal situation; public authority debt is thought to be most at risk.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5549B968-51EF-482A-925F-35E1B5848728&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Post-Obamacare, uninsured higher in ‘red’ states	By Quentin Fottrell, MarketWatchSome 57% of people with Health Insurance Exchange coverage were uninsured prior to purchasing their current plan, according to a recent survey by the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation. Most of this previously uninsured group went without coverage for two years or more, the report found, and 70% who were uninsured before Obamacare say they decided to buy insurance because of the law. (Estimates vary, however. Management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimated that only 36% of those with Obamacare were previously uninsured, while the Rand Corp. think-tank put it at 28%.)Combining these estimates with new data on Medicaid recipients and private plan enrollees under Obamacare, financial website WalletHub estimated the uninsured rates post-Obamacare for 43 states and the District of Columbia. (Other states were excluded due to data limitations.) “Blue” Democratic states have fewer uninsured residents (with an average ranking of 15.9 on the list) than red Republican states (28.5): Massachusetts, Rhode Island, D.C., Hawaii and Oregon had the lowest uninsured rates post-Obamacare; New Mexico, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas had the highest.People are signing up for health insurance, particularly in states that are expanding Medicaid and where the health exchange is working well, says Doug Whiteman, insurance analyst with Bankrate.com, a personal-finance research and publishing company. “Most states are reliant on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange, which has had its challenges,” he says. “But a few states, including Massachusetts, Kentucky and New York, have launched successful state-operated exchanges.” Some 12% of Americans have no health insurance, versus 15% last fall, according to a recent Bankrate survey.While government data have provided some basic demographic information about Health Insurance Exchange plan enrollees, some experts say detail has been fuzzy about the health status of either of these groups or whether they had insurance before enrolling. But Kaiser found the age and gender distribution is similar for those in Obamacare-compliant plans purchased inside and outside the marketplace: 34% of adults with compliant plans are under age 35 and 47% are male, according to the study, which was conducted from early April to early May 2014, after the first Obamacare open enrollment closed.However, there’s a solid block of states in the south where the rates of uninsured are remaining high because those states have rejected Medicaid expansion, Whiteman says. The Affordable Care Act intended to extend coverage to many poor Americans through an expansion of Medicaid, but a 2012 Supreme Court ruling made the expansion of Medicaid optional for states. “Many Republican-controlled states, particularly across the south, have refused to go along,” he adds. The Kaiser report has estimated that approximately 7.5 million low-income uninsured adults won’t get coverage because their states rejected the Medicaid expansion.Other articles by Quentin Fottrell:Smartphone dependency fuels other addictionsIs Obamacare really a wealth-care law?Obamacare fix brings new complicationsShould you negotiate your copays?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7FF2FDA6-0797-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Dollar falls after FOMC minutes	By Sara Sjolin, MarketWatchCurrency, equity and treasury investors interpreted the Fed minutes as a continuation of the central bank’s accommodative policy stance, which effectively means the bank will sit on its hands for a couple of months until QE ends, said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX Strategy for BK Asset Management. This stance will likely keep the dollar weak at least until the bank’s September meeting.The ICE dollar index /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY -0.18% , which measures the greenback against a basket of six rivals, fell to 80.032, compared with 80.176 late Tuesday.Against the Japanese yen /quotes/zigman/4868099/realtime/sampled USDJPY -0.0001% , the dollar rose to ¥101.61 from ¥101.57 on Tuesday.“Dollar bulls will be crossing their fingers in the hope of a more hawkish tone to the minutes,” Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FxPro, said in a note.The euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/realtime/sampled EURUSD +0.0036%  rose slightly to $1.364 from Tuesday’s level of $1.361.The pound /quotes/zigman/4867886/realtime/sampled GBPUSD -0.0047%  rose to $1.715, from $1.713 Tuesday, while the Australian dollar /quotes/zigman/4867876/realtime/sampled AUDUSD +0.0043%  was trading at 94.13 U.S. cents, up from 93.99 U.S. cents.7 market myths that make investors poorerDow 17,000 is on the wrong side of history6 companies that should report huge earnings gains	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0A74DAAE-0747-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09
Airlines bounce back, as American, Delta rally	By Tomi KilgoreThe NYSE Arca Airline index /quotes/zigman/6015477/realtime XX:XAL +1.21%   rallied 1.2%, with 13 of its 16 components gaining ground. The index closed back above its 50-day simple moving average, which technicians use to track the short-term trend, after closing below it on Tuesday for the first time since April 28. The index is still down 4.5% since closing at a 12-year high on June 6.Among the index’s most-active components, American Airlines shares /quotes/zigman/24849617/delayed/quotes/nls/aal AAL +4.28%   ran up 4.3%, after falling as much as 10% over the last couple of weeks. The world’s largest airline by traffic eased investor worries by raising its second-quarter margin estimate, and provided an upbeat outlook for second-quarter passenger revenue growth. Investors shrugged off the company’s announcement that it would book about $600 million in charges related to fuel hedges and bankruptcy reorganization costs.Delta’s stock /quotes/zigman/463579/delayed/quotes/nls/dal DAL +1.43%  climbed 1.4%, after closing Tuesday at a 2 1/2-month low. The company’s disappointing monthly passenger revenue metrics reported on July 2 have been blamed for the recent weakness in the stock, as well as the sector.Investors also cheered news that Deutsche Lufthansa AG /quotes/zigman/184115/delayed XE:LHA +1.36%   was cutting capacity growth, as that helped assuage worries that excess capacity was weighing on international demand.Elsewhere in the sector, shares of Southwest Airlines /quotes/zigman/241463/delayed/quotes/nls/luv LUV +1.91%   advanced 1.9% after reporting monthly passenger traffic data, JetBlue Airways /quotes/zigman/87304/delayed/quotes/nls/jblu JBLU +1.62%   rallied 1.6%, United Continental Holdings /quotes/zigman/617037/delayed/quotes/nls/ual UAL +1.34%   added 1.3% and SkyWest /quotes/zigman/77976/delayed/quotes/nls/skyw SKYW +0.64%   gained 0.6%.Although airline investors generally remain bullish on the sector, they have started questioning whether they’ve been missing anything given the recent selloff, said analyst Hunter Keay at Wolfe Research. His recommendation: don’t worry.He said Monday marked the sixth time that U.S. network airlines underperformed the S&P 500 by more than 7% on a rolling daily basis. “The good news: the stocks then proceeded to outperform the S&P 500 by 16% on average over the following 30 trading days,” Keay wrote in a note to clients.More must reads from MarketWatch :Fed plans to end bond purchases in October‘Rotten rotation’ could signal bull market living on borrowed timeContainer Store: It’s the consumer’s fault, not ours	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=671C7344-079B-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

Despite the improving economic data, consensus expectations for the timing of the Fed’s first federal funds rate hike remain anchored at mid-2015, according to forecasts embedded in futures market.”So a Fed rate hike isn’t likely to spark a slide, according to the Mizuho strategist:“Considering the uncertainty surrounding such predictions and past market anticipatory patterns, a prospective shift is unlikely to become a stock market catalyst unless the rate increase trajectory moves forward by six months or more.”More than 30 minutes into today’s session, the 3 main indexes are still up but have pulled back from their session highs.But the small-cap Russell 2000 has turned negative in the last few minutes.

Fed tapers, market rallies. It’s almost like we’re in a bull market.— Irrelevant Investor (@michaelbatnick) July 9, 2014 Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics:The FOMC agreed at its June meeting that QE will end with a final $15B taper in October, assuming the economy moves more or  less in line with their forecasts.Looking ahead, policymakers agreed they should communicate their post-QE plans to the markets “later this year, well before the first steps in normalizing policy”. This pre-supposes the incoming data will afford the Fed the luxury of time to ponder; we think the inflation and labor data will force their hand early next year.The minutes show no sign of concern at the run of three straight core inflation increases, but that view will change in the face of further gains. The FOMC is concerned investors aren’t “factoring in sufficient uncertainty about the path of the economy and monetary policy”; Amen to that, but the Fed isn’t worrying enough about inflation.Gold futures continued to gain ground in electronic trading, after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s June meeting showed that the central bank has decided to end its asset purchase program in October if the economy stays on track.August gold .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 was at $1,325.60 an ounce in electronic trading.

Wells Fargo earnings: Here’s what investors can expect	By Sital S. Patel, MarketWatchEarnings: The nation’s largest mortgage provider is expected to report second-quarter earnings of $1.01 a share, compared with 98 cents a share in the year-ago period, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. The bank has had 17-straight quarters of rising profits, despite sluggish results from its peers.Revenue: The bank is expected to report a decline in revenue. The consensus estimate is for $20.83 billion for the quarter, compared to $21.38 billion a year ago.Stock reaction: Shares are trading at $52, up 14.7% year-to-date and slightly below their 52-week high of $53.08 a share, hit in the last week. Wells Fargo shares have outperformed the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund /quotes/zigman/246222/delayed/quotes/nls/xlf XLF +0.26% , which tracks financial stocks in the S&P 500. The fund is up 4.23% year-to-date. Billionaire Warren Buffett is the bank’s largest shareholder.Key issues: Analysts will look to see how much Wells Fargo was able to curb a slowdown in mortgage refinancing due to rising rates, and increase exposure to commercial real estate and consumer credit to boost revenue. A strong equity underwriting environment in the second-quarter is also expected to benefit the bank’s investment banking revenue. Analysts will be looking for growth in deposits at the bank.Litigation issues: Settlements related to the financial crisis could be on the horizon for the San Francisco-based bank. Wells Fargo is expected to settle at some point with the Justice Department over mortgage securities sold before the financial crisis. In May, the bank agreed to settle for $67 million in a shareholder lawsuit civil case over robo-signing.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=592B0474-07A7-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

The result -- which CNBC reported was the biggest on record -- confounded expectations for a rise of 0.9%, according to a Wall Street Journal/Nikkei survey of economists.

Chinas exports, trade surplus miss forecasts	LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Chinese trade data for June surprised to the downside, though the result was still better than Mays performance, according to numbers out Thursday. Chinas exports rose 7.2% from a year earlier, better than a 7% gain in May but below a projected 10.6% rise from a Reuters survey of economists and an expected 10% improvement in a Wall Street Journal survey. Imports rose 5.5%, swinging from a 1.6% drop in May, with Reuters having called for a 5.8% gain and The Wall Street Journal tipping a 5.4% increase. The resulting trade surplus totaled $31.6 billion, missing a prediction for a $36.9 billion surplus from Wall Street Journal. It was also narrower than Mays $35.92 billion. Hong Kongs Hang Seng Index /quotes/zigman/2622475/delayed HK:HSI +0.26% fell to the flatline immediately after the data, down from a 0.2% gain, but it returned to its previous advance some minutes later as buyers stepped in. The Australian dollar /quotes/zigman/4867876/realtime/sampled AUDUSD -0.0669% , however, remained solidly lower, buying 93.99 U.S. cents compared to 94.12 U.S. cents before the numbers.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=66DE8540-6640-40BB-BB9A-30074F619765&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-09

U.S. jobless claims return near seven-year low	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The number of people who applied for unemployment benefits in the first week of July fell by 11,000 to 304,000, putting initial claims close to a seven-year bottom again and offering more evidence that U.S. hiring has accelerated while the rate of layoffs remains low. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected claims to total 320,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis. The average of new claims over the past month, meanwhile, declined by 3,500 to 311,500, the Labor Department said Thursday. The monthly figure, which is also just a hair above a seven-year low, offers a better look at underlying trends in the labor market. Also, the government said continuing claims increased by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 2.58 million in the week ended June 28. Continuing claims reflect the number of people already receiving benefits. Initial claims from two weeks ago were unrevised at 315,000.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=AE1A6431-D1A0-47F2-925B-3150B017F166&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10
Indonesia elections: Both candidates claim victory	By Ben OttoMr. Widodo, who saw his once-commanding lead in opinion polls evaporate in recent months, declared that he won based on unofficial vote tallies by independent organizations that showed him with a lead of 3-6 percentage points.Those organizations had been roughly accurate in using quick counts of a sampling of polling stations to predict results of April legislative elections.But Prabowo Subianto, a former army general from the era of authoritarian ruler Suharto, said he wouldn’t concede. His camp said pollsters used by his campaign indicated he likely won by as much as four percentage points.Mr. Subianto said he would announce his official stance only after those pollsters neared the end of their counts, while his campaign manager, Mohammad Mahfud, accused the Widodo camp of waging a “cyberwar” by spreading news of his win based on other pollsters. Official election results aren’t expected until after July 20.“It’s very close and divisive race,” said Yohanes Sulaiman, a lecturer at Indonesia Defense University. “I would’ve waited at least a few more hours until there was a definite count.”Hundreds of thousands of police and troops were deployed across the country to keep order before the polls opened, with the military cautioning that a margin of victory of less than 5% could lead to unrest in a nation where elections have largely been peaceful affairs.There were no signs of disorder throughout the polling day in the archipelago nation. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono called for calm from both sides. Supporters of the candidates planned gatherings later in the day.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com .Chinese hackers access U.S. personnel data: reportChina to offer electric-car tax break; Tesla may benefitFed plans to end bond purchases in October	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=AF27CA44-07F0-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Wells Fargo is almost ready to roll with the good times	By Philip van Doorn, MarketWatchThe fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets is expected by analysts polled by FactSet to report earnings of $1.01 a share on revenue of $20.83 billion, compared with $1.05 and $20.63 billion in the previous quarter (and 98 cents and $21.38 billion a year earlier).Large banks have suffered a decline in mortgage-banking revenue, since refinancing activity slowed considerably form a peak in the first quarter of 2013. For the first quarter of 2014, Wells Fargo /quotes/zigman/239557/delayed/quotes/nls/wfc WFC -0.11%  reported a 46% year-over-year decline in mortgage income to $1.51 billion. KBW analyst Fred Cannon, who rates Wells Fargo “market perform” (or hold), told clients Tuesday he thinks mortgage revenue will remain “essentially flat” in the second quarter from three months earlier.Another difficulty for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo could be its net interest margin, the spread between the average yield on loans and investments, and the average cost for deposits and borrowings. Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin, who rates Wells Fargo “buy” and has a $57 price target, predicts the margin will narrow to 3.17% in the second quarter from 3.20% in the first quarter and 3.46% from a year earlier. (The shares closed Tuesday at $52.25.)Historically low interest rates remain unfavorable for banks, hurt by the Federal Reserve’s policy of keeping the short-term federal funds rate in a range of zero to 0.25% since late 2008. Banks’ assets continue to reprice at lower rates, thus pressuring spreads.The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s June 17-18 meeting, released Wednesday, indicated the wind-down of the central bank’s “QE3” purchases of long-term U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities will be completed in October, two months earlier than expected by many economists. QE3 was designed to hold down long-term interest rates, and the end of the bond-buying program sets the stage for a higher federal funds rate, which dictates commercial rates.The good news for Wells Fargo, according to Usdin’s estimate, is that the bank’s second-quarter loan growth will be sufficient to grow its net interest income 1% sequentially and 2% from a year earlier to $10.94 billion.The stock: Wells Fargo’s shares have returned 17% this year through Tuesday’s close, following a 37% return during 2013. That is the best performance for any large-cap U.S. bank this year, and measures up remarkably well when compared with the KBW Bank Index /quotes/zigman/21809808/realtime BKX +0.38% , which is up only 4% after jumping 35% last year.Based on a quarterly payout of 35 cents, the shares have a dividend yield of 2.68%.During the past 10 years, Wells Fargo’s shares have returned 142%, while the KBW Bank Index has slumped 25%. Over five years, the shares have risen 151%, and the index has gained 107%. Several large regional banks have beaten Wells Fargo’s five-year return, as beaten-down companies rebounded big-time when the financial meltdown subsided.Wells Fargo is the biggest U.S. bank measured by market value, at $275 billion, even though three rivals boast more assets. Its strong stock performance reflects consistent earnings performance. The bank’s return on common equity has ranged from 12.19% to 13.99% over the past three full years, according to FactSet. Among the 24 components of the KBW Bank Index, only U.S. Bancorp /quotes/zigman/278238/delayed/quotes/nls/usb USB +0.44%  of Minneapolis has done better, with a ROCE ranging from 15.73% to 16.41%.The bull case: Wells Fargo has been a winner for long-term investors, having negotiated the low-interest-rate environment better than its rivals. The company more than doubled in size when it acquired Wachovia at the end of 2008, and aggressive credit impairment write-downs of purchased mortgage loans limited subsequent losses.The company has also fared better with regulators than its “big four” competitors, including Bank of America Corp. /quotes/zigman/190927/delayed/quotes/nls/bac BAC +0.13% , J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. /quotes/zigman/272085/delayed/quotes/nls/jpm JPM +0.47%  and Citigroup Inc. /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C -0.08% , in part, because it has a less complex business model.The return on common equity for first quarter was 14.09%, despite the narrowing margin and mortgage-revenue decline. And over the next several years, if short-term interest rates rise as most economists expect, the resulting increase in loan rates will boost the margin and net interest income, producing fatter profits.Another thing to consider is that Wells Fargo’s shares trade for 12.1 times the consensus 2015 EPS estimate of $4.32. That’s cheap, when considering the quality and consistency of earnings. The KBW Bank Index trades for 11.3 times 2015 earnings estimates, but the S&P 500 Index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.46%  is at 14.9.The big banks usually trade at significant discounts to the S&P 500, which makes sense because it seems they’ve tried to earn their customers’ ire with rising fees on everything and endless settlements. But in Wells Fargo’s case, the forward P/E ratio isn’t excessive.With a ROCE at these levels, even at a bad point in the interest-rate cycle, long-term investors — those who can commit for at least three years — are looking at an attractive investment.The bear case: Wells Fargo may report surprisingly bad mortgage or net-interest-income numbers, or its commercial loan-growth could disappoint investors. That could set up a painful pullback for this year’s strongest big-bank stock.Of course, long-term investors could see that as a buying opportunity.More from MarketWatch:6 companies that should report huge earnings gainsDow 17,000 is on the wrong side of history7 market myths that make investors poorer	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=34AF209C-0763-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Piketty’s cure for income inequality hurts the poor	By Diana Furchtgott-Roth, MarketWatchBut it is time for the French economist to move out of the limelight. Two eminent economics professors, Carnegie Mellon’s Allan Meltzer and the Wharton School’s Scott Richard, are challenging his conclusions with a new model and different data. Contrary to popular wisdom, they find that government redistribution increases inequality rather than reducing it.In their July 4 working paper, titled “ A Rational Theory of the Growth of Government and the Distribution of Income ,” Meltzer and Richard show that using redistribution to ameliorate income inequality is not only ineffective, but worsens the problem that policy makers seek to cure.Central to the Meltzer-Richard model is the assumption that technological progress happens through “learning by doing.” Since workers’ productivity levels increase with the more they produce, and because higher taxes create disincentives to working, taxes lead to lower economic growth.Meltzer and Richard assume that people act to maximize their lifetime utility and that the “median-voter theorem” holds. That means the median-income earner chooses the tax rate, so the tax rate selected will likely be higher than the rate chosen by those with income above the median.Higher tax rates that fund transfer payments hamper economic growth. That’s because they increase the number of people who depend on these payments and find it preferable not to work. There also is less learning-by-doing among those who work. This has been extensively documented by University of Chicago professor Casey Mulligan in his award-winning book, “The Redistribution Recession.” As taxes and transfers rise, hours of work and acquired skills decline, reducing economic growth.Meltzer and Richard are the first to show formally that it is this decline in hours worked for low-productivity workers that leads to more economic inequality — not the growth of technology nor the rent-seeking privileges of the rich, two causes cited by Piketty. Reduced effort by the rich in reaction to higher taxes comes at the expense of economic growth, which has the potential to raise everyone’s living standards and increase economic opportunity.For developing economies, such as India and China, the rate of economic growth increases quickly, because they can copy technology from mature economies. The result is a high rate of economic growth that slows over time, as promising technologies are integrated. As the growth rate of the economy slows, the rate of government growth increases due to a slowing of the “learning by doing” mechanism. This larger government, as measured by a higher tax rate, leads to more income inequality.Picketty sees the subsequent income inequality as the result of an economy increasingly rewarding the wealthy. But Meltzer and Richard show that the growth of government is the true driver behind inequality.In a mature economy, what drives the rate of economic growth is the business cycle, not the catch-up effect of copying existing technology from other countries. When computers were invented, the productivity of office workers increased relative to agricultural workers. More unequal levels of productivity mean more unequal wages, making it more likely that the median voter will choose to increase tax rates, leading to more income inequality.A similar outcome can result from immigration of low-skill workers. If more low-productivity workers migrate to the United States, the distribution of relative productivity will become less equal, also resulting in the median voter being more likely to choose a higher tax rate.Meltzer and Richard use data from the Census Bureau and the St. Louis Federal Reserve bank to test their predictions for the U.S. Taking advantage of a data series that begins in 1967 and ends in 2011, they track changes in tax rates, average hours worked, mean and median household incomes, and productivity, among other variables. Their model predicts that the rate of productivity growth (the “learning by doing” mechanism) grew over time, until declining post-2007. Comparing their estimates of productivity, tax rates and income inequality, they find their estimates closely match what actually happened.In the discussions of income inequality that have become so popular today, the government’s power to redistribute tax revenue is frequently touted as being a tool to narrow the income gap between the rich and the poor. Meltzer and Richard show that even though higher taxation may lead to less inequality in terms of consumption, it eventually leads to higher levels of inequality in terms of income. That is an important result that cannot be ignored.More from MarketWatch:What Piketty and prostitution have in commonA bold plan for Pope Francis, Bill Gates to save the world4 easy ways to boost the U.S. economy	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5D9336F4-076F-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Ending unemployment benefits didn’t cut jobless rate	By Rex Nutting, MarketWatchThere is no evidence that those who had been receiving benefits were suddenly motivated to find jobs once the checks ran out. The improvement in the jobless rate is due to a stronger economy, not the elimination of those benefits, as many conservatives claim.The Republican argument has always been that millions of people would rather collect half a paycheck for doing nothing than work for a living. If they weren’t getting benefits, these supposed deadbeats would either try harder to find a job or they’d officially drop out of the labor force because they never really wanted to work anyway.We can now test that theory. And we find it wanting. People who lost their benefits did not grab the first job they could, nor did they simply give up trying.The Republicans shut down the gravy train at the beginning of the year, killing the program that gave benefits to people who had been out of work longer than six months, which is the usual time limit in most states. Since then, about 3.2 million people have lost their benefits, which averaged about $300 a week.If the Republicans are right, those 3.2 million people should either take any job they can get or drop out of the labor force en masse. In either case, the unemployment rate would fall.And it has. Coincidentally or not, the unemployment rate has fallen from 6.7% in December to 6.1% in June. Job growth has accelerated since the beginning of the year, averaging 231,000 a month, compared with 185,000 in the last six months of 2013.And, best of all, long-term unemployment has decreased by nearly 800,000 since December to 3.1 million in June.Republicans say the drop in the jobless rate proves they were right to kill the extended unemployment compensation program.“The debate on that extension is over, and the conservatives were right,” declared conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer on Fox News. Arthur Delaney of Huffington Post did a nice roundup of the Republican gloating.Danny Vinik of the New Republic laments that “we don’t actually know why long-term unemployment is falling.” It could be that the long-term unemployed are settling for any job they can find, but “we don’t know if that’s happening.”But we do know. We know that the end of the benefits didn’t significantly change the rate at which these people were finding work or dropping out of the work force.The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps records on flows in and out of the labor market, into employment or unemployment. Some of these data are published , but information breaking down flows by duration of unemployment is not published by the BLS. But it does exist.The unpublished labor-force flow statistics show that the long-term unemployed are getting jobs at a slightly faster rate this year. Each month, about 13% of the people who have been out of work longer than 26 weeks are getting a job, compared with 11% or 12% for most of 2013.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5342AD3E-0791-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

U.S. stocks: Futures plunge as Fed minutes sink in	By Barbara Kollmeyer, MarketWatchWeekly jobless claims and a speech from a key Federal Reserve member are ahead, while Costco Wholesale Corp. could see action after same-store sales, and as another retailer was poised for more losses.Losses ramped up for futures through Europe’s morning.

Kansas City Fed President Esther George will speak on the economy and monetary policy in Oklahoma at 1.15 p.m. Eastern Time.Stocks closed modestly higher on Wednesday, after the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting revealed policy makers planned to end the Fed’s bond-buying program by October if the economy stays on track. The S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.46%  gained 0.5% to 1,972.83.But markets seem to be having second thoughts on Thursday. Within those minutes, noted James Hughes, chief market analyst at Alpari, were Fed concerns that the recent volatility in financial markets is proof investors aren’t factoring in a more hawkish central-bank approach.“The complacency point is actually really a key point to these markets at the moment,” said Hughes, who notes that investors arent facing monetary change only in the U.S., but in Europe and the U.K., as well. “Any rally like this, which has been so strong and built on such low volatility — any kind of surprise will just flip the switch on this, and there will be no foundations to hold it together.”He said the Dow industrials’ /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.47%  failure to hold on to 17,000 is a sign of a “psychological cap” for markets.In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 index /quotes/zigman/2380150/delayed XX:SXXP -1.32%   logged a fifth day of losses, dropping 1.4% as banks tumbled.

Italy’s industrial production unexpectedly fell 1.2% in May, the biggest decline since November 2012, and French production also surprised with a 1.7% drop, the largest fall in more than 18 months.Investors were also watching for the latest policy decision from the Bank of England.The Nikkei 225 index /quotes/zigman/5986735/delayed JP:NIK -0.56%  fell 0.6%, but other Asian markets were flat or slightly higher. Chinese trade data for June surprised to the downside: up 7.2% in June from a year earlier, which was better than a 7% gain in May, but far below the 10% rise expected from economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.As stock futures fell, gold pushed sharply higher, with August futures /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +1.44%  surging $20.20, or 1.5%, to $1,344.60 an ounce. Oil prices were mostly lower, while the dollar /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY +0.08%  also stayed higher.Retailers may grab some attention as well on Wall Street for Thursday.

Emerging markets stocks are still a lousy investment	By Howard GoldInvestors have responded as they usually do: by chasing performance. After having pulled $11.6 billion from EM stock exchange traded funds from January to March, “the tide really began to turn. Lately investors have been buying emerging markets,” TrimTabs CEO David Santschi says.They’re likely chasing rainbows again.As I’ve written here, here and here, people invest in emerging markets on a demonstrably false premise: that higher economic growth leads to higher stock market returns. The evidence is clear that stock market returns don’t have much to do with GDP growth.Also, leading emerging market mutual funds and ETFs are heavily weighted towards the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), three of which are in secular bear markets. (Only India is still in a long-term bull market.) The two largest emerging market ETFs have more than 40% of their holdings in the BRICs.And the U.S.’s huge debt load and the Federal Reserve’s massive bond buying have prompted some investors (mostly hard-money libertarians) to abandon U.S. stocks for emerging markets, whose monetary policies they deem more sound.This position, which seems as much political as economic, is advocated by doom-and-gloomer Peter Schiff, among others.How’s that working out? Not great. U.S. stocks have vastly outperformed emerging markets for the past two, three and five years.That shouldn’t be surprising. During that time, researchers have found far more evidence that emerging markets aren’t the super performers so many investors still think they are.Early this year, three of the world’s leading experts on equity returns — Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton of the London Business School — built a new index of long-term emerging markets stock performance for Credit Suisse’s 2014 Investment Returns Yearbook.They found that developed markets actually beat emerging markets by 8.3% to 7.7% a year from 1900 through 2013. (Since 1950, however, EM have outperformed developed markets by 12.5% to 10.8% annually.)EM stocks also are much more volatile than either the U.S. or other developed markets. According to Morningstar, over a 10-year period, EM stocks have a standard deviation of 23.9, 30% higher than developed market stocks and 60% more variable than the S&P 500 Index.A new white paper published by BlackRock looked at 10 major emerging economies and found that since 1992, emerging stock markets, on average, captured only 73% of the GDP growth of their host countries. So, if an economy was growing by, say, 8% a year, its stock market returned only 5.8% to investors.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8C9F26FC-0791-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

U.S. stocks: Futures plunge on Fed, Portugal bank woes	By Barbara Kollmeyer, MarketWatchWeekly jobless claims and a speech from a key Federal Reserve member are ahead, while Costco Wholesale Corp. could see action after same-store sales, and as another retailer was poised for more losses.Losses ramped up for futures through Europe’s morning. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/21524673/delayed DJU4 -0.84%  sank 144 points, or 0.9%, to 16,769, while those for the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/11777331/delayed SPU4 -0.87%  tumbled 17 points, or 0.9%, to 1,950.20. Futures for the Nasdaq-100 index /quotes/zigman/17563580/delayed NDU4 -0.89%  dropped 31.50 points, or 0.8%, to 3,854.Weekly jobless claims are due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, and economists expects claims will rise to 320,000 in the seven days ended July 5, from 315,000 in the prior week. At 10 a.m. Eastern Time, the government will issue wholesale inventories for May. Inventories increased 1.1% in April. Jobless claims likely to stay low, reflect improved labor marketAlso Thursday, Stanley Fischer will give his first major speech as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, on financial reform in Cambridge, Mass. Kansas City Fed President Esther George will speak on the economy and monetary policy in Oklahoma at 1.15 p.m. Eastern Time.Stocks closed modestly higher on Wednesday, after the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting revealed policy makers planned to end the Fed’s bond-buying program by October if the economy stays on track. The S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.46%  gained 0.5% to 1,972.83.But markets seem to be having second thoughts on Thursday. Within those minutes, noted James Hughes, chief market analyst at Alpari, were Fed concerns that the recent volatility in financial markets is proof investors aren’t factoring in a more hawkish central-bank approach.“The complacency point is actually really a key point to these markets at the moment,” said Hughes, who notes that investors arent facing monetary change only in the U.S., but in Europe and the U.K., as well. “Any rally like this, which has been so strong and built on such low volatility — any kind of surprise will just flip the switch on this, and there will be no foundations to hold it together.”He said the Dow industrials’ /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.47%  failure to hold on to 17,000 is a sign of a “psychological cap” for markets.Some blamed Europe’s troubles for U.S. losses. The Stoxx Europe 600 index /quotes/zigman/2380150/delayed XX:SXXP -1.16%   logged a fifth day of losses, dropping 1.4% as banks tumbled. Portugal’s PSI 20 /quotes/zigman/3171650/delayed PT:PSI20 -4.31% /quotes/zigman/3171650/delayed PT:PSI20 -4.31% skidded nearly 4% after Espirito Santo Financial Group SA /quotes/zigman/174284/delayed PT:ESF -8.85% , the controlling lender of Banco Espirito Santo SA CA:BES 0.00% , suspended trading its own shares and bonds, citing “ongoing material difficulties.”Banco Espirito, which was still trading, plunged 15%, while other Portuguese banks and banks across southern Europe fell in tandem.But Keith McCullough, chief executive officer at Hedgeye Risk Management, said investors shouldn’t look to Portugal as an explanation for why futures are crumbling.“To blame a globally interconnected market of massive risks on Portugal is lame. This move in U.S. bond yields (straight down since the jobs report headfake), gold (straight up) and U.S. mo-mo stocks (straight down mon-tue) is the bigger picture of risk,” he said in emailed comments.Europe also had bad data. Italy’s industrial production unexpectedly fell 1.2% in May, the biggest decline since November 2012, and French production also surprised with a 1.7% drop, the largest fall in more than 18 months.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C3BD3BAE-0806-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10
How a parent’s health-care bills could hurt you	Many older people moving into a nursing home or retirement community are experiencing cognitive decline. In legal terms, they no longer have the capacity to make financial or medical decisions for themselves. So a trusted person—usually an adult child—will sign the entrance contract on their behalf as power of attorney.Yet elder law attorneys report a widespread misunderstanding of what it means to sign a contract for a cognitively impaired loved one, whether that person is entering a care facility or simply signing off on a cellphone agreement. If you sign your name in lieu of your parent’s on a contract without adding any additional language, then you’re not just stating that you’ll make payments on your parent’s behalf using your parent’s money.Instead, you’re in effect acting as a guarantor who is personally responsible for the payments.Issues like this create problems for families in a few spending areas, including hospital and doctors’ bills not covered by insurance, which a patient or patient’s representative usually signs for in advance of treatment. But the stakes are particularly high when it comes to a retirement facility or nursing home, given the vulnerable nature of the residents and fees that can reach $10,000 monthly at some places.“They’ll call it Responsible Party with a capital R and a capital P,” said Shirley B. Whitenack, a partner with Schenck, Price, Smith & King in Florham Park, N.J. and president-elect of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys. “Make sure it’s not you.” Unknowing family members may think “responsible party” is a contact person to be notified in the case of emergency.Estate plans usually involve what’s known as a “durable” power of attorney. These allow the trusted individual—legally, the “agent”—to retain power of attorney even when the person who created the document—the “principal”—has become incapacitated. (Older people who retain their faculties should always sign documents for themselves, elder law attorneys say.)If you’re named the agent for your parents on a financial power of attorney document, you will have access to your parents’ bank and brokerage accounts to pay the retirement or nursing home on their behalf. But unless you want to personally guarantee the payments, you’ll have to take an extra step when signing the residential contract, experts say.The best way to separate your responsibility as power of attorney from any personal financial obligation is to sign your parent’s name as the responsible party on the contract, and after that write, “by [your name] as power of attorney,” followed by the date, said Bradley J. Frigon, an elder law attorney in Denver and president of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys.Those who don’t take this step will generally find themselves on the hook if payments aren’t made. This means that the nursing home or retirement community can come after you if your parents run out of money. If you don’t pay the fees, then they could send a collection agency after you. Failure to pay could also affect your credit score. Worse yet, it could cause the facility to take steps to evict your loved one.What’s more, many retirement communities will only deal with one responsible party per resident, said Andrew Carle, executive in residence at the program in senior housing administration at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. and a former retirement community administrator. Oftentimes, a group of siblings will come in and say they plan to split the fees among themselves each month.That kind of internal agreement is fine, Carle said, as long as the checks come from one person. A facility can’t be put in a position to juggle multiple checks from multiple family members, or to act as a mediator if family members disagree.An adult child who mistakenly signs on as guarantor can mess up a parent’s Medicaid application, Frigon said. A state-administered program, Medicaid pays certain long-term care expenses for those who have exhausted their assets and meet strict income criteria.Facilities that take Medicaid—not all do—cannot reject Medicaid payments made on a resident’s behalf because the adult child mistakenly signed on as guarantor, Frigon said. Yet that mistake could result in a processing delay before the older person is approved to go on Medicaid, during which time the guarantor is responsible for continuing to pay the rent and all other fees, Frigon noted.“The power of attorney is great,” Frigon said, “but you have understand what your liability is.”Also on MarketWatch:How to go 40 years without a paycheck401(k)s face a crisis, says Nobelist MertonRetirement communities: Read the contract.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E60B1C00-06C9-11E4-91DE-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10
Family Dollar earnings decline, miss targets	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Family Dollar /quotes/zigman/226252/delayed/quotes/nls/fdo FDO -0.22% reported Thursday fiscal third-quarter net earnings of $81.1 million, or 71 cents a share, down from $120.9 million, or $1.05 a share in the same period a year ago. Excluding one-time items, earnings for the quarter ending May 31 were 85 cents a share versus the average estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet of 89 cents a share. Revenue rose 3.3% to $2.66 billion, compared with the FactSet concensus analyst estimate of $2.62 billion. The discount retailer expects fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents to 85 cents, surrounding the FactSet concensus analyst EPS estimate of 78 cents, and projects same-store sales for the quarter to be about flat. Family Dollars stock was indicated slightly lower in premarket trade.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5EC42A3A-0F93-4B54-90E3-6F785E25ADB8&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Murderer turned stock-picker is ‘Oracle of San Quentin’	By Catey Hill, MarketWatchAmong the inmates in California’s sprawling San Quentin State Prison, Carroll’s violent past is ordinary—but his present is anything but. In a place where physical toughness is the main way to earn respect, Carroll has built a following among his fellow prisoners by teaching them how to stay out of debt, draw up a budget—and pick stocks.His friends call him “Wall Street.” In prison, that’s a compliment.“From what I hear, I’m one of a kind,” he tells me when I meet him for an interview. A fast-talking man with a swagger befitting an A-list celebrity, Carroll greets me with an assured nod from behind black aviator sunglasses. Trim, short and clean-cut, he looks a decade younger than his years. “There is not a lot of people who’ve been doing what I’ve been doing, created what I’ve created,” he says.That’s certainly true. At a time when financial literacy is barely taught even outside of prison, the classes Carroll conducts for fellow inmates represent an unusual effort to reach an undereducated population. (See also: What prison inmates learn about money.)It’s an outcome that’s all the more unlikely because Carroll, by his own account, was illiterate when he got to prison. Now, he says, he reads The Wall Street Journal every day. He invokes Warren Buffett in conversation as one of his idols—and in homage to Buffett, one prison official calls Carroll “the Oracle of San Quentin.”Carroll’s interest in investing goes back more than a decade, but his influence has grown since 2012, when he was transferred to this prison, a huge facility that hosts one of the country’s biggest prison education programs. Here, his experience and confidence have helped him turn dozens of people into “clients” who take his advice—including non-inmates who volunteer at the prison.“Everything he says is stuff you hear” from other financial talking heads, says Tom De Martini, an insurance agent who took classes from Carroll while volunteering. “But…to be doing it behind prison walls, it’s so impressive.” Another volunteer, photography professor Nigel Poor, says she invested in stocks for the first time after hearing Carroll. “I am 50; I wish someone had taught me this when I was 20,” Poor says. Fellow inmate Troy Williams says that most books about investing are “geared towards people with money,” but Carroll “has strategies for everyday, common people.”Carroll says his lessons are designed to help his fellow inmates avoid hopelessness and crime. They’re also bucking a national trend: A Rand Corp. study published last year found that budget cuts were depressing the number of courses and students in many prison programs.But Carroll is quick to add that his interests aren’t simply academic, or altruistic. “I go where the money goes—it’s always been that way,” he says; and the money for him, these days, is in stocks.Or at least, it’s there in theory. It isn’t possible to independently assess Carroll’s track record: While he says he has brokerage accounts of his own, records that he shared with MarketWatch weren’t complete enough to gauge how well his investments have performed. As for his advice, it’s a mixed bag—some quite good, some risky and speculative, and most of it brand-new territory for a clientele that lives behind prison walls.***Carroll says his family never had much money--they lived on welfare and bounced around from the streets to homeless shelters to churches to apartments in and around Oakland, Calif. He vividly remembers the day his mother got a windfall and bought him and his brother new bikes—and the day, not long after, when a local drug dealer took the bikes as repayment for his mom’s debts.But Carroll befriended the dealer’s son—and eventually made friends with the dealer, too. He recalls wishing for a new pair of “red, bright-colored shoes” from LA Gear: While his mom couldn’t afford those coveted shoes, the drug dealer could.“He took me to the mall and bought me some,” Carroll says. “That is really when I started to, like, see the money as the means to everything—people with the money got the power,” he says.It didn’t take Carroll long to find a way to make money of his own. At a bowling alley where his mother worked as a waitress, an older man taught Carroll a grift: Curtis would play arcade games, distracting the alley owners while the man broke into the back of the machine and stole quarters. Soon, Carroll learned how to do the break-ins himself. “That became a part of my main source of income,” he says.His newfound wealth was like a high to him, Carroll says: At some points, he’d have as much as $5,000, which he’d hide in a pillowcase buried in leaves in the woods, or in the wall at home behind his martial-arts plaque. At high school, “I used to take $5 bills and $1 bills and throw them into the crowd, just to see them go crazy.”But as he got older, Carroll’s criminality caught up to him. His arcade-game robberies landed him in juvenile hall, he says. And in 1996, when he was 17, he and two friends were involved in the fatal shooting of a young man named Gilberto Medina Gil, in what police said was a botched robbery attempt. Carroll was accused of being the shooter; three years later, a jury convicted him of murder.According to court records, a witness told police that Carroll told him, “I never thought I could pull a trigger like that.” Today, he says that his crime was “heinous”; he also says that he tried to send money to the victim’s family, something MarketWatch couldnt independently confirm.***In one sense, the conversion from Curtis Carroll to “Wall Street” began before the jury found him guilty. Carroll, who used to pay other kids to do his homework for him, says he couldn’t read the court papers his lawyer put in front of him. “I don’t know if my lawyer ever knew” about his illiteracy, he says. Carroll is quick to add that illiteracy doesn’t excuse his crime. Still, he says, “Being illiterate is like being in a bubble. Being uneducated affects the way people move in life, it affects what they become in life.”It took a while for that lesson to sink in. When he first got to prison, he was assigned a female reading tutor, and he had far more interest in her looks than her brains. “I wouldn’t mind going out there to look at a woman—I’m in jail,” he says. “I’m thinking I’m going to use the pages [as rolling papers] to smoke weed or something.”Carroll says it wasn’t until he accidentally grabbed the business section of a newspaper—he was trying to get the sports section so that his cellmate could read it to him--that he had a light-bulb moment about reading. “An older [inmate] asked me if I played the stock market. I said ‘What’s that?’ and he says, ‘It’s a place where white people keep their money.’”“The first thing I thought was, this has got to be where it’s at,” he says. “If I can read, I can find out about this business stuff…Money is gonna be gotten somehow.”***By the time Carroll had his epiphany, of course, the Internet was upending the way investors track the markets. For most inmates, access to the Internet is a rare privilege. So Carroll has taught himself the way someone might have done in the 1950s—by poring over stock quotes in newspaper financial sections. When we meet, he shows me stacks of binders filled with hundreds of pages of stock prices he’s copied over the years.Our interview took place in a shared library and classroom used by San Quentin’s education program, a room cluttered with books and mismatched office furniture. One wall is plastered with a list of stocks Carroll has picked, next to their prices at the time that he selected them. Carroll posted them on the wall, he tells me, to convince the prison’s public information officer, Lt. Samuel Robinson, that his stock-picking “wasn’t just a bunch of shenanigans” aimed at defrauding fellow inmates. “In prison, you run across a lot of people who will con you, with visions of grandeur,” Robinson says. But he adds that once he got to know Wall Street, he came to trust him. “You’re not sitting down with a dummy,” he adds. “This guy is sharp.”Since Carroll learned reading and investing simultaneously, it isn’t coincidental that for him, stocks are about stories and emotions. When he’s thinking about investing in a stock, he says, he explains the basics of the company to other inmates, and gauges their reactions. “Psychology runs 70% of the markets,” he says. “Investors play follow-the-leader--if they didn’t, we wouldn’t have the 1%.”Quoting Buffett—“Be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy”—Carroll argues that the best opportunities to profit come when “people panic about stupid stuff.” His hypothetical example: Bill Gates dies in a plane crash and investors sell Microsoft stock, even though Bill Gates hasn’t been directly involved in the company’s operations in years. For Carroll, of course, that would be an opportunity.The picks on the wall include Zynga /quotes/zigman/7720406/delayed/quotes/nls/znga ZNGA -0.99%  , Bank of America /quotes/zigman/190927/delayed/quotes/nls/bac BAC +0.13%   and Facebook /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB +3.52%  , which Carroll says he bought in December of 2012. What the three stocks had in common at the time: Each was getting substantial bad press—most notably Facebook, thanks to investor malaise after its disappointingly muddled IPO. Those stocks are up 20%, 47% and 134%, respectively, since December 14, 2012; over that same stretch the S&P 500 is up 39%.Carroll also stresses the importance of reading beyond financial publications. His magazine list includes some highly unlikely fare for a men’s prison, including Teen Vogue (great for insight into things that teens adopt first, like social media); PopStar! (to keep up with the entertainment industry) and Shape (for fitness innovations and products).Stock picking is now, Carroll says, at the level of obsession: “Fun is, like, an understatement, it’s life.”***For most inmates, though stock-picking isn’t life, or at least not real life.Carl Takei, a staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, says that it is generally legal for an incarcerated criminal to have assets outside of prison (though the state could seize assets as part of his sentence or in a separate proceeding). But he notes that most inmates aren’t earning money (at least not legally) to invest: If they’re investing at all, they’re most likely tapping into family funds or assets they had before they went to prison. And most have little or nothing to work with. Nearly 60% of the prison population reports a pre-arrest personal income of less than $1,000 a month (and 84% less than $2,000 a month), according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics; and nearly one in three reports that they weren’t employed before going to prison.Communication with banks and brokers can be difficult from behind bars, so inmates that do invest typically have someone on the outside make the investments for them, says Takei. (That’s what Carroll says he does; an outside contact through whom he says he invests didnt return calls requesting an interview.)Plastered to the wall of our meeting room is a sheet of what he calls “the timeless rules of personal finance,” which are:These eat-your-vegetables rules don’t seem to excite “Wall Street” as much as stock-picking does (one more way his experience mirrors the real Wall Street). But he says they’re a big component of the classes he teaches. Many prisoners spend any money they do have while behind bars, he says--most of it on unnecessary items like tobacco--and have nothing left over. Carroll has fellow inmates track their spending so they can see what’s coming in and going out. “I want them to have discipline when they get on the streets,” he says.When he pivots from these financial-literacy basics to his ideas about playing the market, though, Carroll can wind up on shaky ground. Carroll is a fan of penny stocks, for example. He says he likes them because someone like an inmate, who doesn’t have a lot of money, can afford to buy several shares. But he doesn’t address the fact that these companies’ shares are often cheap because they’re financially shaky, and that investors in penny stocks are particularly vulnerable to fraud.Carroll says he recommends specific stocks to inmates, and he uses a relatively simple questionnaire about basic financial statistics to help his students screen stocks. But he’s smoothly evasive when I ask him about which specific stocks he likes right now, changing the subject to broader topics.The bigger issue, in the eyes of most investing pros, is whether inexperienced investors with modest means should be buying individual stocks at all. If you have only a small pot of savings, betting a large share of it on just a few stocks exposes you to more risk (violating Carroll’s own Rule #4, about diversification). Alex McAdams, personal finance analyst for the consumer financial site NerdWallet, is one of many advisers who advocate index funds for lower-income investors. “Is it possible that you could have an insight [about a stock] that the rest of the market doesn’t recognize?” she asks. “Absolutely. Is it likely? Statistically, no.”***It’s telling, and maybe encouraging, that outsiders seem to take away different lessons from Carroll’s teaching than inmates do. Nigel Poor, the photography professor who is working on a project to help tell prisoner’s stories, said she was initially put off by Carroll’s obsession with money. But she found Wall Street’s classes “eye-opening” -- and says that afterward she “realized I hadn’t really thought about my [financial] future.”Thanks to Carroll’s class, Poor says, she bought her first stock last year: Hewlett-Packard /quotes/zigman/229302/delayed XE:HWP -1.25%  , which has risen from about $23 per share when she bought it, to about $33 per share today (a return that beats the broader market). De Martini, the insurance agent, says that hearing Carroll talk about Twitter /quotes/zigman/23556538/delayed/quotes/nls/twtr TWTR +1.74%   last September inspired him to buy it at its November IPO; he later “got out and made some profit on that.” (Twitter fell below its initial share price this April and has remained below it since then.) De Martini says he also made some money on American Apparel /quotes/zigman/1511249/delayed/quotes/nls/app APP +1.12%   after hearing details about it in the class, but he cautions that in his opinion a lot of Wall Street’s advice is “highly speculative” and risky.For fellow inmates--many of whom didn’t graduate high school and haven’t had a “real” job in their lives—the message may be a simpler one, of empowerment. Troy Williams, who’s in prison for robbery, says he plans to apply what’s he’s learned in prison about budgeting and saving to his everyday life when he gets out. And Williams, like others, expresses admiration for Carroll’s chops as a teacher. “In most classes people drop out, but in his class everyone kept coming every week,” De Martini says. “They’re engaged.”Carroll says he hopes that the engagement pays off—that inmates who might otherwise turn or return to crime upon their release can instead try to get their money in legitimate ways. “It’s another way to give them hope,” he says.Will the Oracle of San Quentin get a chance to practice what he preaches? It’s hard to say. If he serves his full sentence, he’s not eligible for release until 2053. But in a recent email, Robinson, the prison official, told MarketWatch that because Carroll committed his crime as a juvenile, he could get a parole review as soon as the year 2020.The Oracle’s response, filtered through Robinson: “He is excited about that.”Also on MarketWatch:Confessions of an insider traderMadoff: ‘Don’t let Wall Street scam you like I did’	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B2300290-07AC-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10
How prison inmates learn about money	By Catey Hill, MarketWatchAnd then there were financial things that he’d simply never learned, before or during incarceration, like budgeting. “While I was in [prison], I’d lived on $18 per month,” he says. Now, his wife wanted his help paying bills, balancing the checkbook, paying the mortgage, saving money each month. “I told her, ‘You’re going to have to take this slow with me,’” he says.Thanks in part to this experience, Tijerina started a nonprofit, The Ridge Project, to help other prisoners learn life coping skills, including financial basics. “I was so lucky I had my wife to help me,” he says. “Not everyone has that.”There may be more important skills for many prisoners to learn, like impulse management, but some experts say financial literacy is one of the most important. “Many times people come in without having learned even basic financial literacy,” says Carl Takei, a staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project; then, when they get into prison, many don’t deal with financial transactions at all except for at the commissary (and even then, they don’t touch the cash).Judi Lewen, the executive director of the Prison University Project at San Quentin State Prison in California, says that some prisoners have been in for so long that they don’t know how to use a computer or a credit or debit card; others have never had a bank account or written or deposited a check. Those are skills they’ll need in the outside world, to do everything from rent an apartment, to lease a car to pay bills. “In terms of the person living a normal life and not ending up back in jail, financial literacy is a big part of the equation,” says Lee Gimpel, a spokesperson for Money Habitudes, a financial literacy organization. (Indeed, prison education in general may play a part in reforming criminals: A Rand Corp. study from last year showed that inmates who participated in education programs while behind bars had a 43% lower chance of recidivism than those who did not.)(See also: Murderer turned stock-picker is ‘Oracle of San Quentin.’)That said, while roughly 90% of prisons offer some sort of education program, it isn’t clear exactly how many prisons offer personal finance courses. Randy Radic, the editor for PrisonEducation.com, says that he thinks few do, largely because there isn’t funding for classes like this; because of this, some of the personal finance classes offered are taught by volunteer organizations (like The Ridge Project) and even the inmates themselves.During the recession, funding got cut for education programs in many prisons, and there’s also evidence that participation rates in any kind of education program have been declining .Still, patches of education remain. It was through a fellow inmate--a former stockbroker--prisoner Christopher Zoukis, 28, began to learn personal finance. (Zoukis is an inmate in FCC Petersburg near Richmond, Virginia, and is he doing time for charges related to possession of child pornography.) Zoukis admits that, “I’d never seen a pay stub when I came here,” he says. “And I think [that’s] the case for a lot of guys in here…they have never held traditional employment.” But through the stockbroker’s course, Zoukis is learning a broader range of material. “We learned how to manage money, create and abide by a budget, and other things like that,” he says. Zoukis adds that without this information, “prisoners come to feel that the law-abiding world is a world restricted from them,” he says.To be sure, financial literacy courses for prisoners are usually far from a comprehensive take on what the inmates will need to know. “While we think financial management is basic, some people first need basic math--addition, subtraction, multiplication,” says Lewen.Furthermore, there is debate on how well financial-literacy education works even when it’s taught by pros. A study published this year in the journal Management Science looked at 168 studies on the relationship between financial literacy and financial knowledge and found that “interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples” and that “even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention” -- not exactly a positive message for financial literacy’s efficacy.Still, some experts say it’s a worthy endeavor--even if it’s just the basics. “It’s immensely important,” says Cornell law professor Robert Hockett. “So few Americans actually have good financial educations,” -- whether they’re in prison or otherwise.Also on MarketWatch:Confessions of an insider traderMadoff: ‘Don’t let Wall Street scam you like I did’	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=29613B22-07AD-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Jobless claims fall to nearly a 7-year low	By Jeffry Bartash, MarketWatchInitial jobless claims declined by 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 304,000 in the period of June 29 to July 5, the Labor Department said Thursday. That’s the lowest level in seven weeks and just slightly higher than a 298,000 reading in early May that was the smallest claims figure since mid-2007.Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected claims to climb to 320,000 from an unrevised 315,000 in the week ended June 28.Jobless claims, however, can be quite volatile from week to week and July is one of the most difficult months for the government to measure.A sizable number of educational employees such as bus drivers or cafeteria workers are often laid off during the summer, for instance, and that appeared to boost the number of new claims in the last week of June. What’s more, some major manufacturers such as carmakers shut down plants briefly in July to retool, though that has appeared to happen less often in the past few years amid an improved business climate.Labor officials said there was nothing unusual in the latest claims report.In any case, the average of new claims over the past month declined by 3,500 to 311,500 and it was also just a hair above a seven-year low. The four-week average smooths out the volatility in the weekly number and offers a better look at underlying trends in the labor market.Initial jobless claims are a gauge of whether layoffs are rising or falling and changes in the number of people seeking benefits tend to correlate over time with how many jobs the economy is producing.In June, the economy generated a net 288,000 jobs, preliminary government figures showed last week. That marked the first time since 1999 that the U.S. has added 200,000 jobs or more for five straight months. And the unemployment rate dropped to a six-year low of 6.1% from 6.3% in May.So far in 2014 the economy has gained an average of 231,000 jobs a month — 19% faster than last year’s pace of 194,000. The past six months mark one of the best stretches of hiring since the recession ended in mid-2009.Meanwhile, the government said continuing claims increased by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 2.58 million in the week ended June 28. Continuing claims reflect the number of people already receiving benefits.More from MarketWatchTeens can’t read a paycheck (wait till they have to pay for their own cell phones)22 potential earning season investment gems	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5A5840E8-0827-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

30-year-mortgage rate rises to 4.15%	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.15% in the week that ended July 10 from 4.12% in the prior week, according to a Thursday report from federally controlled mortgage-buyer Freddie Mac /quotes/zigman/226335/delayed/quotes/nls/fmcc FMCC -1.53% . A year ago, the 30-year rate was at 4.51%. Mortgage rates increased for the week as the labor market appears to be improving, said Frank Nothaft, Freddies chief economist. The average rate for the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 3.24% in the latest week from 3.22% in the prior week. Meanwhile, the rate for a 5-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage ticked up to 2.99% from 2.98%, and the rate for a 1-year Treasury-indexed ARM increased to 2.40% from 2.38%.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=597F312F-A13C-41C2-8574-1B55D8A2BB75&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10
SEC poised to finalize money-fund rules	By Andrew AckermanThe Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to vote on a plan as early as this month that would require certain money funds catering to large, institutional investors to abandon their fixed $1 share price and float in value like other mutual funds, these people said.The plan also would allow money funds to temporarily block investors from withdrawing their money in times of stress or require a fee to redeem shares. Such so-called redemption limits come over the objections of other regulators, including members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, who have said such restrictions could spur, rather than curb, investor stampedes.The long-awaited rules are aimed at making the $2.6 trillion money fund industry less prone to investor runs during periods of market tumult by training investors to accept fluctuations in the value of their investments and ensuring funds could stop a trickle of outflows from turning into a deluge.SEC Chairman Mary Jo White has been under pressure from U.S. and global regulators to fix structural vulnerabilities posed by the funds.Want to read the latest and most interesting stories and analysis to come out of D.C.?

Why some say growing demand for soccer gear will last	By Christian Flores of Medill News Service“There’s been a lot of excitement around the World Cup and it’s re-engaged the casual soccer fan and player,” said Jason Karlowski, manager of sports marketing and public relations for New York-based Modell’s Sporting Goods.Up to this point, sporting goods stores have seen an uptick in soccer merchandise sales since the World Cup began last month.“We’ve seen increases in not only World Cup and [Major League Soccer] merchandise but generic soccer balls, shin guards and cleats,” Karlowski said.Adidas /quotes/zigman/619210/delayed DE:ADS -0.18%  , official sponsor and supplier of the World Cup, said last month it is on pace to sell more than 8 million jerseys worldwide during this year’s tournament, a more than 20% jump from the 6.5 million jerseys it sold in 2010.Nike’s /quotes/zigman/235840/delayed/quotes/nls/nke NKE -1.52%  final quarter sales figures revealed $2.7 billion in revenue from soccer alone for fiscal year 2014, a 21% increase from the same time last year. Even though sporting goods stores are cashing in now, some wonder whether if it’s a good idea just yet for retailers to continue devoting a large chunk of floor space to soccer merchandise. Would it be wiser to wait and see if the current interest in the sport is a once-every-four-years flash-in-the-pan frenzy?“Even if there’s a bump in participation [in soccer] and TV ratings, one year does not make a trend,” said Larry Weindruch of the National Sporting Goods Association. “We like to look at five-year progressions, 10-year progressions, so we can look and see what’s going on.”Soccer is the most popular sport in world, but still has not quite caught up to other sports in America. Known as “The Beautiful Game” by many around the world, Americans still gravitate to tackle football, baseball, basketball and even hockey when the World Cup is not on television.But marketing experts are not as cautious as Weindruch. Many think now is the time to keep pushing soccer gear, even with the World Cup concluding Sunday.“We are now at least one generation in of parents who grew up playing soccer as a child,” said Dr. Kirk Wakefield, the executive director of sports and entertainment marketing at Baylor University’s Hankamer School of Business “So, they understand the game and are likely to include their children in the game, particularly compared to the boomers and older generations.”Rick Burton, a sports management professor at Syracuse University and a former marketing officer for the U.S. Olympic Committee, pointed to the recent success of Major League Soccer. America’s professional league is the key to maintaining interest to the point where retailers can continue selling soccer merchandise long after the World Cup concludes, he said.Burton said the growth of Major League Soccer over the past 10 years has played a big part in Americans embracing soccer.Television audiences will be able to see a lot more pro games in the near future.The league reached eight-year agreements in May with ESPN, FOX Sports and Univision Deportes to televise games on a regular basis. The contracts, which the SportsBusiness Journal estimates to be worth a combined $90 million per year — up from the $18 million per year in the current deal which expires at season’s end — means each network will broadcast a minimum of 34 league games per season.But even with the success of a U.S. league, Weindruch said retailers need to continue using their own facts and figures from previous years before declaring the summer’s soccer craze a trend, and putting all of their eggs in one basket.“If their track record is they’re not able to meet the expectations that are set for certain products, you won’t see them increasing floor space [for those products]. If the demand is good, you will see that. That’s something we can’t predict,” Weindruch said.But Modell’s Karlowski still sees soccer merchandise flying off the shelves, even though the U.S. team was eliminated in Brazil on July 1. It’s momentum for the sport that Modell’s hopes to ride into the 2018 World Cup in Russia.More World Cup coverage: Why Brazilian stocks rose after awful World Cup defeatBrazil likely to see car sales fall	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E20E4D92-0846-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

And if it were to have begun, there would be no shortage of reasons: We’re right in the middle of the seasonally unfavorable “sell in May and go away” period, for example, and the Fed has just announced that it would end its bond-buying stimulus program in just three months. And then, earlier today, one of Portugal’s biggest banks announced that it would have to delay a debt repayment—rekindling worries of a European debt crisis that many investors had thought was long since resolved.Just what Europe needed: another banking crisis, writes MarketWatch’s Sara Sjolin over in London.There are striking similarities to daily headlines from the crisis two years ago, when ECB President Mario Draghi was forced to calm panicky bond markets with his famous “do whatever it takes” speech, she adds in her story, which features the adjacent chart.Read Sjolin’s story: Portugal’s banking turmoil revives darkest nightmares about EuropeSteven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at Citi Private Bank, downplayed the concerns about Portugal for U.S. stocks. He said investors are just using downbeat economic and banking news from Europe and Asia as an excuse to sell.“The reality is that we had a 6% rally in just six weeks, and markets were looking for an excuse to correct.

Amazon shelves French book discounts	By Sam SchechnerThe new law, which went into effect Thursday morning, essentially forbids online booksellers from applying government-regulated discounts to the cover prices of books. They can mark down shipping under the new law--often called the “Anti-Amazon” law--but they cannot offer it free.“We’re sadly no longer authorized to offer you a 5% discount on books,” Amazon /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN -0.52%   said in a note on its French website. A paperback copy of novelist Michel Houellebecq’s recent book “Platforme,” for instance, was on sale Thursday for 8.10 euros ($11.03), plus EUR0.01 in shipping in France. Previously, it had cost EUR7.70 with free shipping.The new law is the latest step by European governments--particularly France’s--to rein in what they see as the growing power of a group of largely American tech companies. The French government said last month that it aims to propose new regulations at a European level to ensure a “level playing field” for European companies against U.S. firms.Amazon has been under particular pressure lately. The European Union is looking into its tax arrangements in Luxembourg. In Germany, its unions have been striking over wages. The company is also in the midst of a bitter dispute with Hachette Book Group, part of France’s Lagardère SCA /quotes/zigman/126348/delayed FR:MMB -3.44%  , over e-book pricing, in which its negotiating tactics have included removing preorder buttons on coming Hachette titles.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Yahoo plan for Alibaba cash draws attentionSocial Security loophole’s huge windfall opportunityMurderer turns himself into ‘Oracle of San Quentin’	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A947C5E6-0847-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

It’s set for its ninth session loss in row.“Crude-oil futures have gotten absolutely crushed in recent weeks after spiking to fresh highs of the year thanks to the sudden escalation of violence in Iraq last month,” said Tyler Richey, an analyst for the 7:00’s Report, which offers daily markets commentary. “Since those highs, the selling momentum has been overwhelming.”Nymex crude ended lower on Wednesday for a ninth straight session, marking the longest losing streak since December 2009. Oil was pressured Wednesday by a smaller-than-expected drop in U.S. crude supplies and signs Libyan production is rebounding faster than had been expected.Oil futures trimmed losses somewhat after first-time weekly jobless claims fell more than expected to near a seven-year low.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Thursday forecast global oil demand growth this year at 1.13 million barrels a day, broadly unchanged from a previous monthly report, while demand in 2015 is expected to “increase at faster pace” of 1.21 million barrels a day.But in June 2014, OPEC crude-oil production, based on secondary sources, fell by 79,000 barrels a day to average 29.7 million barrels a day, OPEC said.Natural-gas futures on Thursday fell after the U.S. government supply update. They’re holding ground at a six-month low.August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 -0.60%  traded at $4.16 per million British thermal units on Nymex, down a penny.The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that supplies of natural gas climbed 93 billion cubic feet for the week ended July 4.

Yahoo plan for Alibaba cash draws attention	By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatchWith the IPO drawing near, analysts are asking: What will Yahoo /quotes/zigman/59898/delayed/quotes/nls/yhoo YHOO -0.89%  do with all that Alibaba cash?Analysts expect clues to emerge in next week’s report when Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer is expected to face questions on how Yahoo plans to utilize profits from the coming IPO, at a time of when she’s pushing to turn around the struggling Web portal.“We will be listening closely for how Yahoo thinks about using its Alibaba cash to improve its core business and/or return capital to shareholders,” Susquehanna analyst Brian Nowak told clients in a note. “In our view, Yahoo still needs a story to tell and strategy to build around after Alibaba becomes a fully separate investable entity.”Yahoo shares took a hit last month after Alibaba disclosed weaker revenue growth in the March quarter. That has dampened some of the excitement around Yahoo’s potential gains from the Alibaba IPO, although the company is still expected to make a killing from the transaction.But how Yahoo plans to use its Alibaba cash is still unclear, especially as the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company tries to establish a stronger market position against stronger rivals led by Google Inc. /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG -0.50%  and Facebook Inc. /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB -0.32%  Topeka Capital analyst Victor Anthony said he expects Yahoo to “net fully taxed $9 billion in cash” from the Alibaba IPO.“Capital allocation will be a key focus given the forthcoming cash haul from the Alibaba IPO,” he told clients in a note. “Key on investors’ minds will be how management chooses to allocate that capital between a share-repurchase and an acquisition.”Anthony suggested some would-be Yahoo targets, adding, “A mobile ad network, Vevo, Hulu, and Spotify could potentially help accelerate core growth or expand into a new growth category.”How much of that Alibaba cash Yahoo plans to its investors is also drawing attention. Yahoo shares have rallied nearly 30% over the past 12 months, mainly on strong investor interest in gains from the Alibaba IPO.“The issue of how management intends to use the proceedings of an Alibaba IPO and whether they intend to return all or most of it to shareholders is now becoming increasingly important,” Bernstein Research analyst Carlos Kirjner told clients in a note.“We believe that once Alibaba goes public in the U.S. there will be a discount applied to Yahoo’s stake on Alibaba, to reflect limited liquidity and the risk associated with potential misuse of the proceedings associated with the stake by Yahoo,” he added. “We think that this discount will be minimized if Yahoo! establishes a precedent and returns all or the vast majority of the cash it receives from the IPO.”Other must-read stories from MarketWatch:Social security loophole’s huge windfall opportunityNewmont up as gold rallies	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=65C637AE-0841-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Skipping the obvious when investing in Chile	By Peter KohliBut before going any further, I want to explain why Im not suggesting perhaps the most obvious alternative to Brazil, the Andean Exchange. Seemingly anyone bullish on Chile, Colombia and Peru would consider investing in the stock exchange formed in 2011 by these three countries.There are three simple reasons why Im not now focusing on the Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano (MILA), as its also known. First, it was designed to promote intra-regional trade, and, second, this was done to help diversify the constituent economies away from their historic commodity bases. Third, none of the three ETFs based on the exchange have done particularly well.I prefer to make picks based in specific sectors at this time. I think investors looking for an alternative to Brazil will be better served by country-specific opportunities driven by what I think is a key economic growth factor: a growing middle class; namely consumer goods, finance and infrastructure.In the past decade, the middle class in Latin America grew 50%, according to the World Bank. As millions work their way up the social and income ladder, they spend more on personal goods, require more access to credit and finance, and start to demand better and more reliable infrastructure from their governments.Of course, international companies like Unilever /quotes/zigman/202185/delayed/quotes/nls/un UN -2.08%  and Procter and Gamble /quotes/zigman/238894/delayed/quotes/nls/pg PG -0.22%  are well positioned in Chile to take advantage of the growing demand for consumer goods, but there are some home-grown companies to consider also.Available to United States citizens through ADRs, there is the beverage company Compania Cervecerias Unidas /quotes/zigman/187915/delayed/quotes/nls/ccu CCU -0.82%  . In financial services, there is Banco Santander Chile /quotes/zigman/309427/delayed/quotes/nls/bsac BSAC -0.63% .To tap into the demand for infrastructure, there is electricity company and Enersis /quotes/zigman/132803/delayed/quotes/nls/eni ENI -0.60%  .There is no denying that Chile is mainly a commodity-based economy. The government gets 12% of its revenue from gold and it is the largest exporter of copper in the world.For those bullish on this sector, note that in 1971 Chile nationalized the copper mines. There is little access to Codelco, the company controlling about 20% of the worlds reserves of copper and also the worlds largest copper producer. One way of getting commodity access would be through one of Codelcos major partners, such as London-based Anglo American /quotes/zigman/470624/delayed UK:AAL -1.03% . Meanwhile, Toronto-based Barrick Gold /quotes/zigman/12772/delayed/quotes/nls/abx ABX +1.01%  controls or is a partner in most of the major gold-mining projects in Chile.However, at this point Im looking at these countries through the prism of a growing middle class and making suggestions from that point of view. The health of most commodity sectors, not just Chiles, depends upon global development and specifically the growth of the major consumer, China. So a bet on commodities would have less correlation to the growth of the countrys middle class.For a fund that has significant weighting to both middle class-oriented companies as well as some mining exposure, consider iShares MSCI Capped ETF /quotes/zigman/1510610/delayed/quotes/nls/ech ECH -0.88% . Among its top holdings tied to the health of the middle class are consumer discretionary, Chilean department store Falabella (11.16%) and supermarket chain Cencosud (5.00%). On the commodity side, it holds energy firm Copec (7.89%) and materials firms SQMB (4.30%) and CMPC (3.77%).	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3A43B76B-E63D-48FD-AC1D-B46EDCB24853&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10
The New York area is vulnerable to $250 billion in hurricane-related damages		http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=31203424-C2D4-D575-3524-22D7ADB69079&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10
Portugal’s banking turmoil revives darkest nightmares about Europe	By Sara Sjolin, MarketWatchThursday’s turmoil in Portuguese financial conglomerate Espirito Santo International has sent stock markets tumbling, driven bond yields skyward and re-awoken niggling fears about the robustness of Europe’s banking system.Sound familiar? Well, there are striking similarities to daily headlines from the crisis two years ago, when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was forced to calm panicky bond markets with his famous “do whatever it takes” speech.And as Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, put it in a note on Thursday: “The event has hit European financials like a torpedo and has revived investors’ darkest nightmares about Europe.”If your definition of that nightmare is a selloff, his description is pretty much spot-on. Portuguese government bonds are tanking, sending the benchmark 10-year yield to levels not seen since before the June ECB meeting, when the central bank launched an aggressive package of liquidity measures. The 10-year borrowing costs for government paper were up 21 basis points on Thursday, to 3.97%, according to electronic trading platform Tradeweb. That’s on top of the 13 basis-point rise on Wednesday.At the same time, the PSI 20 /quotes/zigman/3171650/delayed PT:PSI20 -4.18% , Portugal’s benchmark stock index, slumped 4.2% to 6,105.24, its biggest drop since July last year and the lowest closing level since October.Why? All due to troubles at Portuguese multi-industry conglomerate Espírito Santo International SA (ESI), the general consensus says. Earlier this week, ESI missed a payment on some short-term debt. This triggered massive nervousness over the health of Portugal’s financial sector and sent shares of its subsidiaries Espirito Santo Financial Group SA (ESFG) /quotes/zigman/174284/delayed PT:ESF -8.85%  and Banco Espirito Santo AS (BES) /quotes/zigman/176527/delayed PT:BES -17.24%  deep into the red. Trading in both subsidiaries was suspended on Thursday , when their losses amounted to 9% and 17%, respectively.The company structure of the Espirito Santo family of businesses is rather complicated, but in short: ESI owns 49% of ESFG, which owns 25% of BES. Moody’s Investors Service commented on those layers of ownership on Wednesday, when it yanked ESFG’s rating to Caa2 from B2, placing it on review for a further downgrade. The ratings agency said concerns about ESFG’s creditworthiness were “heightened by the lack of transparency around both the Espirito Santo Group’s financial position and the extent of intra-group linkages, including ESFG’s direct and indirect exposure to ESI.”The delayed coupon payments at ESI are, in theory, unlikely to spread to the rest of Portugal’s financial sector. But the incident revives concerns about the exit from bailout programs in Portugal and other stressed euro-zone nations, according to analysts. Portugal came out of its rescue and adjustment program back in May, which “at this stage appears rather premature,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note.And here’s why: One of the key reasons that yields in peripheral euro-zone countries have come down so remarkably since the height of the sovereign-debt crisis is the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions program. Although the program has actually never been used, it promised to help out struggling governments that asked for aid by buying sovereign bonds in the secondary market.The catch — and potentially a reason to be concerned about Portugal — is that the country has to be in a bailout program. No program, no OMT eligibility. So, if a bailout-free country has problems with domestic banks, as with Portugal and Espirito Santo, it’s not entirely clear how these will be resolved, the RBC analysts said.“And while the aforementioned case is likely to be an isolated one, it clearly highlights the problems of early bailout exits whilst the economy, the banking system and the public finances are still in a shaky state,” they said.Effects are, however, being felt elsewhere. At a Greek debt sale on Thursday, demand was hurt by the nervousness , and borrowing costs have also risen in Spain and Italy.Hardest hit shares were southern European banks, with Banco Comercial Português SA /quotes/zigman/176392/delayed PT:BCP -6.00%  down 6% in Lisbon, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SA /quotes/zigman/33313188/delayed IT:BMPS -4.29% off 4.3% in Milan and Banco Popular Español SA /quotes/zigman/18006288/delayed ES:POP -1.95%  2% weaker in Madrid.The Espirito Santo case might be isolated in theory, but this suggests the potential fallout is — in reality — already sending shivers through Europe’s financial sector.Minutes may show Fed uneasy over market’s complacency, but with little will to act7 signs a 10%-plus drop may be coming for stocksU.S. stocks slide on trouble in Portugal	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=ED545640-0825-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Microsoft CEO Nadella unveils plan focused squarely on cloud, mobile	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) - Microsoft [s:msft] Chief Executive Satya Nadella on Thursday unveiled an ambitious vision for the tech giant, stressing the need for the software behemoth to become the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. In an e-mail to Microsoft employees, Nadella, who took over as Microsoft CEO earlier this year, also suggested that he was going beyond his predecessor Steve Ballmers plan to reinvent Microsoft as a devices and services company, saying, While the devices and services description was helpful in starting our transformation, we now need to hone in on our unique strategy. Nadella said part of his plan is for Microsoft to build tools to be more predictive, personal and helpful, and to enable organizations to move from automated business processes to intelligent business processes. Microsoft shares were up a fraction.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=DB2B12FD-BB6C-4B91-B82E-066D489F9631&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Emmys underscore who’s providing the buzz	By Jon Friedman, MarketWatchOnce we looked to the movies to give us thrills and chills, suspense and melodrama. We loved characters that looked and sounded unique. Now, more thoroughly than ever, a new kind of television — cable and, thanks to Netflix /quotes/zigman/87598/delayed/quotes/nls/nflx NFLX -0.23% , beyond — captures the drama that major motion pictures once offered American audiences.Just look at the range of ideas, styles and characters by the shows nominated in the drama category: “Breaking Bad,” “Downton Abbey,” “Game of Thrones,” “House of Cards,” “Mad Men” and “True Detective.” Not one of them comes from CBS /quotes/zigman/393390/delayed/quotes/nls/cbs CBS -3.26% , NBC or ABC /quotes/zigman/245568/delayed/quotes/nls/dis DIS +0.04% , the traditional TV networks.Crucially, Netflix, one of the savviest quasi-tech companies in the nation, has initially turned to the television format, and not the movies, to make its mark in the business of providing original content.With the advent of Netflix and other streaming services, a new breed of television is driving change in popular culture, not the traditional networks and certainly not the movies. By creating the riveting political drama “House of Cards” and the prison society of “Orange Is the New Black,” Netflix has further broadened the variety of plot lines — and devised a new way to distribute its content.Netflix, simply by putting its stamp of approval on TV, has given the medium a special cachet.You could argue that cable television came of age with HBO’s brilliant drama “The Sopranos.” Americans embraced a new kind of “TV show” — unpredictable, unflinching and totally irreverent. As revolutionary as anything TV viewers had ever seen, “The Sopranos” depicted a reality and societal underbelly that most of us could never imagine.That’s why AMC’s “Breaking Bad,” a series about a gravely ill high school chemistry teacher who turns to making and selling meth to provide for his family before his death, broke out. Cable offerings became increasingly bold and quirky. Meanwhile, much of network TV continued to shovel out the same kinds of formulaic stuff. Cable TV made stars out of such journeyman actors as James Gandolfini, Bryan Cranston and Jon Hamm.Cable audiences embraced damaged, complex characters like Gandolfini’s Tony Soprano, Cranston’s Walter White and Hamm’s Don Draper. We were drawn to their eccentricities and wanted to know what made them tick. They certainly offered a deeper meaning of life than, say, the folks on “Mike & Molly.”And whither the motion-picture industry amid this bloodless popular-culture revolution? Sure, movie studios make big money churning out sequels of “The Hunger Games” and the like. But do those kinds of productions leave a lasting mark on audiences the way “Breaking Bad” has done?The Emmy nominations underscore the excitement that the actual awards show offers, too.Take the annual snooze-fest that the Oscars broadcast has become, weighed down by an endless show filled with hackneyed gags, oft-maligned hosts and a string of categories for technical achievement that means little outside of Hollywood itself.Now it’s up to the networks and movies to show that they’re also capable of surprising audiences with new kinds of plots and characters. Are they willing to learn from the examples of cable TV and Netflix?More from MarketWatch:Murderer turned stock-picker is ‘Oracle of San Quentin’Social Security loophole’s huge windfall opportunityHow hackers are infecting shipping scanners	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7C523E8A-0848-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

How hackers are infecting shipping scanners	By Priya Anand, MarketWatchThe botnet — a network of computers infected with malware and controlled as a group without its owners knowing — led to the Lanxiang Vocational School in Jinan, the capital of the country’s coastal province of Shandong, according to cybersecurity company TrapX, which detected the malware and announced the discovery Thursday. That school has for years been speculated to serve as a hub of anti-U.S. hacking and the 2009 infiltration of Google’s Gmail servers to hijack the personal accounts of senior U.S. officials. The school did not immediately return a request for comment.“How do we know it’s not running wild in other places?” says Carl Wright, general manager of North America for TrapX. “This is a serious supply-chain issue. It was only a matter of time before people took advantage of the supply chain to infiltrate our organizations.”San Mateo, Calif.-based TrapX first detected the malware in the scanner software about six months ago while doing security testing for one shipping company, finding that 16 of the initial customer’s 48 scanners from a Chinese manufacturer located near the schoolhouse were infected. In the last six months, the security company reached out to other customers of the scanner manufacturer and realized their scanners had the same malware. TrapX also informed the manufacturer, who denied any knowledge of the malware, Wright says.Using the stolen data, an attacker or nation-state could redirect packages and change data within a company’s system, potentially sabotaging business. Wright said he could not name the shipping companies or manufacturer, or the countries where they are based, for security reasons. The security company also would not say what kind of customer data was stolen.U.S. shipping ports are vulnerable to hacking for criminal or other purposes, and a June report by the U.S. Government and Accountability Office recommended that authorities study their cyber-related risks and craft a game plan against such threats.Cyber tensions are escalating between the U.S. and China. Chinese hackers cracked U.S. computer networks to access files of government employees who applied for top-secret clearances, the New York Times reported Wednesday. And in May, the U.S. indicted five Chinese military officers for allegedly hacking U.S. companies’ computers to steal trade secrets.

About one-third of respondents spent less than 10% of those budgets on security, and 13% of those surveyed spent up to 25%.Over the next two years, 49% of respondents plan to invest more heavily in IT security. Cybercrime costs the global economy more than $400 billion, according to a June report by McAfee and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.“Some of the prices of our goods and services are going to go up,” Wright says. “That’s going to be the tax that we all pay.”More from MarketWatch:What a murderer can teach you about stocksAmerican teens can’t read a pay slipSocial Security loophole’s huge windfall opportunity	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=2B8ADA56-0849-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Germany instructs top U.S. spy to leave	By Anton Trojanovski“The representative of the U.S. intelligence agencies at the Embassy of the United States of America has been instructed to leave Germany,” the government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said in a statement.Seibert said the move came amid ongoing espionage investigations by the German federal prosecutor as well as months of controversy over the activities of U.S. intelligence agencies in Germany.The probes have brought German-U.S. relations to their lowest point since details about U.S. surveillance in Germany--including that of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cellphone--began to emerge last year. But the U.S. has so far offered little public response to the latest controversy, further stoking German frustrations.“It remains essential for Germany to work closely and trustingly with Western partners, especially with the United States, for the safety of its citizens and forces abroad,” Seibert said. “But trust and openness is necessary for this from both sides.”The identity of the person being asked to leave wasn’t immediately clear. In Washington, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden declined to comment on what she called “a purported intelligence matter.”“Our security and intelligence relationship with Germany is a very important one and it keeps Germans and Americans safe,” Hayden said in a statement. “It is essential that cooperation continue in all areas and we will continue to be in touch with the German government in appropriate channels.”The disclosures last year over National Security Agency surveillance in Germany, including the monitoring of Merkel’s cellphone, have stirred anger. That outrage grew over the past week as two cases emerged of German government employees suspected of working for foreign intelligence agencies.In the first case, disclosed last week, a German intelligence employee who had been arrested on suspicion of seeking to spy for Russia told investigators he had been selling secret documents to the U.S. for more than two years, according to people briefed on the matter.In the second case, revealed Wednesday, police searched the home and office of a German defense ministry employee on espionage suspicions, officials said. German media said the U.S. was involved in that case as well, but those reports couldn’t be independently confirmed.Revelations about U.S. spy programs have touched a nerve in Germany, where espionage is a sensitive matter because of government surveillance during the Nazi and Communist regimes in Germany.The espionage cases of the past week also presented a challenge for Merkel, who has tried to quiet demands in the media and from opposition politicians that she take a tougher line against the U.S.In comments Thursday shortly before the government announced it was instructing the U.S. official to leave, Merkel said the U.S. appeared to be wasting its time spying on one of its closest allies.“If the allegations prove to be true...then I simply want to say common sense tells me that spying against allies is a waste of energy,” Merkel said.“We have so many problems and I believe we should focus on the main ones, “ she went on, referring to the crisis in Syria, Sunni militants in Iraq and the broader fight against terrorism.Want to read the latest and most interesting stories and analysis to come out of D.C.?

Tesla looking at Dallas area for gigafactory: report	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Tesla Motors Inc. /quotes/zigman/118681/delayed/quotes/nls/tsla TSLA -1.02% may be looking at land in southern Dallas County for its proposed $5 billion battery plant, according to a report on The Dallas Morning News website. The newspaper quoted a regional transportation official as saying an unidentified site may be placed under consideration for the gigafactory and that transportation improvements will be needed. In addition to Texas, Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico are vying for the plant, which is expected to employ more than 6,000 workers and bring down the cost of batteries enough for Tesla to launch its mass-market electric car. Tesla had said it would make an announcement about the factorys location by the end of June, but has kept mum on the issue after that deadline. Shares of electric car maker fell 0.7% on Thursday, bringing weekly losses to 3.3%.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F6A054EE-22CB-43C2-8B34-A0D044B006BA&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Politically, millennials swing both ways	By Quentin Fottrell, MarketWatchOver half of millennials say they would support a socially liberal, fiscally conservative candidate, according to a new survey of 2,000 people aged 18 to 29 years of age carried out by market researcher YouGov for Reason-Rupe, a joint project between the Reason Foundation, a libertarian research organization and the Arthur N. Rupe Foundation, a nonprofit libertarian organization.Although millennials as a whole have voted for Democratic presidential candidates since 2004, their support for the left has waned in recent years. Just 48% of 18- to 29-year-olds voted for Al Gore in 2000 compared with the 54% who voted for John Kerry in 2004, 66% voted for Barack Obama in 2008, but that declined to 60% voting for him in 2012, according to the Pew Research Center, a non-partisan think-tank. What’s more, just 43% identify as Democratic or Democratic leaning, versus 49% of Americans over 30, the YouGov survey found. However, 34% of millennials call themselves independent, three times the rate of those over 30 years of age.One reason for this is they appear to be growing tired of big government. Some 66% of 18- to 29-year-olds say the government is inefficient and wasteful, up from 42% in 2009, according to the YouGov survey. And 58% of respondents in the survey say they’re convinced government agencies abuse their powers, while only 25% trust government agencies to usually do the right thing.Many millennials -- those born between 1980 and 2000 — came of age during or shortly after the George W. Bush presidency and Republican congressional control that left the country with a ballooned federal budget deficit and national debt as well as two unpopular wars, the report states. “The Republican Party — which rhetorically lays claim to free markets, limited government, and fiscal responsibility — found itself lacking credibility and was left holding the bag when the 2008 financial meltdown hit,” it says. “But a sluggish economy left a third of millennials underemployed or unemployed and a third living at home with their parents.”Also see: Are you paying bills for your adult children?Some older millennials are veering toward the right. Harrison Tonne, 26, an entrepreneur in Shelton, Conn., describes himself as a Christian conservative. “I believe in lower taxes and smaller government,” he says. Bureaucracy forced him to downsize his business, which at the time had eight employees. “I decided I was better off having a one-man show,” he says. He also believes in the right to bear arms. “When I do become a homeowner or family man I am definitely going to buy one or two guns and keep them in a safe place because there are bad people out there,” Tonne adds.Also see: 10 things Generation X won’t tell youOne theory: the slow recovery in jobs may have weighed on their confidence in the current administration, particularly as they appear to be among the hardest hit. Some 47% of 18- to 29-year-olds say they approved of the performance of President Obama, down from 54% a year earlier, according to a recent poll carried out by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics, which tries to get young people involved in careers in politics and public service. Rob Maxim, 25, works for a non-partisan think-tank in Washington and is one of the 47%. He says Obama would have accomplished more if he had a cooperative Congress. “I have a couple of very close friends who are pretty conservative Republicans,” he says. “We only talk about issues where we can make intelligent points rather than shouting about it and making stuff up.”“Millennials are the first generation to have been through the system since it broke, and old enough to vote and have impact,” says Sarah Austin, 28, co-founder and CEO of PeakEnergies.com, an angel investment firm in San Francisco, and a board member of the Shih Yu-Lang YMCA. “There are no manufacturing jobs in the Tenderloin [neighborhood]. There are no assembly plants there, but there are hundreds of programming jobs,” she says. Big government is inefficient, she says, and yet regional governments are too underfunded. Each part of the U.S. needs a government that is more regionalized, she adds.The first voting-age generation to grow up with the Internet, millennials are also less likely to label themselves, studies suggest. Half describe themselves as political independents and about 3-in-10 say they are not affiliated with any religion, a recent report by the Pew Research Center. “These are at or near the highest levels of political and religious disaffiliation recorded for any generation in the quarter-century that the Pew Research Center has been polling on these topics,” the report said. And only 31% say there’s a great deal of difference between the Republican and Democratic parties.The bottom line? Young Americans are not set in their ways, says Bill Connolly, 26, a content creator for a digital advertising agency in New York and a registered Republican. “Being on the younger side, we tend to slant more liberal, but I have a lot of friends who are conservative as well,” he says. He favors putting more power in the hands of local government and a strong federal government, but skews to the left on social issues. “I like the idea of health care for the populace, but I’m not sure with Obamacare that it’s executed in the best way,” he says. Plus, he supports same-sex marriage: “The conservative position on gay marriage is on the wrong side of history.”For those who do want his vote in 2016, Connolly adds, “I’ve voted both ways in elections and I could again.”Other articles by Quentin Fottrell:40% of millennials are unemployedWhy the Class of 2018 will be better offThe kids aren’t buying homes	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=FB32D3D6-0852-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

U.S. stocks trim losses late in session	By Anora Mahmudova and Barbara Kollmeyer, MarketWatchInvestor worries centered on Espirito Santo Financila Group SA. Better-than-expected U.S. jobless claims did little to counter that. The number of people who applied for unemployment benefits in the first week of July fell to a seven-year low.

He said investors are just using downbeat economic and banking news from Europe and Asia as an excuse to sell.“The reality is that we had a 6% rally in just six weeks, and markets were looking for an excuse to correct. Nothing has changed fundamentally, neither in the U.S., nor in Europe,” Wieting said. “Rising markets tend to ignore single data points, but in falling markets, fear gets amplified that someone else will sell.”Meanwhile, the U.S. economic data continued to point toward improvement.The number of people who applied for unemployment benefits in the first week of July fell more sharply than expected to the lowest level since mid-2007.Still to come is the first major speech from Stanley Fischer as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.

Treasurys cut gains as Portugal woes fade	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe 10-year note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR -0.82%  yield, which moves inversely to price, was down half a basis point on the day at 2.538%, but dropped as low as 2.494% in morning trade, a six-week low on a closing basis.The risk-off trade was spurred in large part by concerns over Portuguese banks as Espírito Santo International SA delayed repayment of some of its short-term debt this week.

The minutes, released on Wednesday, pushed Treasury prices higher as investors took from it a continued commitment to low rates.“My view is that the Fed will stay very dovish until they have to turn hawkish,” said Kris Kowal, managing director and chief investment officer at DuPont Capital Management.

Are gold miners preparing to fly high?	By Mike PaulenoffIf accurate, this analysis points toward upside continuation that tests the March rally peak at 28.03. If the March high is hurdled and sustained, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF /quotes/zigman/420125/delayed/quotes/nls/gdx GDX -0.29%  should accelerate towards 31.30-32.20 thereafter.Judging from the juxtaposition of my intermediate-term momentum oscillators with the buoyant price action and a confluence of up-turned exponential moving averages, the gold miners just might be about to fly high across everyones radar screen.Another indication of the GDXs bullish potential is the relative-strength chart with the SPDR S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/714403/delayed/quotes/nls/spy SPY -0.47% . Charting the ratio of the SPY price over the price of the GDX, we see a double-top formation that is trending lower, warning us to expect the SPY to continue to underperform the gold-mining ETF.In fact, since we first noted this double-top to our members on June 16, the GDX has climbed 11.7%, while the SPY has appreciated only 1.4%.Judging from the magnitude of the huge double-top and the angle of descent, the outperformance of the GDX and/or the underperformance of the SPY should continue — and likely accelerate — in the days and weeks ahead.See charts illustrating the technical pattern of the GDX and SPY/GDX ratio.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A7E0C85F-1070-43E4-8ECE-2E07C04D6D14&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10
Bull rolls on, but opportunities start to dwindle	By Kevin MarderFor a larger chart, please click here .Chart created using TradeStation . ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2014. All rights reserved.While the Nasdaqs pullback is considered ordinary, it could extend much farther than its present 2.5% decline from top to bottom and still be considered normal. The reason is because a bull market becomes less unidirectional as it matures. Retracement, or pullback, legs by the averages become larger relative to the impulse, or advancing, legs. (The impulse waves are still longer than the retracement waves, but they begin to catch up in size.)Fewer stocks tend to participate in each new high made by the averages. While this has yet to transpire in New York Stock Exchange-listed names, it has already begun in Nasdaq shares, as shown in the chart below.For a larger chart, please click here .Chart created using TradeStation . ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2014. All rights reserved.The result is that a mature bull market often sees the averages make new highs in grudging fashion, unlike its earlier phase. It is more back-and-forth with an upward bias than it is the big impulse waves of 2013 interrupted by shallower retracement waves.The overarching point is for speculators to temper their expectations of what this mature bull can accomplish. To expect the pullbacks to be minimal and few as they were in 2013, and the advances to be straight and smooth may be unrealistic.This years market is a year older than last years. While a speculator following a technically based strategy such as this one ignores valuation, the market is richer today in an absolute sense than it was last year.Most long-term leading indicators such as breadth and interest-rate proxies are not signaling that the end of the bull is nigh. However, these bear watching, especially the latter, some of which diverge from the blue-chip averages.One subtle hint that should tip off a speculator that the appreciation potential of the current market is not what it was in 2013 is leadership.Looking at the top-performing 30 leaders by one measure, most are value/cyclical, not growth. In fact, the only non-energy growth names in the top 30 are iKang Healthcare Group /quotes/zigman/30132995/delayed/quotes/nls/kang KANG -1.36% , Gilead Sciences /quotes/zigman/72849/delayed/quotes/nls/gild GILD -0.01% , Chipotle Mexican Grill /quotes/zigman/395806/delayed/quotes/nls/cmg CMG -0.65% , Celgene /quotes/zigman/69584/delayed/quotes/nls/celg CELG +0.45% and Under Armour /quotes/zigman/388552/delayed/quotes/nls/ua UA -2.86% . Everything else is value/cyclical.It is not that this rally is devoid of growth, but the leading titles that hold up better are overwhelmingly cyclical. (Oil and gas explorers deserve an asterisk, as they are cyclical numbers in growth clothing. Growth cyclicals. It remains to be seen how their earnings growth fares in a recession when the price of crude is depressed.)Going in a totally different direction, a question came in from a reader, Mr. T: First of all I love following you and the insight I get is priceless. However I somehow lost track of one important point. Which stocks are the current glamours? It would be very helpful to have some insight on your manual screening process with regards to institutional glamours, speculative glamours .	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=28A9DB67-7B05-4F38-9FE7-5CAAC6C51A99&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Dollar, yen up against euro on Espirito Santo woes	By Joseph Adinolfi, MarketWatchThe ICE dollar index /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY +0.12% , which measures the greenback against a basket of six rivals, rose to 80.152 from 80.032 on Wednesday.The yen has also benefited from Europe’s woes, with the euro trading at /quotes/zigman/4868097/realtime/sampled EURJPY -0.5696% ¥137.700 Thursday, down from ¥138.000 on Wednesday.The euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/realtime/sampled EURUSD -0.2419%  was trading at $1.360, compared with $1.364 Wednesday.Alan Ruskin, currency strategist at Deutsche Bank, expects the dollar’s buoyant turn to be short-lived.“What you’re seeing is a risk aversion sort of trade, the dollar has done well but the euro has lost ground,” Ruskin said.French industrial production dropped unexpectedly in May. A rebound in energy production was offset by the largest decline in manufacturing output in over 18 months. Italy’s industrial production also unexpectedly fell in May.The weak European data was secondary in its ability to drive the dollar upward, Ruskin said, attributing the move primarily to the news out of Portugal.5 things to know about Banco Espirito Santo and EuropeEnvironmental groups oppose trans-Atlantic trade dealPortuguese government yields soar amid banking turmoil	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=BC6B3AB6-085D-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Oil rebounds to end losing streak at 9 sessions	By Myra P. Saefong, MarketWatch , Angela JohnsonFor most of the trading session, prices had been poised to log a 10th straight session decline, pressured by expectations of increased crude supply from Libya, a lack of production disruptions in Iraq and worries about European energy demand.Meanwhile, natural-gas futures held ground at their lowest level since January following data showing a weekly climb in U.S. supplies of the fuel.Crude for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 +0.57%  rose 64 cents, or 0.6%, to settle at $102.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Over the previous nine trading sessions, prices lost more than $4 a barrel.August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 +0.39% rose 39 cents, or 0.4%, to end at 108.67 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange after eight sessions of losses in a row.Sellers of Nymex crude “simply became exhausted and began to book profits, which has resulted in a short squeeze,” said Tyler Richey, an analyst for the 7:00’s Report, which offers daily markets commentary. “It will be important to see if futures can break the sharp downtrend that has developed on the daily chart since the selloff began late last month. That level is approximately $103 a barrel.”Nymex crude ended lower on Wednesday for a ninth straight session, marking the longest losing streak since December 2009. Oil was pressured Wednesday by a smaller-than-expected drop in U.S. crude supplies and signs that Libyan production is rebounding faster than had been expected.Oil futures had trimmed of some their early Thursday losses after first-time weekly jobless claims fell more than expected to near a seven-year low.But “the market is well overbought here and has been,” said Donovan Lazar, New York general manager at the Online Trading Academy. “The possibility of a much worse European bank crisis looms, coupled with a completely illusionary jobs report” last week that showed growth in the U.S. jobs market though numbers are “completely skewed due to the lack of job seekers at this point.”Downbeat news on the economy tends to dull the outlook for energy demand. However, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Thursday forecast global oil demand growth this year at 1.13 million barrels a day, broadly unchanged from a previous monthly report, while demand in 2015 is expected to “increase at faster pace” of 1.21 million barrels a day.Natural-gas futures on Thursday fell after the U.S. government supply update. They remain at a six-month low.August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 -1.22%  settled at $4.12 per million British thermal units on Nymex, down 5 cents, or 1.2%.The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that supplies of natural gas climbed 93 billion cubic feet for the week ended July 4. Analysts surveyed by Platts forecast an increase of between 90 billion cubic feet and 94 billion cubic feet.Rounding out action on Nymex, prices for petroleum futures finished higher. August gasoline /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 +0.73%  rose 2 cents to $2.96 a gallon, while August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821453/delayed HOQ4 -0.35% also tacked on 2 cents to $2.89 a gallon.Environmental groups oppose trans-Atlantic trade dealEnding unemployment benefits didn’t cut jobless rate7 signs stocks are headed for a 10%-plus drop	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=790D778A-082F-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Fed’s Fischer against breaking up big banks	By Greg Robb, MarketWatchIn a speech to the National Bureau of Economic Research, Fischer said it is not clear that breaking up the largest banks would end the need for government bailouts of the financial sector.“In short, actively breaking up the largest banks would be a very complex task, with uncertain payoff,” Fischer said in his first public remarks since joining the central bank in May.Fischer, the former vice chairman of Citigroup, will find some opposition to this view on the Fed as Richard Fisher, the president of the Dallas Fed, is a strong proponent of breaking up banks to end too-big-to-fail.While much progress has been made, the problem of too-big-to-fail banks persists, Fischer said.“We should never allow ourselves the complacency to believe that we have put an end to too-big-to-fail,” he said.In his speech, Fischer also said he wanted to examine ways to strengthen the powers of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The FSOC, set up by the Dodd-Frank bank reform law, is a group of financial regulators who meet to share information and coordinate actions.In contrast to the U.K. regulatory system, the FSOC does not have the legal power to impose policy changes on regulators.Fischer backed a suggestion from former Fed Vice Chairman Don Kohn that all U.S. regulatory agencies that are part of FSOC should make financial stability a part of their official mandate.“It will be important to ensure that coordination among different regulators of the financial system is effective and, in particular, will be effective in the event of a crisis,” he said.Fischer also called for more research to make regulatory “macroprudential” tools more effective if central banks want to use them instead of higher interest rates to try to deal with asset-price increases. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen has backed using macroprudential tools, though she also acknowledged the limited research on their effectiveness.Policy makers need to be cautious using these tools given the limited experience.Efforts to curb any potential housing bubble should focus on the supply side, Fischer said, noting his experience at the Bank of Israel.“Measures aimed at reducing the demand for housing are likely to be politically sensitive,” he said.More news on MarketWatch:Murderer tuned stock picker is ‘Oracle of San Quentin’U.S. stocks end lower; Europe worries resurface	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=2DBF3494-086B-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Citigroup earnings: Trading revenue, legal issues in focus	By Sital S. Patel, MarketWatchEarnings: The nation’s fourth-largest bank by assets is expected to report net income of $3.35 billion, or $1.08 earnings per share, down from $4.18 billion, or $1.25 a share in the year-earlier period, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.Revenue: The bank is expected to report a decline in revenue. The consensus estimate is for $18.92 billion for the quarter, compared to $20.48 billion a year ago.Stock reaction: Shares are trading at $46.90, down 10% year-to-date and 15% below their 52-week high. Shares have lagged the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund /quotes/zigman/246222/delayed/quotes/nls/xlf XLF -0.66% , which tracks financial stocks in the S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX -0.41%  and is up 3.6% year-to-date. Analysts have an average price target on the stock of $57.54, according to FactSet.Key issues: Citigroup CFO John Gerspach warned in May that the slump in trading revenue reported in the first-quarter could be even sharper in the second quarter. Like its peers, Citigroup was hurt by a slump in fixed-income trading, which was down 18% in the first quarter. That could widen to a decline of between 20% and 25% in the second quarter, said Gerspach.Legal issues: Citigroup may settle a civil lawsuit with the Justice Department for $7 billion as early as next week, according to reports. The settlement relates to allegations the bank sold shoddy mortgages to investors leading up to the financial crisis. The figure is smaller than the $12 billion that J.P. Morgan paid for similar charges, but higher than the $4 billion that Citigroup originally expected to pay. Investors should watch for comments on legal expenses and for any news on the fraud case at its Mexican unit, Banamex. Citi is also still embroiled in a probe of foreign exchange fixing that could bring further fines.Other troubles: The Federal Reserve rejected a proposed $6.4 billion share buyback plan earlier this year, after failing the bank on its annual stress test on “qualitative” grounds. Citi was recently granted a six month extension to resubmit capital plans, moving the date forward to January. Investors should look for comments from executives on any progress the bank has made on managing that process. The bank is not allowed to raise its dividend until a new capital plan has been approved.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8D4DFD36-0867-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10
Treasurys rise for fourth day on Portugal banking woes	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe 10-year note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR -0.66%  yield, which moves inversely to price, was down a basis point on the day at 2.536%, but dropped as low as 2.494% in morning trade, a six-week low on a closing basis. The four-day drop in yields was the biggest since the end of May.The risk-off trade was spurred in large part by concerns over Portuguese banks, as Espírito Santo International SA delayed repayment of some of its short-term debt this week. Espírito Santo Financial Group SA /quotes/zigman/174284/delayed PT:ESF -8.85%  and Banco Espírito Santo /quotes/zigman/176527/delayed PT:BES -17.24% , both under the umbrella of ESI, had trading of their shares suspended.Investors fled risk assets, leading U.S. markets to open sharply lower, though they recovered some losses throughout the day.Portuguese 10-year bond yields surged for a second day, rising 21 basis points to 4.013%, according to Tradeweb.

The minutes, released on Wednesday, pushed Treasury prices higher as investors took from it a continued commitment to low rates.“My view is that the Fed will stay very dovish until they have to turn hawkish,” said Kris Kowal, managing director and chief investment officer at DuPont Capital Management. He noted that the Fed may be forced to consider more hawkish policies if inflation and economic growth pick up.Demand for Treasurys was aided by weak Chinese export data.

Gap falls after June sales unexpectedly decline	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Gap Inc. /quotes/zigman/227242/delayed/quotes/nls/gps GPS -1.09% shares fell 3% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the parent company of Old Navy and Banana Republic reported a 2% drop in same store sales in June. That missed the 0.7% average gain of analysts surveyed by Retail Metrics. While Old Navys 7% gain topped the 1.1% gain analysts were looking for, both Banana Republic and Gap chains saw a surprise 7% drop each. Gaps miss was notable especially after most retailers that reported June sales saw a positive surprise and delivered better-than-expected June sales for a fourth straight month, according to Retail Metrics.

And then, earlier today, one of Portugal’s biggest banks announced that it would have to delay a debt repayment—rekindling worries of a European debt crisis that many investors had thought was long since resolved.Quick market update: stocks have trimmed opening losses.S&P 500 .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX  -0.49%Dow   .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA  -0.54%Nasdaq .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP  -0.6% This is a classic example of pure irrational exuberance.CYNK is now bigger than… http://t.co/X3yWbnMpp7 pic.twitter.com/anyiT0YBGH— zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 10, 2014 Via Ben Eisen: Treasurys gain for 4th day on Portugal banking woesTreasury prices climbed Thursday, putting benchmark yields on track to drop for a fourth consecutive session as investors bought into the safety of U.S. government debt amid fears about Portugal’s banking system.Technology stocks were mostly lower Thursday as the group joined a broad market retreat on new worries about the European economy, writes Benjamin Pimentel.Apple .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed /quotes/nls/aapl AAPL  -0.9%Yahoo .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/59898/delayed /quotes/nls/yhoo YHOO  -0.9%Analysts at FBR were upbeat on Microsoft’s outlook for fiscal 2015 after getting a glimpse of CEO Satya Nadella’s email to employees in which he outlined the company’s strategy going forward. We believe the key takeaway from the email was Mr. Nadella’s reiteration of the company’s commitment toward its cloud/mobile focus, which we think will ultimately help reignite optimism out of the gates for FY15.The analysts maintained their outperform rating on the stock.

Fund and money managers have stayed in the market, with the joke being that they are too scared to be out of it, and new money has not significantly come in, even as markets have set new highs. It is going to take an event to get either of these two to change their course – but at this point Portugal does not appear to do it for fund managers. Earnings season starts tomorrow with the banks (Wells Fargo), with Monday being C, Tuesday JPM, GS, JNJ, and YHOO and INTC after the close. If we do better than the current high expectations call for, we could move over the 2K and back over 17K level and stay there, at least for through earnings season, however, if they disappoint, we could get that correction we keep talking (and talking, and talking) about. Oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rebounded on Thursday to log their first gain in 10 trading sessions.“Sellers simply became exhausted and began to book profits,” said Tyler Richey, an analyst for the 7:00’s Report.August crude .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 tacked on 64 cents, or 0.6%, to settle at $102.93 a barrel. If one stock captures the bubbliness of this market, it’s this one, writes Shawn LangloisIt’s “Throwback Thursday”, starring Cynk Technology CYNK .As of Wednesday’s close, the stock had rallied almost 25,000% over the past few weeks, pushing its nosebleed valuation toward $5 billion and sending traders (and markets reporters) on an Internet goose chase to figure out what it’s all about.They discovered, well, almost nothing.

Murderer turned stock picker is ‘Oracle of San Quentin’	By Catey Hill, MarketWatchAmong the inmates in California’s sprawling San Quentin State Prison, Carroll’s violent past is ordinary — but his present is anything but. In a place where physical toughness is the main way to earn respect, Carroll has built a following among his fellow prisoners by teaching them how to stay out of debt, draw up a budget — and pick stocks.His friends call him “Wall Street.” In prison, that’s a compliment.“From what I hear, I’m one of a kind,” he tells me when I meet him for an interview. A fast-talking man with a swagger befitting an A-list celebrity, Carroll greets me with an assured nod from behind black aviator sunglasses. Trim, short and clean-cut, he looks a decade younger than his years. “There is not a lot of people who’ve been doing what I’ve been doing, created what I’ve created,” he says.That’s certainly true. At a time when financial literacy is barely taught even outside of prison, the classes Carroll conducts for fellow inmates represent an unusual effort to reach an undereducated population. (See also: What prison inmates learn about money.)It’s an outcome that’s all the more unlikely because Carroll, by his own account, was illiterate when he got to prison. Now, he says, he reads the Wall Street Journal every day. He invokes Warren Buffett in conversation as one of his idols — and in homage to Buffett, one prison official calls Carroll “the Oracle of San Quentin.”Carroll’s interest in investing goes back more than a decade, but his influence has grown since 2012, when he was transferred to this prison, a huge facility that hosts one of the country’s biggest prison education programs. Here, his experience and confidence have helped him turn dozens of people into “clients” who take his advice — including noninmates who volunteer at the prison.“Everything he says is stuff you hear” from other financial talking heads, says Tom De Martini, an insurance agent who took classes from Carroll while volunteering. “But … to be doing it behind prison walls, it’s so impressive.” Another volunteer, photography professor Nigel Poor, says she invested in stocks for the first time after hearing Carroll. “I am 50; I wish someone had taught me this when I was 20,” Poor says. Fellow inmate Troy Williams says that most books about investing are “geared towards people with money,” but Carroll “has strategies for everyday, common people.”Carroll says his lessons are designed to help his fellow inmates avoid hopelessness and crime. They’re also bucking a national trend: A Rand Corp. study published last year found that budget cuts were depressing the number of courses and students in many prison programs.But Carroll is quick to add that his interests aren’t simply academic, or altruistic. “I go where the money goes — it’s always been that way,” he says. And the money for him, these days, is in stocks.Or at least, it’s there in theory. It isn’t possible to independently assess Carroll’s track record: While he says he has brokerage accounts of his own, records that he shared with MarketWatch weren’t complete enough to gauge how well his investments have performed. As for his advice, it’s a mixed bag — some quite good, some risky and speculative, and most of it brand-new territory for a clientele that lives behind prison walls.***Carroll says his family never had much money — they lived on welfare and bounced around from the streets to homeless shelters to churches to apartments in and around Oakland, Calif. He vividly remembers the day his mother got a windfall and bought him and his brother new bikes — and the day, not long after, when a local drug dealer took the bikes as repayment for his mom’s debts.But Carroll befriended the dealer’s son — and eventually made friends with the dealer, too. He recalls wishing for a new pair of “red, bright-colored shoes” from LA Gear. While his mom couldn’t afford those coveted shoes, the drug dealer could.“He took me to the mall and bought me some,” Carroll says. “That is really when I started to, like, see the money as the means to everything — people with the money got the power.”It didn’t take Carroll long to find a way to make money of his own. At a bowling alley where his mother worked as a waitress, an older man taught Carroll a grift: Curtis would play arcade games, distracting the alley owners while the man broke into the back of the machine and stole quarters. Soon, Carroll learned how to do the break-ins himself. “That became a part of my main source of income,” he says.His newfound wealth was like a high to him, Carroll says: At some points, he’d have as much as $5,000, which he’d hide in a pillowcase buried in leaves in the woods, or in the wall at home behind his martial-arts plaque. At high school, “I used to take $5 bills and $1 bills and throw them into the crowd, just to see [people] go crazy.”But as he got older, Carroll’s criminality caught up to him. His arcade-game robberies landed him in juvenile hall, he says. And in 1996, when he was 17, he and two friends were involved in the fatal shooting of a young man named Gilberto Medina Gil, in what police said was a botched robbery attempt. Carroll was accused of being the shooter; three years later, a jury convicted him of murder.According to court records, a witness told police that Carroll told him, “I never thought I could pull a trigger like that.” Today, he says that his crime was “heinous”; he also says that he tried to send money to the victim’s family, something MarketWatch couldnt independently confirm.***In one sense, the conversion from Curtis Carroll to “Wall Street” began before the jury found him guilty. Carroll, who used to pay other kids to do his homework for him, says he couldn’t read the court papers his lawyer put in front of him. “I don’t know if my lawyer ever knew” about his illiteracy, he says. Carroll is quick to add that illiteracy doesn’t excuse his crime. Still, he says, “Being illiterate is like being in a bubble. Being uneducated affects the way people move in life, it affects what they become in life.”It took a while for that lesson to sink in. When he first got to prison, he was assigned a female reading tutor, and he had far more interest in her looks than her brains. “I wouldn’t mind going out there to look at a woman — I’m in jail,” he says. “I’m thinking I’m going to use the pages [as rolling papers] to smoke weed or something.”Carroll says it wasn’t until he accidentally grabbed the business section of a newspaper — he was trying to get the sports section so that his cell mate could read it to him — that he had a light-bulb moment about reading. “An older [inmate] asked me if I played the stock market. I said ‘What’s that?’ And he says, ‘It’s a place where white people keep their money.’ ”“The first thing I thought was, this has got to be where it’s at,” he says. “If I can read, I can find out about this business stuff. … Money is gonna be gotten somehow.”***By the time Carroll had his epiphany, of course, the Internet was upending the way investors tracked the markets. For most inmates, access to the Internet is a rare privilege. So Carroll has taught himself the way someone might have done in the 1950s — by poring over stock quotes in newspaper financial sections. When we meet, he shows me stacks of binders filled with hundreds of pages of stock prices he’s copied over the years.Our interview took place in a shared library and classroom used by San Quentin’s education program, a room cluttered with books and mismatched office furniture. One wall is plastered with a list of stocks Carroll has picked, next to their prices at the time that he selected them. Carroll posted them on the wall, he tells me, to convince the prison’s public information officer, Lt. Samuel Robinson, that his stock picking “wasn’t just a bunch of shenanigans” aimed at defrauding fellow inmates. “In prison, you run across a lot of people who will con you, with visions of grandeur,” Robinson says. But he adds that once he got to know “Wall Street,” he came to trust him. “You’re not sitting down with a dummy,” he adds. “This guy is sharp.”Since Carroll learned reading and investing simultaneously, it isn’t coincidental that, for him, stocks are about stories and emotions. When he’s thinking about investing in a stock, he says, he explains the basics of the company to other inmates, and gauges their reactions. “Psychology runs 70% of the markets,” he says. “Investors play follow-the-leader — if they didn’t, we wouldn’t have the 1%.”Quoting Buffett — “Be greedy when others are fearful, and be fearful when others are greedy” — Carroll argues that the best opportunities to profit come when “people panic about stupid stuff.” His hypothetical example: Bill Gates dies in a plane crash and investors sell Microsoft stock, even though Bill Gates hasn’t been directly involved in the company’s operations in years. For Carroll, of course, that would be an opportunity.The picks on the wall include Zynga /quotes/zigman/7720406/delayed/quotes/nls/znga ZNGA +3.65% , Bank of America /quotes/zigman/190927/delayed/quotes/nls/bac BAC -1.03%  and Facebook /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB -0.15% , which Carroll says he bought in December 2012. What the three stocks had in common at the time: Each was getting substantial bad press — most notably Facebook, thanks to investor malaise after its disappointingly muddled IPO. Those stocks are up 20%, 47% and 134%, respectively, since December 14, 2012; over that same stretch the S&P 500 is up 39%.Carroll also stresses the importance of reading beyond financial publications. His magazine list includes some highly unlikely fare for a men’s prison, including Teen Vogue (great for insight into things that teens adopt first, like social media); PopStar! (to keep up with the entertainment industry) and Shape (for fitness innovations and products).Stock picking is now, Carroll says, at the level of obsession: “ ‘Fun’ is, like, an understatement; it’s life.”***For most inmates, though, stock picking isn’t life, or at least not real life.Carl Takei, a staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, says that it is generally legal for an incarcerated criminal to have assets outside of prison (though the state could seize assets as part of his sentence or in a separate proceeding). But he notes that most inmates aren’t earning money (at least not legally) to invest: If they’re investing at all, they’re most likely tapping into family funds or assets they had before they went to prison. And most have little or nothing to work with. Nearly 60% of the prison population reports a pre-arrest personal income of less than $1,000 a month (and 84% less than $2,000 a month), according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics; and nearly one in three reports being unemployed before going to prison.Communication with banks and brokers can be difficult from behind bars, so inmates who do invest typically have someone on the outside make the investments for them, says Takei. (That’s what Carroll says he does; an outside contact through whom he says he invests didnt return calls requesting an interview.)Plastered to the wall of our meeting room is a sheet of what he calls “the timeless rules of personal finance,” which are:These eat-your-vegetables rules don’t seem to excite “Wall Street” as much as picking stocks does (one more way his experience mirrors the real Wall Street). But he says they’re a big component of the classes he teaches. Many prisoners spend any money they do have while behind bars, he says — mostly on unnecessary items like tobacco — and have nothing left over. Carroll has fellow inmates track their spending so they can see what’s coming in and going out. “I want them to have discipline when they get on the streets,” he says.When he pivots from these financial-literacy basics to his ideas about playing the market, though, Carroll can wind up on shaky ground. Carroll is a fan of penny stocks, for example. He says he likes them because someone like an inmate, who doesn’t have a lot of money, can afford to buy several shares. But he doesn’t address the fact that these companies’ shares are often cheap because they’re financially shaky, and that investors in penny stocks are particularly vulnerable to fraud.Carroll says he recommends specific stocks to inmates, and he uses a relatively simple questionnaire about basic financial statistics to help his students screen stocks. But he’s smoothly evasive when I ask him about which specific stocks he likes right now, changing the subject to broader topics.The bigger issue, in the eyes of most investing pros, is whether inexperienced investors with modest means should be buying individual stocks at all. If you have only a small pot of savings, betting a large share of it on just a few stocks exposes you to more risk (violating Carroll’s own Rule No. 4, about diversification). Alex McAdams, personal-finance analyst for the consumer financial site NerdWallet, is one of many advisers who advocate index funds for lower-income investors. “Is it possible that you could have an insight [about a stock] that the rest of the market doesn’t recognize?” she asks. “Absolutely. Is it likely? Statistically, no.”***It’s telling, and maybe encouraging, that outsiders seem to take away different lessons from Carroll’s teaching than inmates do. Nigel Poor, the photography professor who is working on a project to help tell prisoner’s stories, said she was initially put off by Carroll’s obsession with money. But she found Wall Street’s classes “eye-opening” — and says that afterward she “realized I hadn’t really thought about my [financial] future.”Thanks to Carroll’s class, Poor says, she bought her first stock last year: Hewlett-Packard /quotes/zigman/229301/delayed/quotes/nls/hpq HPQ +0.59% , which has risen from about $23 per share when she bought it, to about $33 per share today (a return that beats the broader market). De Martini, the insurance agent, says that hearing Carroll talk about Twitter /quotes/zigman/23556538/delayed/quotes/nls/twtr TWTR -0.58%  last September inspired him to buy it at its November IPO; he later “got out and made some profit on that.” (Twitter fell below its initial share price this April and has remained below it since then.) De Martini says he also made some money on American Apparel /quotes/zigman/1511249/delayed/quotes/nls/app APP +21.25%  after hearing details about it in the class, but he cautions that in his opinion a lot of Carroll’s advice is “highly speculative” and risky.For fellow inmate — many of whom didn’t graduate high school and haven’t had a “real” job in their lives — the message may be a simpler one, of empowerment. Troy Williams, who’s in prison for robbery, says he plans to apply what’s he’s learned in prison about budgeting and saving to his everyday life when he gets out. And Williams, like others, expresses admiration for Carroll’s chops as a teacher. “In most classes people drop out, but in his class everyone kept coming every week,” De Martini says. “They’re engaged.”Carroll says he hopes that the engagement pays off — that inmates who might otherwise turn or return to crime upon their release can instead try to get their money in legitimate ways. “It’s another way to give them hope,” he says.Will the Oracle of San Quentin get a chance to practice what he preaches? It’s hard to say. If he serves his full sentence, he’s not eligible for release until 2053. But in a recent email, Robinson, the prison official, told MarketWatch that because Carroll committed his crime as a juvenile, he could get a parole review as soon as the year 2020.The Oracle’s response, filtered through Robinson: “He is excited about that.”Also on MarketWatch:Confessions of an insider traderMadoff: ‘Don’t let Wall Street scam you like I did’American teens can’t read a pay slip	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B2300290-07AC-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

Attacking style to emerge as World Cup 2014’s legacy	By Matthew FuttermanThe next day, giant-killer Costa Rica swarmed a defensive Uruguayan team with three second-half goals, punishing the 2010 semifinalists for their passivity. Two days later, U.S. captain Clint Dempsey scored just 29 seconds into the game, his ears still buzzing with the parting words of coach Jürgen Klinsmann just before kickoff: “Attack!”This week brought the ultimate onslaught — Germany’s merciless, 7-1 thrashing of host Brazil, which brought the whole concept of the “attack” to an entirely new level.After years of timid, low-scoring play, that one word has become the theme of Brazil’s World Cup. When the history of this tournament is written, the sport’s cognoscenti will likely point to it as an event that changed the game. The finalists, Germany and Argentina, have survived the most offense-oriented tournament of the modern era, a series of games where playing defensively almost guaranteed an early exit.“There is no clear defensive strategy anymore,” said France coach Didier Deschamps, whose, young, lightning-fast team romped through its group, scoring eight goals in its first two games. “I remember a few years ago, there were some very boring World Cup matches. Not this year. Now it’s end-to-end soccer, it goes from one box to the other, and it’s really entertaining,” he said.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B8D27AAC-0882-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10
Chevron 2nd quarter production expected to ease	By Tess StynesThe second-largest U.S. oil company in market value after Exxon Mobil Corp. /quotes/zigman/203975/delayed/quotes/nls/xom XOM -0.95%   forecast second-quarter earnings would be above its first-quarter profit thanks to asset-sale gains in the latest period, and a comparison with the previous quarter which included write-downs.The company produced 2.6 million barrels of oil and natural gas in April and May, down 0.6% from the year-earlier period.Throughout the oil giant’s interim report, Chevron compared the first two months of the second quarter with the entire quarter of the year-earlier period and all of the first quarter of 2014.Chevron’s U.S. production in the first two months of the quarter reached about 665,000 barrels of oil and natural gas a day, an increase of 0.9% from the year-earlier quarter and a 3.9% increase from the first quarter, mostly because of less maintenance activity in the Gulf of Mexico and increased production in the Permian Basin.International production reached 1.9 million barrels a day, down 1.1% year-to-year and falling 2.4% from the first quarter, on planned turnaround activity in Kazakhstan, in addition to the shutdown of the LNG facility in Angola.Average realized U.S. oil prices edged down 0.3% to $92.01 a barrel in the first two months of the quarter from the year-earlier quarter, while international prices rose 7.1% to $100.35.Average realized domestic natural-gas prices increased by 8.7% to $4.11 per thousand cubic feet in the first two months of the quarter from the year-earlier quarter.

Boehner to sue over Obamacare delay of employer mandate	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- House Speaker John Boehner said Thursday he will sue President Barack Obama over implementation of the Affordable Care Act, specifically the employer mandate the White House delayed. In 2013, the president changed the health care law without a vote of Congress, effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it. Thats not the way our system of government was designed to work. No president should have the power to make laws on his or her own, Boehner said in a statement . Boehner had previously said he would sue Obama over executive actions but had not previously stated why.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=355CB8FF-2F7A-4179-BFDF-55DA2D58EF80&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-10

China to offer electric-car tax break; Tesla may benefit	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Chinas central government said Wednesday it planned to exempt electric and fuel-cell cars sold in mainland China from sales tax, starting Sept. 1 and running until the end of 2017, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. The tax benefit would cover electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids (including extended-range electric vehicles ) and fuel-cell vehicles.

U.S. stocks: Futures rebound ahead of Wells Fargo results	By Carla Mozee, MarketWatchInvestors also will monitor appearances by three Federal Reserve speakers for any comments they may make about the future of interest rates.Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/21524673/delayed DJU4 +0.20% rose 28 points, or 0.2%, to 16,870, while those for the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/11777331/delayed SPU4 +0.19% gained 3.6 points, or 0.2%, to 1,961.40. The Nasdaq 100 index /quotes/zigman/17563580/delayed NDU4 +0.32% tacked on 12 points, or 0.3%, to 3,885.50.Second-quarter results from Wells Fargo & Co. /quotes/zigman/239557/delayed/quotes/nls/wfc WFC -0.73% are expected to arrive ahead of the opening bell. Earnings at the U.S.’s largest mortgage provider are expected to come in at $1.01 a share. That would compare with 98 cents a share in the year-ago period, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. Wells Fargo has had 17-straight quarters of rising profits, despite sluggish results from its peers.Analysts will watch, in part, how Wells Fargo curbed a slowdown in mortgage refinancing because of rising rates.Worries about the fragility of Europe’s banking system triggered losses on Wall Street Thursday, but the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX -0.41% , the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA -0.42%  and the Nasdaq Composite /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP -0.52%  finished well off session lows.European stocks were bouncing back Friday after Thursday’s drop, which came as Portuguese conglomerate Espírito Santo International SA this week missed a payment on some short-term debt. That sent shares of its subsidiaries, Banco Espirito Santo AS and Espirito Santo Financial Group SA, spiraling lower.“The fact Europe is rebounding from yesterday’s sell-off is helping cheer Wall Street futures,” said Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, in a note Friday. The Dow industrials are “in easy reach of 17,000, so assuming there are no other surprises — and based on the assumption that a degree of short covering ahead of the weekend break is as good as inevitable — then the week could well end on a positive tone in New York.”With the market trying to pin down when interest rates will be raised by the Federal Reserve, appearances by central bank officials are of interest to investors. In Jackson Hole, Wyo., Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser at 11:15 a.m. Eastern Time will moderate a panel on entrepreneurial issues at the Global Interdependence Center’s Rocky Mountain Summit.Plosser — known as a hawk — is a voting member of the Fed’s policy committee this year. Plosser last month said the federal funds rate should be raised starting in the third quarter , and that rates should be higher because the central bank is nearing its goals faster than many expected.At 3 p.m. Eastern Time, Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, and Dennis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed Bank, will be on a panel about success and failures of Fed policy. Lockhart has said he expects short-term rates will be held at zero until the latter half of 2015, while Evans has said it may not be until 2016 that the Fed starts on its rate-hike path. Evans and Lockhart are not voting members on the policy committee this year.Also on the radar Friday, tobacco giant Reynolds American Inc. /quotes/zigman/334469/delayed/quotes/nls/rai RAI -0.65%   confirmed that it’s in talks with Lorillard Inc. /quotes/zigman/511272/delayed/quotes/nls/lo LO +0.13%  about a possible acquisition. Lorillard shares rose nearly 5% in premarket trade.Fastenal Co. /quotes/zigman/71860/delayed/quotes/nls/fast FAST -1.74% , which makes fasteners, tools and other industrial and construction supplies, reported second-quarter earnings of 44 cents a share on sales of $949.9 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting per-share earnings of 44 cents on revenue of $952.5 million. Shares fell 3% in scant premarket volume following the results.An influential broadcaster in China said the location-tracking function in Apple Inc.’s /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL -0.37%  iPhone was a “national security concern,” in the latest backlash against U.S. tech firms.Late Thursday, apparel retailer Gap Inc. /quotes/zigman/227242/delayed/quotes/nls/gps GPS -1.09%  reported an unexpected 2% drop in same-store sales in June. Shares fell more than 1% in late trading Thursday.In other markets Friday, crude for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.38%   fell 37 cents, or 0.4%, to $102.55 a barrel. August gold /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 -0.07% fell 50 cents to $1,338.70 an ounce. Overnight in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei Average /quotes/zigman/5986735/delayed JP:NIK -0.34%  fell 0.3% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index ended flat.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Keep running.

What the financial services industry is talking about	By Jennifer OpenshawIn conversations with top leaders at the 2014 Money Management Institute (MMI) convention, investing strategies — and goals-based investing in particular — were the hot themes. The MMI represents the global financial services organizations that provide advice and professionally-managed investment solutions to individual and institutional investors.“The client has access to so many building blocks now,” said Philip Camporeale, a portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, noting the development of new “alternative” products in the wake of the financial crisis that differ from typical equity or bond investment products.“We’ve all talked about the traditional investing approach of 60%stocks and 40% bonds,” he added. “But if you look at how that’s gone, especially in 2008, it’s not good. People had way too much in equities.”He adds: “The world of money management five years from now will be nothing like the last 15 years.”It’s a topic that drives not only how you might interact with your adviser, but the types of investments investors and advisers alike might utilize.Goals-based investing vs. cash-flow investingWith goal-based investing, advisers focus on either a specific rate of return or funding a specific outcome, such as health care and other big-ticket needs. It differs from the traditional approach of generating a return against an investment benchmark.Alexandra Levi, managing partner of Element Financial Group, who spoke at the MMI event, says a goals-based approach focuses on the client’s mindset and where they need to go.She described a client who, in late 2008, had what she described as a great relationship with her previous financial adviser only to discover — in the wake of the financial crisis — that she liquidated her $12 million portfolio on March 9 and faced a 50% drop in value the next day.“The client had no long-term perspective of her portfolio,” said Levi. “Rather than focusing on day-to-day market performance, goals-based investing tells you what needs to happen so that you can retire, sell a business or fund whatever need you have. “For retirement goals, that “need” or annualized return Levi aims for is 6% to 7.5% on an annualized basis, depending on a client’s age or time horizon.While goals-based investing recognizes that you do not need the highest performance to achieve your goal, other advisers at the MMI event disagreed, saying they favor generating a predictable cash-flow instead.Bonds and alternatives during retirement?And what about bonds or so-called “alternatives” like hedge funds, futures, and natural resources?Bonds have traditionally played a key role in retirees’ portfolios, generating income to cover living and other expenses. But experts say new, alternative products, such as hedge funds created since the 2008 crisis, are making their way into client portfolios.“The hedge-fund manager thinks more like an individual client,” says Jim Celico, Managing Director of F-Squared Alternative Investments.He adds that more clients might be happy with this philosophy because it creates a return stream more in line with an investor’s own mindset.Advisor Levi includes alternatives in client portfolios but requires that they be “liquid, transparent and marketable.” In other words, know what you’re investing in and be sure you can get out of it by selling, if needed. Two examples: Brinker Capital’s absolute return strategy, the Crystal Strategy, and Goldman Sachs’ Strategic Income Fund.“It’s not a transparent market and a lot of clients have been taken advantage of,” she points out.And what about old-fashioned bonds? Experts here had different opinions about whether to include municipal and other bonds, given the historically low interest rate environment.In fact, F-Squared’s Celico questioned why the focus of his panel centered on alternatives and not on traditional, income-generating bonds.“Aren’t most retirees buying munis? Why is no one saying that it’s not so bad to earn income off fixed income?”He questioned whether newer alternative products will have a “short life cycle” once rates rise.“Might we look back and say, ‘why did we do that?’ If that’s the case, all the questions about generating yield make sense. Maybe the things we used in the past will come back in vogue.”But Camporeale asked the audience: “What if this is the 1950s with a staircase rise in rates? You don’t get to 4% until 10 years or 6% until 20 years?”	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=24082686-084D-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11
Imperial Tobacco in talks to buy brands from Reynolds, Lorillard	By Peter EvansImperial /quotes/zigman/167179/delayed UK:IMT +3.43% , the maker of Lambert & Butler and Gauloises cigarettes, is aiming to expand in the U.S. market, which it says is still “one of the world’s largest and most profitable cigarette markets.” Imperial currently has around a 3% share of U.S. cigarette sales.Imperial didn’t disclose any financial details and said there was no certainty of a deal taking place.But the statement by the world’s fourth-largest cigarette maker could have far wider significance: It could force U.S. tobacco giants Reynolds /quotes/zigman/334469/delayed/quotes/nls/rai RAI -0.65%  and Lorillard /quotes/zigman/511272/delayed/quotes/nls/lo LO +0.13%  to make official their long-rumored talks of a merger.The potential takeover would combine leading Reynolds cigarette brands such as Camel and Pall Mall with Lorillard’s Newport, the top-selling menthol cigarette.To satisfy antitrust authorities and help finance its takeover of Lorillard, Reynolds could sell several of its smaller brands, including Winston, Kool and Salem. Imperial is seen by some analysts as a likely buyer for some of the brands cast off for antitrust reasons.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.comMore must-reads from MarketWatch:5 things to know about Banco Espirito Santo and EuropeStocks, bonds now moving together in lock-stepWoman arrested in Google exec’s yacht death	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CB5362EE-08DD-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

Gold miner rally ‘foreshadows a trend’ for the metal’	By Myra P. Saefong, MarketWatchA little over halfway into the year, mining stocks have recouped roughly half of what they lost in 2013 and scored about double the percentage gains seen in gold prices.Gold-mining stocks “generally lead gold, both in the direction of the moves and in the extent of those moves,” said Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter.The NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index /quotes/zigman/6015494/realtime XX:HUI -1.80%  has climbed about 22% year to date, after losing 56% last year, while the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index /quotes/zigman/1475600/delayed XAU -1.98%  has gained 21% this year following a loss of 49% in 2013.The performances for the indexes strongly outdo the 11% year-to-date climb for gold futures prices /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 -0.06% , which lost 28% last year.“The gold stocks typically begin rising or falling in advance of the metal, thereby foreshadowing the trend,” Lundin said, adding that “they move further on a percentage basis than the underlying metal, thereby offering leverage.”So “the fact that the gold stocks are outperforming gold so far this year is a very bullish indicator for gold itself,” he said.Already, the gold market may have marked an end to the “summer doldrums,” a period in which the sector experiences a slow buying period—and prices may have bottomed.Gold and gold-stock markets usually bottom sometime between the middle of July and the middle of August, said Lundin, but this year, it seems they bottomed much earlier—in early June and are now climbing slowly higher.Prices slipped below $1,250 in early June and have gained more than $80 an ounce since then.“Fundamentals, technicals and market sentiment are now lined up for a powerful advance,” said Ken Ford, founding partner at Warwick Valley Financial Advisors.He expects the Federal Reserve and other central banks to “be behind the curve” with regard to raising rates and expects to see a pickup in inflation expectations moving forward.Once gold clears $1,400 an ounce, the “basing pattern” for prices, following the major bottom they formed over the past year, will be complete and gold will “resume its secular bull trend,” Ford said.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CEA4EBC2-084A-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

World Cup legacy for soccer: more attacking offense	By Matthew FuttermanThe next day, giant-killer Costa Rica swarmed a defensive Uruguayan team with three second-half goals, punishing the 2010 semifinalists for their passivity. Two days later, U.S. captain Clint Dempsey scored just 29 seconds into the game, his ears still buzzing with the parting words of coach Jürgen Klinsmann just before kickoff: “Attack!”This week brought the ultimate onslaught — Germany’s merciless, 7-1 thrashing of host Brazil, which brought the whole concept of the “attack” to an entirely new level.After years of timid, low-scoring play, that one word has become the theme of Brazil’s World Cup. When the history of this tournament is written, the sport’s cognoscenti will likely point to it as an event that changed the game. The finalists, Germany and Argentina, have survived the most offense-oriented tournament of the modern era, a series of games where playing defensively almost guaranteed an early exit.“There is no clear defensive strategy anymore,” said France coach Didier Deschamps, whose, young, lightning-fast team romped through its group, scoring eight goals in its first two games. “I remember a few years ago, there were some very boring World Cup matches. Not this year. Now it’s end-to-end soccer, it goes from one box to the other, and it’s really entertaining,” he said.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B8D27AAC-0882-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

Oil dips below $102, on track for a weekly drop	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchWest Texas intermediate crude for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.98%  fell $1.10, or 1.1%, to $101.83 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a day after breaking a nine-day losing streak. Based on the most-active contracts, prices haven’t closed below $102 since May 15. They trade roughly 2.1% lower for the week.August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -1.01%  fell $1.15, or 1.1%, to $107.52 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange, with the contract set to lose 2.8% for the week.The International Energy Agency on Friday said Iraqi production fell by 260,000 barrels a day last month after violence in the north of the country, but increased supply from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria and Angola offset the decline to leave OPEC production broadly steady at 30 million barrels a day in June.The report is likely “providing confirmation of traders’ beliefs that the market isn’t as tight as they previously feared, but no more than that,” Matt Parry, senior oil analyst at the Paris-based IEA told MarketWatch in an email.Taking a look at 2015, non-OPEC supply growth is forecast to underperform demand for the first time in three years, “potentially keeping the market relatively well balanced,” he said. “Of course, that depends upon geopolitical issues which have been unusually heightened in recent times.”Oil futures rallied to nine-month highs in June as the fighting erupted, but have subsequently retreated on expectations Iraq’s main oil production and export facilities in the south of the country will remain insulated from the violence.Also on Nymex Friday, August gasoline /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 -0.89%  fell nearly 3 cents to $2.93 a gallon, ready for a weekly loss of around 3%, while August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821453/delayed HOQ4 -0.35% also fell nearly 2 cents to $2.88 a gallon, trading 1.8% lower on the week.August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 +0.05%  was at $4.13 per million British thermal units, up a half cent, but poised for a hefty loss of more than 6% for the week.Gold stock rally ‘foreshadows a trend’ for the metalIEA: Little room for complacency in oil markets5 things to know about Banco Espirito Santo and Europe	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3C45C78E-08F8-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11
Gold consolidates as Portugal worries fade	By William L. Watts, MarketWatchGold for August delivery /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 -0.20% fell 20 cents, or less than 0.1%, to $1,339 an ounce. September silver /quotes/zigman/12294966/delayed SIU4 -0.20% fell less than a penny to $21.50 an ounce.Gold is on track for a 1.3% weekly rise and is up 11.3% in 2014.“The marketplace is more at ease Friday morning, following the keener risk aversion that occurred Thursday due to renewed worries about the health of the European Union’s financial system — specifically a major bank in Portugal that is in trouble,” wrote Jim Wyckoff, analyst at Kitco.Gold on Thursday closed at its highest level for a nearby futures contract since March 19, boosted in part by safe-haven demand spurred by concerns over Portuguese lender Banco Espirito Santo, which served to remind investors of the long-dormant euro-zone debt crisis.

U.S. stocks: Futures rebound; Wells Fargo earnings next	By Carla Mozee, MarketWatchInvestors also will monitor appearances by three Federal Reserve speakers for any comments they may make about the future of interest rates.Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/21524673/delayed DJU4 +0.20% rose 28 points, or 0.2%, to 16,870, while those for the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/11777331/delayed SPU4 +0.09% gained 3.6 points, or 0.2%, to 1,961.40. The Nasdaq 100 index /quotes/zigman/17563580/delayed NDU4 +0.32% tacked on 12 points, or 0.3%, to 3,885.50.Second-quarter results from Wells Fargo & Co. /quotes/zigman/239557/delayed/quotes/nls/wfc WFC -0.73% are expected to arrive ahead of the opening bell. Earnings at the U.S.’s largest mortgage provider are expected to come in at $1.01 a share. That would compare with 98 cents a share in the year-ago period, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. Wells Fargo has had 17-straight quarters of rising profits, despite sluggish results from its peers.Analysts will watch, in part, how Wells Fargo curbed a slowdown in mortgage refinancing because of rising rates.Worries about the fragility of Europe’s banking system triggered losses on Wall Street Thursday, but the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX -0.41% , the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA -0.42%  and the Nasdaq Composite /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP -0.52%  finished well off session lows.European stocks were bouncing back Friday after Thursday’s drop, which came as Portuguese conglomerate Espírito Santo International SA this week missed a payment on some short-term debt. That sent shares of its subsidiaries, Banco Espirito Santo AS and Espirito Santo Financial Group SA, spiraling lower.“The fact Europe is rebounding from yesterday’s sell-off is helping cheer Wall Street futures,” said Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, in a note Friday. The Dow industrials are “in easy reach of 17,000, so assuming there are no other surprises — and based on the assumption that a degree of short covering ahead of the weekend break is as good as inevitable — then the week could well end on a positive tone in New York.”With the market trying to pin down when interest rates will be raised by the Federal Reserve, appearances by central bank officials are of interest to investors. In Jackson Hole, Wyo., Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser at 11:15 a.m. Eastern Time will moderate a panel on entrepreneurial issues at the Global Interdependence Center’s Rocky Mountain Summit.Plosser — known as a hawk — is a voting member of the Fed’s policy committee this year. Plosser last month said the federal funds rate should be raised starting in the third quarter , and that rates should be higher because the central bank is nearing its goals faster than many expected.At 3 p.m. Eastern Time, Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, and Dennis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed Bank, will be on a panel about success and failures of Fed policy. Lockhart has said he expects short-term rates will be held at zero until the latter half of 2015, while Evans has said it may not be until 2016 that the Fed starts on its rate-hike path. Evans and Lockhart are not voting members on the policy committee this year.Also on the radar Friday, tobacco giant Reynolds American Inc. /quotes/zigman/334469/delayed/quotes/nls/rai RAI -0.65%   confirmed that it’s in talks with Lorillard Inc. /quotes/zigman/511272/delayed/quotes/nls/lo LO +0.13%  about a possible acquisition.

Shares fell more than 1% in late trading Thursday.In other markets Friday, crude for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.62%   fell 37 cents, or 0.4%, to $102.55 a barrel. August gold /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 -0.18% fell 50 cents to $1,338.70 an ounce.

Israel trades rocket fire with Lebanon amid Gaza conflict	By Nicholas Casey and Joshua MitnickThe Israel Defense Forces said a rocket landed near the northern town of Metula Friday morning. Israel returned fire into Lebanon. It wasn’t clear who shot the rocket, the IDF said.In the southern city of Ashdod, a rocket from Gaza landed on a gas station, injuring a 50-year-old man whose hand had to be amputated, according to Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz. The newspaper published pictures of fire and billowing flames rising from the gas station, which it said was next to a nursing home.In Tel Aviv, rocket sirens sounded on Friday morning. The IDF said three rockets were launched from Gaza toward central Israel and were intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system.Meanwhile, the IDF continued its aerial assault on Gaza overnight. The death toll rose to 98 Palestinians killed with 670 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.Israel has mobilized 20,000 reservists for a possible ground operation into Gaza.President Barack Obama called Prime Minister Netanyahu Thursday and offered U.S. help to halt the current hostilities between Israel and Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza.

U.S. stocks: Futures rebound; Wells Fargo meets estimates	By Anora Mahmudova and Carla Mozee, MarketWatchInvestors also will monitor appearances by three Federal Reserve speakers for any comments they may make about the future of interest rates.Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/21524673/delayed DJU4 +0.20% were 15 points, or 0.1%, higher at 16,857, while those for the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/11777331/delayed SPU4 +0.04% gained 2 points, or 0.1%, to 1,959.90. The Nasdaq 100 index /quotes/zigman/17563580/delayed NDU4 +0.14% tacked on 10 points, or 0.3%, to 3,883.75.Wells Fargo & Co. /quotes/zigman/239557/delayed/quotes/nls/wfc WFC -1.52% said its second-quarter profit rose even as revenue declined. Per-share earnings were $1.01 and in line with expectations, but revenue decline was less than expected. Shares were slightly lower in premarket.This quarter marks Wells Fargo’s 18th consecutive quarter of rising profits, despite sluggish results from its peers.Worries about the fragility of Europe’s banking system triggered losses on Wall Street Thursday, but the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX -0.13% , the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA -0.20%  and the Nasdaq Composite /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP +0.08%  finished well off session lows.European stocks were bouncing back Friday after Thursday’s drop, which came as Portuguese conglomerate Espírito Santo International SA this week missed a payment on some short-term debt. That sent shares of its subsidiaries, Banco Espirito Santo AS and Espirito Santo Financial Group SA, spiraling lower.“The fact Europe is rebounding from yesterday’s sell-off is helping cheer Wall Street futures,” said Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, in a note Friday. The Dow industrials are “in easy reach of 17,000, so assuming there are no other surprises — and based on the assumption that a degree of short covering ahead of the weekend break is as good as inevitable — then the week could well end on a positive tone in New York.”With the market trying to pin down when interest rates will be raised by the Federal Reserve, appearances by central bank officials are of interest to investors. In Jackson Hole, Wyo., Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser at 11:15 a.m. Eastern Time will moderate a panel on entrepreneurial issues at the Global Interdependence Center’s Rocky Mountain Summit.Plosser — known as a hawk — is a voting member of the Fed’s policy committee this year. Plosser last month said the federal funds rate should be raised starting in the third quarter , and that rates should be higher because the central bank is nearing its goals faster than many expected.At 3 p.m. Eastern Time, Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, and Dennis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed Bank, will be on a panel about success and failures of Fed policy. Lockhart has said he expects short-term rates will be held at zero until the latter half of 2015, while Evans has said it may not be until 2016 that the Fed starts on its rate-hike path. Evans and Lockhart are not voting members on the policy committee this year.Also on the radar Friday, tobacco giant Reynolds American Inc. /quotes/zigman/334469/delayed/quotes/nls/rai RAI -0.74%   confirmed that it’s in talks with Lorillard Inc. /quotes/zigman/511272/delayed/quotes/nls/lo LO +4.64%  about a possible acquisition. Lorillard shares rose nearly 5% in premarket trade.Fastenal Co. /quotes/zigman/71860/delayed/quotes/nls/fast FAST -4.43% , which makes fasteners, tools and other industrial and construction supplies, reported second-quarter earnings of 44 cents a share on sales of $949.9 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting per-share earnings of 44 cents on revenue of $952.5 million. Shares fell 1% in scant premarket volume following the results.An influential broadcaster in China said the location-tracking function in Apple Inc.’s /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +0.27%  iPhone was a “national security concern,” in the latest backlash against U.S. tech firms.Late Thursday, apparel retailer Gap Inc. /quotes/zigman/227242/delayed/quotes/nls/gps GPS -1.03%  reported an unexpected 2% drop in same-store sales in June. Shares fell more than 1% in late trading Thursday.In other markets Friday, crude for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.85%   fell 37 cents, or 0.4%, to $102.55 a barrel.

IEA: Little room for complacency in oil markets	By Sarah KentIn its closely watched monthly oil market report, the Paris-based energy watchdog forecast rising demand growth and a steady increase in supply from non-Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for 2015.It said global demand for oil will accelerate to 1.4 million barrels a day from 1.2 million barrels a day this year, while oil supply from outside OPEC will increase by around 1.2 million barrels a day, continuing the trend of robust non-OPEC production.However, the IEA warned that the risks associated with its 2015 demand forecast are “particularly high” due to the uncertain global economic recovery and geopolitical tensions in a host of countries, including Iraq, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela, are adding to the macroeconomic uncertainties.The same political issues in major oil-producing countries also pose a threat to oil supply, it said.Iraqi production fell by 260,000 barrels a day last month after violence in the north forced the closure of the country’s largest refinery and cut output from the giant Kirkuk field to a trickle. Meanwhile, logistical issues and maintenance at Basrah cut output from Iraq’s southern fields by 160,000 barrels a day.Increased supply from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria and Angola offset the decline in Iraq, leaving OPEC production broadly steady at 30 million barrels a day in June.6 big-bank stocks with the best prospectsMining stocks point to gains for gold pricesPortugal’s bank woes a ‘glimpse’ of future credit market troubles	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=29996B10-08FB-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

2,000 days of Obama: How have stocks done?	By Russ Britt, MarketWatchObama was sworn in amid extreme financial turmoil in January 2009, roughly six weeks before the stock markets hit bottom in the wake of the Great Recession. Pretty much the only direction for stocks to go was up.How far up, though? More important, how do gains under Obama compare with gains under other presidents who made it to 2,000 days?Answer: He’s in the top half of the eight presidents since the Great Depression whose time in office lasted that long. That can always change, of course. And there’s considerable debate over whether he -- or any other president for that matter -- can influence the stock market or whether they’re just along for the ride.“I wouldn’t be looking to give the administration a lot of credit for the stock market’s [performance],” said Sam Stovall, managing director of U.S. Equity Strategy at S&P Capital IQ. He notes, however, that stocks generally do better under Democrats than Republicans, particularly when stocks start out low.As of right now, Obama ranks third behind top-finisher Bill Clinton and runner-up Franklin Delano Roosevelt in terms of stock gains, according to our calculations. After Obama, in order, it’s Ronald Reagan, Dwight Eisenhower, Harry Truman, George W. Bush and Richard Nixon. (Yes, Nixon barely made it in this club; he resigned 2,027 days into his presidency amid the Watergate scandal.)There are a few surprises in the data. First, Obama not only finished ahead of Reagan, thought by many to be the architect of one of the greatest economic recoveries of the 20th century, he will be well ahead of him when his 2,000th day comes on Saturday. Major stock indexes have averaged gains of more than 140% under Obama, while they were up 88% at this same point in the Reagan years.Pan the economic lens out, though, and the gap closes. You’ll see stock gains averaged just under 113% when Reagan completed his full eight years, or 2,922 days in office. That’s still short of the market’s advance under Obama, but all it would take is a cumulative drop of roughly 10% in the three indexes, and Obama could fall below that mark by the time his second term ends.Which is within the realm of possibility. Note that the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA -0.22%   thrived during Reagan’s last 2 1/2 years despite the 1987 crash, and ended up gaining more than 130% in all, well ahead of Obama’s current 104% gain. On the other hand, the Nasdaq Composite Index /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP +0.04%   has flourished under Obama, up 189% thus far compared with 94% for Reagan’s two full terms.Another surprise, also sure to rankle the right, is that stock market gains under four post-Depression Democrats on their 2,000th day in office have outpaced that of the four Republicans in the same era by a factor of nearly 4 to 1. Democratic gains have averaged 132% while Republican increases are at a mean of 33%.Stovall notes that pattern follows historic precedent. When there’s a split Congress, Democratic presidents see four times the gains that Republicans do, as well as when Democratic administrations do battle with a unified Republican Congress. Markets, however, do better under Republicans when they control the White House and both houses of Congress than when Democrats are in the same catbird seat.Before embarking further, a word about MarketWatch’s methodology. We averaged the changes in the Dow, Nasdaq and the S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX -0.16%  for the first 2,000 days for four of the eight post-Depression presidents who made it that far: Reagan, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. For Eisenhower and Nixon, only Dow and S&P data were available. And for Roosevelt and Truman it was just the Dow.Starting with the Jan. 20 Inauguration Day, the 2,000th page on the office calendar turned for six of the presidents halfway through their sixth year on July 12. The dates were different for Roosevelt, who was first sworn in back when Inauguration Day was March 4, and Truman, who assumed power when Roosevelt died shortly into his fourth term in April 1945.For the sake of doing this sooner rather than later, we’re jumping the gun a little on Obama, whose 2,000th day isn’t until Saturday. But unless the markets drop more than 20% on Friday, he should hang on to his current standing.We didn’t just limit our examination to 2,000-day presidents, we also looked at stock gains under all chief executives since FDR. In that study, Obama would remain in the top three even if stocks were flat for the rest of his term, and he would climb to second behind Clinton if they grew at their current pace. If they drop, of course, it’s anyone’s guess where the Obama presidency ends up in investing history.A few caveats: Economists have done similar examinations that probably are more scientific than MarketWatch’s. One potential flaw is that we didn’t take dividends or inflation into account; the percentage gains are based solely on nominal numbers available.We figure that we’re looking at percentage gains during that 5 1/2-year window where inflation largely remained a constant through that period. Feel free to poke holes in that logic. Morgan Housel, senior analyst at Motley Fool, wasn’t afraid to do so.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=4DD1E68E-0841-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11
MGIC, Radian shares drop in premarket following FHFA proposal	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Shares of MGIC Investment /quotes/zigman/234104/delayed/quotes/nls/mtg MTG -12.66% tumbled 14% in active premarket trade after the mortgage-insurer said late Thursday the Federal Housing Finance Agencys newly-proposed standards for the industry would mean its available assets would be materially less than the minimum requirements.

Benchmark Treasurys set for best week since March	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR -0.67%  yield, which falls as prices rise, was down 1 basis point at 2.523%, according to Tradeweb. The yield is set to fall for its fifth consecutive session, marking a 10 basis point weekly drop. That’s the biggest fall since mid-March, according to FactSet.Treasury prices continued to drift higher Friday morning, despite an easing of fears related to Portugal’s largest bank, Banco Espirito Santo, which had sent global tremors through markets on Thursday.The rise was attributed in part to reports of large overnight buyers out of Asia, geopolitical conflict, and expectations that the Federal Reserve would continue to keep its key lending rates low, strategists said.Data showed that primary dealers sold $29.5 billion of Treasurys in the week ended last Wednesday, matching the largest selling on record, according to CRT Capital Group.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR -0.77%  yield fell 1.5 basis points to 3.349% and the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR -0.36%  yield was unchanged at 1.650%.Fed officials took differing views on inflation Friday. Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed Bank, said that inflation is likely to stay below the 2% target for a “few years,” in a television interview. Meanwhile, Charles Plosser, president of the Fed Bank of Philadelphia, said that inflation numbers, which show a drift higher, are not noise.Wells Fargo’s cost-cutting program stalls6 big-bank stocks with the best prospects5 celebrity money mistakes we can all learn from	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7D01E636-0902-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11
Here’s a thrill ride: Your roller coaster may not have been inspected	By Priya Anand, MarketWatchThe estimated number of U.S. emergency room visits for amusement ride-related injuries reached 27,054 last year, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. That’s down from 2012, when that figure jumped to more than 30,000, but follows steady increases over the last decade. The incidents may be just a small fraction of the nearly 300 million people who take about 1.7 billion safe rides at 400 U.S. amusement parks annually, according to estimates by the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, but the increases in injuries and inconsistencies in safety guidelines have become a concern.Four people were hurt in the Monday accident at Magic Mountain, and two others were taken to the hospital as a precaution, according to media reports. Mobile rides — like those at traveling carnivals — fall under the purview of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. But there are no national safety standards for fixed amusement park rides, which are regulated by hodgepodge state and local laws. What that means for riders: You could hop onto a machine that’s annually inspected by a state official in New Jersey, where rides are also subject to random inspection throughout the season. But in Alabama — where there’s no state oversight over the few amusement parks — good luck.“There are huge inconsistencies in state regulation,” says Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and senior counsel at the Consumer Federation of America, where she handles product-safety issues. “There really is very little indication of whether a ride could pose risk. Consumers don’t think they’re going to be severely injured or tragically killed at a park.”Alabama is one of six states that don’t regulate amusement rides, according to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, joined by Mississippi, Nevada, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Utah.Last year, Six Flags /quotes/zigman/597013/delayed/quotes/nls/six SIX +0.17%  Over Texas initiated an investigation into the death of a woman on one if its own roller coasters, NBC News reported, because the state doesn’t take responsibility for inspections.While he was in the House of Representatives, Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts ,introduced multiple bills to regulate amusement rides, most recently in 2011. None passed.“CPSC stands ready for any regulation approved by Congress,” Nychelle Fleming, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission told MarketWatch when asked if the agency supports broadening its jurisdiction to include stationary amusement rides. The agency also said people can contact their state authorities and speak with park management to learn more about safety practices at the parks they visit.In Wyoming, where there are no major theme parks, it might make sense that there’s no state oversight program, says Laura Woodburn, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Amusement Ride Safety Officials, a nonprofit of local agencies, insurance companies, consultants, federal agencies and amusement safety officials. The group offers education and certification programs in the field, and Woodburn said it would “not judge the states in how they choose to run their programs.”She said park-goers should watch ride operators to make sure they are paying attention, and that their family and friends are following ride instructions, like height requirements.Action Park in New Jersey reopened last month, after closing in 1996. Under its old name, Mountain Creek Waterpark, it had developed a reputation as the park to visit for injuries, not fun. The park was home to 103 of the 552 serious injuries at the state’s amusement parks — accounting for about 20% of the accidents across 15 parks, according to state data obtained by NJ.com.While people can search for inspection stickers on rides and make sure they follow operating directions by keeping their hands inside and fastening belts, it would be difficult for visitors to figure out how much each device has been tested and when, given the varying state laws.“People think they’re assuming some risk, but I think they don’t realize how much risk they actually are assuming when they choose to go to amusement parks,” Weintraub says.More from MarketWatch:5 celebrity money mistakes we can all learn fromMurderer turned stock-picker is ‘Oracle of San Quentin’Social Security loophole’s windfall opportunity	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9EE75CCA-0904-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

Brazil World Cup legacy: more attacking, more goals	By Matthew FuttermanThe next day, giant-killer Costa Rica swarmed a defensive Uruguayan team with three second-half goals, punishing the 2010 semifinalists for their passivity. Two days later, U.S. captain Clint Dempsey scored just 29 seconds into the game, his ears still buzzing with the parting words of coach Jürgen Klinsmann just before kickoff: “Attack!”This week brought the ultimate onslaught — Germany’s merciless, 7-1 thrashing of host Brazil, which brought the whole concept of the “attack” to an entirely new level.After years of timid, low-scoring play, that one word has become the theme of Brazil’s World Cup. When the history of this tournament is written, the sport’s cognoscenti will likely point to it as an event that changed the game. The finalists, Germany and Argentina, have survived the most offense-oriented tournament of the modern era, a series of games where playing defensively almost guaranteed an early exit.“There is no clear defensive strategy anymore,” said France coach Didier Deschamps, whose, young, lightning-fast team romped through its group, scoring eight goals in its first two games. “I remember a few years ago, there were some very boring World Cup matches. Not this year. Now it’s end-to-end soccer, it goes from one box to the other, and it’s really entertaining,” he said.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B8D27AAC-0882-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

Feds Evans sees inflation staying below 2% for few years	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Inflation is likely to stay below the Federal Reserves 2% target for a few years, said Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed Bank, on Friday. Asked in an interview on Bloomberg TV what he would need to see before he decided to support a rate hike, Evans replied: I am going to be paying a lot of attention to the inflation outlook. I think we need to get up to 2% in sustainable fashion and that is probably going to be one of the biggest issues. Evans said he expects inflation to only average 1.5% to 1.75% for a couple of years There continue to be pressures that are going to hold inflation down, he said. Evans said it would not be a catastrophe for inflation to rise above 2%, noting that it has been well below that level for quite some time. We need to average 2%, he said. Evans was optimistic about the economy, seeing 3% growth going forward. His comments suggest no hurry to hike interest rates. Evans, who is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee this year, said the Fed wouldnt meet its goals of stable prices and maximum employment until late in 2016.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=D5617D34-A97F-4688-9A0B-0C31945ADF9B&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

SolarCity up 3%, but gains don’t erase weekly loss	By Claudia Assis, MarketWatchSolarCity /quotes/zigman/13139813/delayed/quotes/nls/scty SCTY +1.69%  rose 3%, capping a week of losses of more than 5% so far.

Sneaker trend change may hurt Finish Line: analyst	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- A shift in demand from high-priced running sneakers to lower-priced retro style running shoes will likely hurt Finish Lines /quotes/zigman/71779/delayed/quotes/nls/finl FINL -5.03% results for the foreseeable future, Sterne Agee analyst Sam Poser said in a report downgrading the specialty athletic retailers stock to neutral from buy. He said retro running styles including Nikes /quotes/zigman/235840/delayed/quotes/nls/nke NKE -0.88% Poshe Run, New Balances 574, Asics Ultimate 81 and Sauconys Jazz Original have average selling prices that are about 20% lower than performance shoes such as Nikes Lunar line and Asics Gel -Kayano, at $160 a pop. We do not believe that (Finish Line) can drive the necessary increase in traffic both in store and on line to offset the lower average selling prices, Poser said. The shift to the lower priced retro styles puts (Finish Line) in a much more competitive environment against fashion retailers such as Journeys, and many better department stores and Finish Line will likely drift further behind Foot Locker. Finish Line shares fell 5.6% to $27.21. Foot Locker was down 1.2% to $50. Foot Locker /quotes/zigman/293726/delayed/quotes/nls/fl FL -1.35% has benefited from higher sales of basketball shoes, including the Nike Jordan line.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=46C13E2A-C47C-4A02-9B1E-ECF14C8EF01D&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11
Will the iWatch be a game changer for Apple?	By Bill GundersonSo far, the smartwatches that have hit the market have had little utility beyond fitness tracking, and there are already plenty of those products out on the market. On the business side, wrist notifications might be handy so you dont miss those important texts or tasks or appointments. But again, that functionality has failed to catch on.But lurking in the wings is Apples iWatch. By not being the first to market, Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +0.32%  has allowed its competitors to be the beta testers for these products, figuring out the real-use case for the category. Given that its competitors have failed so miserably, the other important reason that Apple wants the iWatch to succeed is to help re-solidify its position in peoples minds as a product innovator and category king.The iWatch is just one of the products that Apple is expected to launch this fall, including the new bigger iPhone 6. Investors are waiting to see how successfully Apple will execute these new product launches.Ahead of the iWatch launch it was announced that Apple just snagged Swiss luxury watchmaker Tag Heuers VP of Sales, Patrick Pruniaux. His hire is another hint that Apple is trying to establish itself in the marketplace as a luxury brand. Apple also recently hired Burberrys former CEO Angela Ahrendts to revamp Apples retail sales effort and brought in Yves Saint Laurents former CEO Paul Deneve to work on special projects, reporting to Tim Cook. Many have speculated that special projectis related to the design of the iWatch.Given all the cash that Apple has on its balance sheet, it can certainly afford to hire some high-profile talent. Apple also recently acquired luxury headphone brand Beats Electronics for $3 billion and retained the companys co-founders Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.One thing for sure about wearable technology is that you have to make people want to wear it. Wearable devices are as much about image as they are functionality. Has Apple built a better smartwatch? Will the iWatch be a product game changer for the company like the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad? That remains to be seen. But ahead of the new product buzz and excitement, Apple stock is trading at new highs.Instead of focusing on the hype of a single new product, which may succeed or fail, it is more important to look at the company holistically.Best Stocks Now analysisOn April 3, when Apple stock was still unloved, my Best Stocks Now app identified the fact that Apple had good earnings and was reasonably valued with a P/E of only 13. At that time, Apple stock was trading at around $76 per share, and I commented that in a market favoring value, it was strange that Apple ranked number 495 in my 3800-plus-stock universe. On April 28, the stock began to break out and moved up to number 64 in my rankings. I began initiating a position in the stock in May. And since that time, the stocks performance has been sensational...............Apple is exactly the type of stock that should be rewarded in this market. It has a low P/E of only 14 and is a lower-risk, conservative, mega-cap stock. It even pays a dividend yield of 2.1%.Even after its recent rally, the stock is trading at a reasonable valuation. Should Apples new product cycle gain traction, the estimated annual growth rate of 12% per year should accelerate...............Data from Best Stocks Now app	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5216F448-E0D5-4580-844E-CEB989187D44&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11
Dont let disruption disrupt your investing	By Barry RandallIts practically received wisdom that the road to success requires that your business model be not just incrementally better than competitors, but instead be so disruptive that incumbents will fail, their supporters and investors will be convulsed with a need to sell all their worldly possessions and (having lost the will to live) throw themselves into a volcano.OK, Im being a little facetious here, but not very.Lepores article was clearly well researched and fact-checked. But her tone gave me the distinct impression that mostly she was tired of the concept and believed disruptions adherents had allowed it to be hijacked in the service of some dubious agendas.The original adherent was best-selling author (and fellow Harvard prof) Clayton Christensen. Christensen popularized disruption in the best-selling Innovators Dilemma. Christensen wasnt especially thrilled by Lepores evisceration of his pet theory even though he agreed with several of her criticisms. In our current ultra-low-volatility world, the media, hungry for anything to move the controversy needle into the red zone, threw some gas on the fire .I dont think Vince McMahon will be offering these academic wonks a chance for a pay-per-view Caged Death Match. But the teapot tempest does lead to an obvious question: Is disruption something that investors and traders ought to value when looking for opportunities?Ive observed the tech scene close up for 30 years. Ive seen more than one management fad burn bright, only to fade away when it turned out not to be different this time.To me, disruption is simply the latest in a long line of failed attempts to reduce business success to a small number of steps that are repeatable across time and space. Success is never certain. It is fraught with danger and dead ends, involves at least as much luck and circumstance as talent and hard work, and is rarely repeatable, even by the people who have already succeeded.The indefinite nature of the term disruptionallows it to be a painted pony. Disruption is whatever somebody with an agenda (or a funded business plan) wants it to be. Its a close cousin of Modern Art, a term that converts a relative construct to an absolute one.Are there disruptors among the stock holdings in my technology portfolio? Probably. Just looking through the 50 names we currently hold, I can see a few. EnerNOC practically /quotes/zigman/105251/delayed/quotes/nls/enoc ENOC -1.35% invented the energy-demand-response software segment, returning power (no pun intended) to energy-hungry businesses. And I suppose Shutterfly /quotes/zigman/101900/delayed/quotes/nls/sfly SFLY +2.39% re-invented the commercial-printing business through its self-serve model. Plus Facebook /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB +1.92% and some of our other Software-as-a-Service holdings are doing plenty of disrupting.But disruption isnt a requirement for us. Unlike, say, consistent cash flow and a management that has the basics down pat.Too often, it seems, you end up paying a premium for the disruption that isnt always rewarded over time. For example, if 3-D printing is so darned disruptive, where is the carnage? Physical model makers? Cmon, get real. 3-D Printing has essentially been around for 30 years. Important patents have already expired. Prices have dropped by several orders of magnitude. Yet, mostly 3-D printing has enabled things that hadnt previously been possible. All the manufacturers (with their warehouses of spare parts) that were going to be put under by just-in-time production? Still very much with us.Long-time shareholders of Stratasys /quotes/zigman/13021436/delayed/quotes/nls/ssys SSYS +1.33% and 3-D Systems /quotes/zigman/5280737/delayed/quotes/nls/ddd DDD +2.36% have done well. But owners of more recent disruptors like Voxeljet /quotes/zigman/22041185/delayed/quotes/nls/vjet VJET +5.63% , ExOne /quotes/zigman/13926498/delayed/quotes/nls/xone XONE +2.39% and Organovo /quotes/zigman/19344667/delayed/quotes/nls/onvo ONVO +2.73% ? Not so much.There are other pitfalls. Disruption sure gets a lot of validation when, for example, ride-sharing start-up Uber gets a $17 billion private equity valuation, despite not having been awarded a single patent. But that market largess can just as quickly disappear. Just look at cloud-storage vendor Box, suddenly scrambling for a lifeline in the absence of more P/E money or a path to an IPO .Never mind what happens when two or more companies are doing the disrupting ... side-by-side. How profitably can Zillow /quotes/zigman/5930210/delayed/quotes/nls/z Z -0.43% do any disrupting with Trulia /quotes/zigman/11860413/delayed/quotes/nls/trla TRLA +0.97% and a half a dozen others alongside, vying for the same ad dollars and broker partners?Lastly, how valuable is disruption if it doesnt evolve into dominance? We own several companies that are doing a fine job of disrupting, but thats not an end, only a means. We expect them to be top dog in a winner-take-all or winner-take-most market.The bottom line is this: Disruption is fine. But cash flow and competitive advantages are better insurance against having a news release or an ill-timed headline disrupt your trading or investing thesis.DISCLAIMER: The investments discussed are held in client accounts as of June 30, 2013.

Puerto Rico power debt extends fall after reserve draw	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Puerto Ricos power authority debt extended a sharp fall in price after bondholders were paid in part from a reserve fund last week. The authority, which goes by Prepa, was short $41.6 million in its debt payments, requiring the indenture trustee to draw on the reserve fund to pay bondholders, according to a disclosure released late Thursday. Thats one sign the authority may have to restructure following the passage of a law last month that provides a path for Puerto Ricos public corporations to overhaul their debt. Prepa bonds traded at 39 cents on the dollar on Friday, compared with 51 cents on the dollar on June 30, before the reserve draw. The bonds yielded nearly 18% on Friday, according to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. A spokesperson for Puerto Rico said in a statement: The most important fact about [Thursdays] disclosure is that PREPA made its bond payments as scheduled on July 1, 2014 -- payments totaling more than $417 million. Prepa has been the subject of credit rating downgrades in recent weeks as analysts speculate that the authority may have to restructure its debt. The cash-strapped authority made a deal this week with some of its revolving loan providers to delay certain payments until July 31.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=6526A5AD-0A17-41B5-B1A6-3B1609C94C6F&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

Credit growth makes economy go ’round, forecaster says	By Rex Nutting, MarketWatchWhy is he so optimistic? Because credit is growing again. Banks are more willing to lend, and companies and individuals are more willing to borrow. Credit makes the economy go ‘round.“The business cycle is largely a credit cycle,” says Harris, who is chief economist for the Americas at UBS, the giant Swiss investment bank.Harris and his team — economists Drew Matus, Samuel Coffin and Kevin Cummins — won the Forecaster of the Month contest for June, beating out 45 other forecasters. It’s the seventh time UBS and Harris have won the monthly contest sponsored by MarketWatch.Harris was the MarketWatch Forecaster of the Year in 2004, 2006 and 2008, sharing the honor all three times with his former colleague, Jim O’Sullivan. Over the past 12 months, Harris’s team has been the third most accurate forecasting team on the Street.Harris has been around long enough to remember the first rule about monetary policy: It works with long and variable lags. The Federal Reserve will soon end its purchases of bonds, but the impact of the Fed’s purchases has yet to be fully felt, he believes.The Fed has flooded the economy with lots of liquidity, but the economy wasn’t quite ready for it. Households were still paying down their debts, and businesses were cautious about expanding while consumers were constrained in their spending.Those conditions are gradually easing. Debts are being worked off, and consumers are beginning to take on more consumption-related debt again. There’s a lot of pent-up demand, especially for houses. The millennials won’t be living in Mom’s basement forever.That’s the demand side. The supply of credit is also slowly improving. Banks are easing their lending standards only gradually as they build up their capital and their animal spirits after the crushing losses of the Great Recession.Harris admits to being a congenital optimist. He lets his bullish views color his firm’s forecasts for the monthly data, but only up to a point. The great thing about working collaboratively in a team is that other members of the team provide a reality check to his optimism.If his enthusiasm goes too far, either Matus, Coffin or Cummins is sure to tell him kindly: “Boss, why don’t you be optimistic next month?”In the June contest, Harris and his team’s forecasts were the most accurate on three of the 10 indicators we track: industrial production, housing starts and the consumer price index. Their forecasts for the trade deficit and durable goods orders were among the most accurate of the 46 forecasters in the contest.In the June contest, the runners-up were MarketWatch chief economist Irwin Kellner, Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors, Spencer Staples of EconAlpha and Jim O’Sullivan of High Frequency Economics.The median forecasts that MarketWatch publishes in the economic calendar come from the projections of the 15 forecasters who have scored the highest in our contest over the past 12 months, as well as the forecasts of the most recent winner. See our economic calendar and consensus forecast.Over the past 12 months, the top forecasters are, in order: Jim O’Sullivan of High Frequency Economics, Stephen Stanley of Pierpont Securities, Maury Harris’s team at UBS, Brian Wesbury and Robert Stein of First Trust, Ted Wieseman of Morgan Stanley, Avery Shenfeld of CIBC, Paul Edelstein of IHS Global Insight, Spencer Staples of EconAlpha, Lewis Alexander of Nomura Securities, Michael Feroli of J.P. Morgan, Julia Coronado of BNP Paribas, Scott Anderson of Bank of the West, Stu Hoffman’s team at PNC Financial, Jan Hatzius’s team at Goldman Sachs, and — tied for 15th — Neal Soss’s team at Credit Suisse, and Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics.Also read these stories on MarketWatch:Middle class is drowning in debt, hobbling the economyPortuguese bank crisis is the tip of the iceberg	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7FB4C8AE-0906-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

Feds Plosser says policy should respond to better outlook	WASHINGTON (MarkeWatch) -- The Federal Reserve should consider hiking rates in response to the improving outlook, said Charles Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed, on Friday. We should not be keeping rates at zero until we meet all our objectives, Plosser said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. As the Fed gets closer to its goals, monetary policy ought to be reacting, he said. We are closer than a lot of people might think, he said. Waiting too long can be disruptive, he said. The Fed risks losing control of financial markets and having to raise rates faster and higher because we are so far behind that the markets get ahead of us, he said. Plosser, considered one the most hawkish Fed officials, is a voting member of the central banks policy committee this year.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=885CB73C-7496-4D3E-80C0-4A6DCB1F569F&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11
Most Americans say job-hopping is a bad career move	By Quentin Fottrell, MarketWatchSome 62% of people say changing jobs every few years is likely to be “damaging” to a person’s long-term career advancement, according to a survey of over 2,000 employed adults and 230 human resources managers. The survey, by market research group Harris Interactive, was carried out by recruitment company Spherion. This reluctance to move jobs is even higher than it was in the years immediately before and after the Great Recession. Only 47% of people in 2002 and 55% in 2009 said changing jobs every few years was damaging.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3C2F79B8-090A-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

Google: More than 70K right-to-be-forgotten requests	By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatchGoogle stressed it was trying to comply with a European court’s controversial order, even as it painted the controversial decision as illogical, even wrong.“The European Court found that people have the right to ask for information to be removed from search results that include their names if it is ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive,’” David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer, said in a blog post.That means a newspaper, like The Guardian in London “could have an article on its website about an individual that’s perfectly legal, but we might not legally be able to show links to it in our results when you search for that person’s name,” he added.“It’s a bit like saying the book can stay in the library, it just cannot be included in the library’s card catalogue,” Drummond said.Still, the Google executive said “we obviously respect the court’s authority and are doing our very best to comply quickly and responsibly.”The take-down requests Google has received since May cover 250,000 Web pages, and the company has “a team of people individually reviewing each application, in most cases with limited information and almost no context.”Some of the requests “highlight the difficult value judgments search engines and European society now face,” he added.They include former politicians asking posts critical of their policies to be removed from search results and “serious, violent criminals” who want articles about what they did to be removed.Professionals, like architects and teachers, have also demanded the removal of “bad reviews,” while others simply want to erase comments they wrote “and now regret,” he said.The process has become so complex that Google has at times made mistakes, Drummond said, acknowledging that “we incorrectly removed links to some articles last week” although these were later reinstated.The Guardian newspaper referred to that admission, saying Thursday that it was one of the first publications to be notified by Google that some of its content had been removed from the search giant’s results. Some of the articles were subsequently reinstated in search results, the paper said.Drummond also said Google was sympathetic to some requests, including one from a man “who asked that we not show a news article saying he had been questioned in connection with a crime,” since he was able to show that he was never charged. He also pointed to the case of woman “who requested that we remove news articles for her daughter’s name as she had been the victim of abuse.”“It’s a complex issue, with no easy answers,” he added. “So a robust debate is both welcome and necessary, as, on this issue at least, no search engine has an instant or perfect answer.”Poll: Is the bull market in its final stage?Alibaba may kick off IPO process by month’s end	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=BCFE08F8-090E-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

U.S. stocks will be ‘very disappointing’ for 10 years	By Mark Hulbert, MarketWatchWhile that doesn’t mean a bear market is imminent, there is a high probability that investment returns over the next decade will be below average, according to Yale University economics professor and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller.Investors shouldn’t expect that what has worked for them over the past five years will continue to work in the future.One way to gauge the market’s valuation is to compare it to past bull-market peaks. There have been 35 since 1900, according to Ned Davis Research, a quantitative-research firm.Five of these six valuation ratios show the market is more overvalued today than it was at between 82% and 89% of those peaks. They are:* The cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio championed by Shiller, calculated by dividing the S&P 500 by its average inflation-adjusted earnings per share over the past decade.* The dividend yield, which is the percentage of a company’s stock price represented by its total annual dividends.* The price/sales ratio, calculated by dividing a company’s stock price by its per-share sales.* The price/book ratio, calculated by dividing a company’s stock price by its per-share book value, an accounting measure of net worth.* The Q ratio, calculated by dividing a company’s market capitalization by the replacement cost of its assets.It is noteworthy that there is such agreement among these ratios even though each calculates the market’s valuation in a profoundly different way.The sixth data point — the traditional price/earnings ratio, which focuses on trailing or projected 12-month earnings — is the one that paints the least-bearish picture. Still, it shows the market to be more overvalued than it was at 69% of those past market peaks.Shiller argues that the P/E doesn’t have as good a forecasting record as his cyclically adjusted variant.Some investors are ignoring the warning signs from these valuation ratios, since the bull market has continued higher even though the measures have told much the same story for some time.Yet Shiller says that it is “hardly surprising” that the market has gone up over the past year despite an above-average cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio, since his research always has shown that it and other valuation ratios have poor forecasting power over periods as short as a year. It is his ratio’s ability to forecast 10-year returns that he finds noteworthy.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=72091E68-0919-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11
10 things your life insurance agent won’t say	By Daniel Goldstein, MarketWatchAmericans bought more than $1.7 trillion worth of individual life insurance coverage in 2012, according to the American Council of Life Insurers, a trade group. Overall, there was $11.2 trillion in individual life insurance policies in effect in 2012 , up from $9.3 trillion in 2002.But many people may be buying too much insurance, or buying the wrong kind. For one thing, 64% of policies are “whole life” or “endowment” policies, which combine a “death benefit” (which pays money to your survivors if you die) with some kind of savings or investment mechanism. Whole-life coverage is usually more expensive than term life, which provides only a death benefit, and some financial advisers view whole life as an inefficient way to build savings.Consumers have also been buying larger policies. The average face value of a policy in 2012 was $163,000, up 37% from a decade earlier—a faster increase than the rise in average salaries over the same period, according to the Social Security Administration.The insurance industry argues that, if anything, most Americans have too little insurance. About 30% of U.S. households have no life insurance at all, according to Limra, an industry-funded research group. “If everyone got the recommended coverage, the minimum face value held by Americans should be almost $60 trillion in 2013 and perhaps as high as $88 trillion, based on only labor compensation,” says Whit Cornman, a spokesman for the ACLI.What’s the right amount of life insurance to have? There’s no cookie-cutter answer. Financial advisers say it’s generally a good idea for family breadwinners to have a policy big enough to pay off their mortgage. After that, it’s a question of whether your survivors will need to replace your lost income for help in paying for daily living expenses, and for longer-term goals like college and retirement.See also: 8 things you need to know about Social Security.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=AA2B793C-0917-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

Treasurys mark best week since March	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR -0.71%  yield, which falls as prices rise, was down 2 basis points on the day at 2.516%, according to Tradeweb. The yield fell for its fifth consecutive session, marking an 11 basis point weekly drop. That’s the biggest fall since mid-March, according to FactSet.Treasury prices drifted higher Friday, despite an easing of fears related to Portugal’s largest bank, Banco Espirito Santo, which had sent global tremors through markets on Thursday. The news out of Portugal underscored a broader tone of economic weakness outside of the U.S. which has helped keep yields low.“I think the reason we’re still sitting [at 2.51% on the 10-year] is that the other parts of the world are not as stable as the U.S.,” said Todd Hedtke, vice president for investment management at Allianz Investment Management. “Portugal was for sure the headline piece of that, but if you look at some of the manufacturing numbers out of Europe, they weren’t as strong. The general sentiment beyond the U.S. is still questionable.”The rise in Treasury prices on Friday was attributed in part to reports of large overnight buyers out of Asia and geopolitical tensions. Investors have also been pushing back their expectations for the timing of the Federal Reserve’s first hike to key lending rates, reflecting a dovish tone from minutes of the central bank’s last meeting, released Wednesday. Investors who use futures contracts to bet on the path of the fed funds rate now expect the first rate hike to occur in July 2015, according to CME FedWatch.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR -0.74%  yield fell 2 basis points to 3.344% and the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR -0.66%  yield was down 1 basis point at 1.638%.Fed officials took differing views on inflation Friday. Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed Bank, said that inflation is likely to stay below the 2% target for a “few years,” in a television interview. Meanwhile, Charles Plosser, president of the Fed Bank of Philadelphia, said that inflation numbers, which show a drift higher, are not noise.Dennis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed, suggested that the Fed should hike rates in the second half of 2015.Wells Fargo’s cost-cutting program stalls6 big-bank stocks with the best prospects5 celebrity money mistakes we can all learn from	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7D01E636-0902-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

He breaks it into three reasons:Read the full piece here. Macke also has a new book out about pundits, which he co-wrote with Josh Brown of Reformed Broker fame.Wells Fargo reported earnings with mixed results this morning but the CEO’s comments on the economy and optimism for the future tell the real story, say analysts.“Our results also reflected strong credit quality driven by an improved economy, especially the housing market, and our continued risk discipline,” CEO John Stumpf said Friday in a statement.Analysts point to the bank’s strength in commercial loan growth and continued improvement in credit losses as positive for the economy.“That commercial loan growth was up suggests that business owners are willing to borrow money to expand their businesses and credit losses are down means that few consumers and businesses are delinquency on their loans,” said David Hilder, analyst at Drexel Hamilton. “So in that sense it’s the best of both worlds.”10_YearYour browser does not support iframes.Benchmark Treasury prices are set to mark their biggest weekly climb in four months on the back of a five-day rally.

How to prepare for the end of cheap money	By Anthony MirhaydariThat phrase, popularized by that 1990s tune “Closing Time” is attributed to Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger, who lived large as the son of a rich man and worked as a trusted advisor to emperor Nero. Having navigated the brutal politics of Rome, he retired on good terms to a plentiful country estate. Things were looking pretty good until, in the wake of a conspiracy against Nero, he was forced to commit suicide by cutting his veins and taking poison.Something similar, if much less dramatic, is about to happen to the stock market as the Federal Reserve, after years of nursing the financial markets with a steady drip of cheap money morphine, is about to pull out the needle. It’s anyone’s guess what happens after.It seems nearly everyone is still in denial that anything is about to change. Just look at the market action on Wednesday in the wake of the release of the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting minutes.In it, policymakers confirmed that the current “QE3” bond-buying program will end in October, that they are concerned about evidence of investor complacency in the market, and that the end of the year will be dominated by chatter over the pace, timing and form of policy tightening in 2015.Yet after an initial knee-jerk reaction lower, the market seemed to dismiss all of this as mere bluster. Stocks rebounded. Treasury bonds rebounded. The U.S. dollar cratered. Precious metals took flight. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tried desperately to retake the all-important 17,000 level, but failed.All are indications investors believe the Fed will drag its feet on ending its six-year-old run of near 0% interest rates despite indications is should’ve already done so (using a simple Taylor Rule analysis).The job market has already tightened, with the unemployment rate at 6.1% (just three-tenths away from full employment) and the job-openings rate increasing to 2007 levels. Inflation is also on the rise with the Consumer Price Index growing at a 2.1% annual rate with more expected as food, fuel, medical costs and shelter all go up in price.Moreover, the folks at the Bank for International Settlements, the central bank of central banks in Basel, Switzerland, recently warned in their annual report that the Fed and other central banks were increasing the risk of financial turmoil later by resisting the need to shock the markets out of the complacency that has resulted from years of cheap-money dependency.But now, to maintain its credibility, the Fed is being forced to acknowledge — despite its desires to keep the cheap money flowing — that the situation has shifted.Should inflation continue to rise and the unemployment rate continue to fall, as is widely expected, Fed chairman Janet Yellen will have little choice but to acknowledge it at the upcoming events, including an appearance in front of Congress next Tuesday, the release of the next Fed policy announcement July 30, and the annual Jackson Hole symposium in August. When that happens, investors will find it more and more difficult to ignore the inevitable: Money, either via higher inflation and/or via Fed policy tightening, is about to become more expensive.The stock market could shrug this off, as it has during all but one Fed tightening cycles since 1970. The exception was the aftermath of the June 1999 rate hike, which pricked the dot-com bubble and sent the S&P 500 down more than 15% over the next 21 months.We could very well see the Fed prick its latest, much larger, stock-market bubble, as a rise in bond yields (and a drop in bond prices) slams the brakes on the real driver of the higher share prices over the last few years: Debt-fueled corporate-buyback programs .Researchers at TrimTabs note that announced buybacks this quarter have slowed to levels not seen since early 2012 at a time when new shares are being issued at the fastest pace since last fall. Moreover, the Financial Times reported this week that, out of desperation, companies are increasingly using secured bank loans to fund buybacks — subordinating all its bondholders to benefit stockholders.The result is that corporate cash relative to debt has fallen to the lowest level in 15 years, making income statements more and more sensitive to the business cycle. With elevated debt levels and leveraged balance sheets, the next recession is going to result in a flood of corporate defaults. Think about that, as well as the specter of higher inflation, before you buy that AAA-rated corporate bond yielding just 4.2% on average — lows last seen in the early 1960s.For now, I continue to recommend investors maintain a focus on precious metals as an inflation-protection strategy. Examples include the leveraged ProShares Ultra Silver /quotes/zigman/28455773/delayed/quotes/nls/agq AGQ +0.35% , which is up more than 24% since I added it to my Edge Letter Sample Portfolio back on June 5. For individual stocks, candidates include NovaGold /quotes/zigman/19253/delayed/quotes/nls/ng NG -0.25% , which is up 22.6% since being added on June 5.Disclosure: Anthony has recommended AGQ and NG to his clients.Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge and Edge Pro investment advisory newsletters, as well as Mirhaydari Capital Management, a registered investment advisory firm .	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A0BAD61E-0925-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

Atlanta Fed Lockhart sees rate hike in second half 2015	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Atlanta Fed, said the central bank should hold short-term interest rates close to zero for another year. I am still in the camp...of expecting the conditions to come together in the second half of 2015 that make it appropriate at that time for lift-off, Lockhart said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. Lockhart said he wanted to see a few more monthly inflation readings before deciding whether rising prices pose a threat. I think the numbers we have seen may have some transient factors in them, Lockhart said, noting that he had seen some projections that gasoline prices may soften after Labor Day. I want to give it a few more months to watch the inflation numbers, he added. Lockhart is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee this year. But his views are important because he is seen as a centrist between the hawk and dove camps on the central bank.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=03648C22-5448-44BE-A684-7840E2C5703B&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

U.S. posts $70.5 billion June budget surplus	By Greg Robb, MarketWatchIncluding the June surplus, the budget deficit for the first nine months of the 2014 fiscal year totaled $366 billion, down 28% from the same period a year ago. That is the smallest year-to-date budget deficit since 2008.“A series of bills reducing outlays and increasing taxes, as well as improved economic growth have left deficits declining quite rapidly over the past few years,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. strategist at TD Securities.Total budget receipts are up 8% to $2.259 trillion for the fiscal year to date.Spending is only up 1% for the October-through-June period. The government’s fiscal year begins Oct. 1.The budget surplus in June was $46 billion less that the surplus in June 2013, when the government got a large onetime payment from Fannie Mae.Treasury said receipts, mainly taxes, rose 13% compared with the same month a year ago.Spending was $253 billion in June, $83 billion more than a year ago.The Congressional Budget Office estimates a fiscal 2014 deficit of $492 billion, which would be 2.8% of gross domestic product.The deficit fell to $680 billion in fiscal 2013, which was the first deficit of below $1 trillion of Barack Obama’s presidency. The deficit hit a record of $1.4 trillion in 2009.Spending levels are on autopilot for this year and next, thanks to a budget deal struck late last year by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray. House Republicans and President Barack Obama have offered budget proposals for fiscal 2015, but neither is expected to go anywhere as midterm elections approach in November.The CBO also warns that the era of low deficits wont last long. Between 2015 and 2024, deficits are expected to rise to about $1 trillion in 2022 if current laws dont change.More news on MarketWatchIs U.S. better off by ‘almost every measure’?

Finding a better way to index	By Kirk SpanoPaul Merriman recently covered reasons to fall in love with index funds in a recent column. His first reason to use index funds was you wont ever again have to deal with a pushy salesman or broker. While I guess this sounds great, it isnt completely true in many cases. A lot of the money that flowed into index funds was from financial professionals who moved their clients there.Why would financial professionals move toward index funds — primarily in ETFs? The simple reason is that it is the trendy sale suddenly after all this time of selling loaded mutual funds that underperformed. A case of if you cant beat em, then join em if there ever was one. Beware, though, how most financial representatives sell their index-based strategies. It might not be the pushy sales approach that Merriman dislikes, but very well could be brokers in new uniforms regurgitating how they now have a fiduciary responsibility to you and indexing is the way to deliver. Thats at least interesting to me since a lot of the ones Ive known never cared much for fiduciary responsibility when they could make big commissions selling products.Regardless of the sales-driven financial industrys inconsistencies, heres where indexing breaks down. Indexing relies on a very long time frame and takes as much risk as the markets it is invested in. The risk associated with indexing is very underestimated by most people. By definition, you are taking 100% of the risk of the markets you are invested in. In big market downturns, you will suffer. Think about 2008 when virtually everything fell. If that happens to occur again shortly before you plan to retire, or worse, after you have retired, you are in a major bind since withdrawals for income will make it very difficult to fully recover your asset values.For indexers (I index a portion of client money) methodology is vitally important. Most financial advisers practice something called Modern Portfolio Theory, or something close to it. Modern Portfolio Theory using indexes is just another failed strategy that relies on backward-looking return data, though it isnt as failed as MPT using managed mutual funds.A better approach to indexing involves incorporating two ideas into your asset allocation. The first is hedging when markets are rising but becoming dangerous based on mathematical indicators.Here is an example. In the middle of June, I could tell mathematically that the stock market was becoming stretched again and that upward momentum was slowing. The market hadnt actually turned over, however, thus, I didnt want to sell my long holdings, in particular my S&P 500 ETF /quotes/zigman/714403/delayed/quotes/nls/spy SPY +0.08% , which is a regular holding. Instead, I bought some out-of-the-money puts on SPY which would protect me from any large and quick declines in the S&P 500 index.Explaining the math involved in quantitative analysis here would be difficult for me and painful to most, but try to envision this: Imagine a roller coaster and how it slows as it nears the peak of a rise. You cant see over that rise to know if there is a huge plunge or just some dips and turns before the next rise. But you pull on your seat harness anyway to make sure it is locked. That is your hedge.With a stock market index, buying some puts as you enter a slow high point in the market is your hedge. Quite often, as it was in this case, because the broad stock market was going up with low volatility, the puts were cheap, so hedging cost very little and added a lot of safety, all without having to sell core assets.The second thing to consider doing is to quickly sell some or all of your long holdings, once there is a mathematically confirmed downturn in the stock market. This is different from what most people do in trying to predict or time the market. It is simply reaction speed. With this approach, we are simply reacting quicker than the crowd when markets are in the early stages of a downturn. In essence, all we are doing is beating other investors to the exit. By doing this, we get out at higher prices. The reentry happens when the downturn slows and starts to turn back up - this is actually the easier of the two trades.Quantitative analysis is imperfect of course. Using it for short-term trading, like other methods, is almost useless. Im not a short-term trader because of that fact. What I have found it to be most useful for is hedging and position trading. These slow-handed methods have made a lot of difference in the risk levels and ultimate returns for my investors. There is even a simplified way to add quantitative measurement to stock trading so long as you pick out a very good small universe of stocks to work with as I appear to have done recently.If you can do, or you can hire somebody at the lower-end of the expense structure to use, these two strategies, then you have as big a leg up on indexers as they do on most active mutual fund managers. You will also have a leg up on the most important benchmark, not losing a lot of money during a bad market that could ruin your lifestyle in retirement.Disclosure: Kirk and certain clients of Bluemound Asset Management own SPY shares and are long puts on SPY.

Oil sinks below $101; fourth week of losses	By Myra P. Saefong and William L. Watts, MarketWatchWest Texas intermediate crude for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -2.18%  fell $2.10, or 2%, to settle at $100.83 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a day after breaking a nine-day losing streak. Based on the most-active contracts, prices hadn’t closed below $101 since May 12. They ended roughly 3.1% lower for the week.August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -2.02%  fell $2.01, or 1.9%, to $106.66 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange, with the contract losing more than 3.5% for the week.The International Energy Agency on Friday said Iraqi production fell by 260,000 barrels a day in the past month after violence in the north of the country, but increased supply from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria and Angola offset the decline to leave OPEC production broadly steady at 30 million barrels a day in June.The report is likely “providing confirmation of traders’ beliefs that the market isn’t as tight as they previously feared, but no more than that,” Matt Parry, senior oil analyst at the Paris-based IEA told MarketWatch in an email.Taking a look at 2015, non-OPEC supply growth is forecast to underperform demand for the first time in three years, “potentially keeping the market relatively well balanced,” he said. “Of course, that depends upon geopolitical issues which have been unusually heightened in recent times.”Oil futures rallied to nine-month highs in June as the fighting erupted, but have subsequently retreated on expectations Iraq’s main oil production and export facilities in the south of the country will remain insulated from the violence.Also on Nymex Friday, August gasoline /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 -1.66%  fell 5 cents to end at $2.91 a gallon, for a weekly loss of around 3.7%, while August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821453/delayed HOQ4 -0.35% fell 3 cents to $2.86 a gallon — 2.3% lower on the week.August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 +0.56%  settled at $4.15 per million British thermal unit, up almost 3 cents, but losing a hefty 5.9% for the week.Gold stock rally ‘foreshadows a trend’ for the metalIEA: Little room for complacency in oil markets5 things to know about Banco Espirito Santo and Europe	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3C45C78E-08F8-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

White House sees stronger jobs outlook	By Damian PalettaThe new estimate came in the White House budget office’s “Mid-Session Review,” which updates the economic and budget projections it made in the spring. The White House attributed the improving labor market to its belief that “as labor-market conditions improve, discouraged workers are expected to rejoin the labor force.”Big job growth in June pushed the unemployment rate down to 6.1%. The White House in March estimated the jobless rate would fall very slowly, only reaching 6.7% at the end of 2014. Its new estimate forecasts the jobless rate will hit 6.0% at the end of 2014 and 5.6% at the end of 2015, eventually settling at 5.4% in 2017.The Congressional Budget Office in February forecast the jobless rate would be 6.7% at the end of 2014 and 5.8% at the end of 2017.The recent drop in the unemployment rate occurred even as the White House has scaled back its expectations for economic growth. It predicted U.S. gross domestic product from the end of 2013 to the end of 2014 would grow just 2.6%, much less than the 3.3% estimate it offered in March. That estimate is still stronger than many private forecasters expect for the full year.The White House said GDP would grow an average 3.3% in 2015 and 2016 before falling to 2.6% in 2017.The White House didn’t change its estimate for inflation, saying the overall consumer-price index inflation rate “is projected to be 2.3% per year” over the long run.The White House also projected tax revenue from 2015 through 2024 would come in $760 billion less than it forecast in March. It attributed most of that change to revisions in its economic forecasts, which include the slower growth rates in 2014 and 2017.More news on MarketWatch:Cooler weather on the way but please don’t call it a ‘polar vortex’2,000 days of Obama: How have stocks done	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=33FAC388-0937-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-11

Want financial freedom? Get your living expenses under control	By Jonathan ClementsI used to think that quote was simply about the virtue of living within your means. Depending on your income relative to your expenses, your wealth would either grow or shrink.But now, the quote strikes me as a commentary not just on financial happiness and misery, but on overall happiness and misery. If you’re locked into an expensive lifestyle, you won’t just suffer financial stress. You may also find it tough to lead the life you want.What is wealth? To me, it isn’t a particular sum of money. Rather, it’s the freedom to spend your days doing what you’re passionate about and what you think is important.Love your job and earn enough to cover your living expenses? Even if you don’t have much money in the bank, you should consider yourself rich, because you get to spend your days doing what you enjoy.Many folks, alas, aren’t fond of their job. They may have been excited when they started. But a handful of years down the road, the bloom may be off the rose, which is why changing jobs can—at least for a while—bolster happiness.Eventually, however, you might decide you want to do something completely different. That freedom comes at retirement. If you no longer need a paycheck, you have the financial leeway to pursue hobbies, devote more time to your religion, help your favorite charity, head back to college or whatever else takes your fancy. Problem is, you likely won’t have enough money to retire until your 60s. That may be an awfully long time to wait.What if you want to change now, and taking another job at your current employer, or a similar position elsewhere, simply doesn’t excite you? It might be time to switch careers, even if that involves a pay cut.Let’s say you want to quit your financially rewarding, but hardly enriching, corporate job to become a schoolteacher, which you think will be more fulfilling. To make the career change, you’ll either need a heap of savings or a low cost of living, and probably both.The benefits of a fat portfolio are obvious. If you had saved diligently for retirement and other goals when you were in the corporate world, you might have less need to save once you take the teaching job. You could even use some of your savings to supplement your lower income.The benefits of a low cost of living are, I suspect, less appreciated. That brings us back to the wisdom of Mr. Micawber. If your cost of living is high, you may have no choice but to keep slogging away at the corporate job you hate.But if your costs are low, you’ll find it easier to save money, you’ll be in better shape if you get laid off, you’ll need a smaller nest egg to retire in comfort—and you may have the financial freedom to take a lower-paying job.

More amusement park rides end at hospital	By Priya Anand, MarketWatchThe estimated number of U.S. emergency room visits for amusement ride-related injuries reached 27,054 last year, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. That’s down from 2012, when that figure jumped to more than 30,000, but follows steady increases over the last decade. The incidents may be just a small fraction of the nearly 300 million people who take about 1.7 billion safe rides at 400 U.S. amusement parks annually, according to estimates by the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, but the increases in injuries and inconsistencies in safety guidelines have become a concern.Four people were hurt in the Monday accident at Magic Mountain, and two others were taken to the hospital as a precaution, according to media reports. Mobile rides — like those at traveling carnivals — fall under the purview of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. But there are no national safety standards for fixed amusement park rides, which are regulated by hodgepodge state and local laws. What that means for riders: You could hop onto a machine that’s annually inspected by a state official in New Jersey, where rides are also subject to random inspection throughout the season. But in Alabama — where there’s no state oversight over the few amusement parks — good luck.“There are huge inconsistencies in state regulation,” says Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and senior counsel at the Consumer Federation of America, where she handles product-safety issues. “There really is very little indication of whether a ride could pose risk. Consumers don’t think they’re going to be severely injured or tragically killed at a park.”Alabama is one of six states that don’t regulate amusement rides, according to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, joined by Mississippi, Nevada, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Utah.Last year, Six Flags /quotes/zigman/597013/delayed/quotes/nls/six SIX +0.41%  Over Texas initiated an investigation into the death of a woman on one if its own roller coasters, NBC News reported, because the state doesn’t take responsibility for inspections.While he was in the House of Representatives, Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts ,introduced multiple bills to regulate amusement rides, most recently in 2011. None passed.“CPSC stands ready for any regulation approved by Congress,” Nychelle Fleming, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission told MarketWatch when asked if the agency supports broadening its jurisdiction to include stationary amusement rides. The agency also said people can contact their state authorities and speak with park management to learn more about safety practices at the parks they visit.In Wyoming, where there are no major theme parks, it might make sense that there’s no state oversight program, says Laura Woodburn, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Amusement Ride Safety Officials, a nonprofit of local agencies, insurance companies, consultants, federal agencies and amusement safety officials. The group offers education and certification programs in the field, and Woodburn said it would “not judge the states in how they choose to run their programs.”She said park-goers should watch ride operators to make sure they are paying attention, and that their family and friends are following ride instructions, like height requirements.Action Park in New Jersey reopened last month, after closing in 1996. Under its old name, Mountain Creek Waterpark, it had developed a reputation as the park to visit for injuries, not fun. The park was home to 103 of the 552 serious injuries at the state’s amusement parks — accounting for about 20% of the accidents across 15 parks, according to state data obtained by NJ.com.While people can search for inspection stickers on rides and make sure they follow operating directions by keeping their hands inside and fastening belts, it would be difficult for visitors to figure out how much each device has been tested and when, given the varying state laws.“People think they’re assuming some risk, but I think they don’t realize how much risk they actually are assuming when they choose to go to amusement parks,” Weintraub says.More from MarketWatch:5 celebrity money mistakes we can all learn fromMurderer turned stock-picker is ‘Oracle of San Quentin’Social Security loophole’s windfall opportunity	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9EE75CCA-0904-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-12
10 things life insurance agents won’t say	By Daniel Goldstein, MarketWatchAmericans bought more than $1.7 trillion worth of individual life insurance coverage in 2012, according to the American Council of Life Insurers, a trade group. Overall, there was $11.2 trillion in individual life insurance policies in effect in 2012 , up from $9.3 trillion in 2002.But many people may be buying too much insurance, or buying the wrong kind. For one thing, 64% of policies are “whole life” or “endowment” policies, which combine a “death benefit” (which pays money to your survivors if you die) with some kind of savings or investment mechanism. Whole-life coverage is usually more expensive than term life, which provides only a death benefit, and some financial advisers view whole life as an inefficient way to build savings.Consumers have also been buying larger policies. The average face value of a policy in 2012 was $163,000, up 37% from a decade earlier—a faster increase than the rise in average salaries over the same period, according to the Social Security Administration.The insurance industry argues that, if anything, most Americans have too little insurance. About 30% of U.S. households have no life insurance at all, according to Limra, an industry-funded research group. “If everyone got the recommended coverage, the minimum face value held by Americans should be almost $60 trillion in 2013 and perhaps as high as $88 trillion, based on only labor compensation,” says Whit Cornman, a spokesman for the ACLI.What’s the right amount of life insurance to have? There’s no cookie-cutter answer. Financial advisers say it’s generally a good idea for family breadwinners to have a policy big enough to pay off their mortgage. After that, it’s a question of whether your survivors will need to replace your lost income for help in paying for daily living expenses, and for longer-term goals like college and retirement.See also: 8 things you need to know about Social Security.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=AA2B793C-0917-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-12

A Scotch to drink on the golf course	By Charles Passy, MarketWatchThe back story: Glenmorangie is one of the better known names in single-malt Scotches, one whose reputation has grown considerably in recent years as an easy-to-appreciate, quality sip. The brand, part of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA luxury goods conglomerate, has seen U.S. sales increase by nearly 160% in the past five years, according to The Beverage Information & Insights Group.But sales figures aside, there are two back stories of late to consider involving Glenmorangie, a whisky with roots going back to 1843. The first involves a certain Scottish pastime called golf — yes, the sport of “ Caddyshack ” and Tiger Woods fame apparently got its start in Scotland during the Middle Ages. But in spite of that fact, Scotch whisky producers have been hesitant to connect spirit and sport together as a heritage play. “That tartan school of marketing seemed a bit too parochial to the industry,” says Glenmorangie brand ambassador David Blackmore. That is, until now. Glenmorangie has made what’s seemingly at least a six-figure promotional commitment to the sport: The brand is a sponsor of the British Open, which kicks off July 13 in Liverpool. And it’s also signed on former top-ranked golfer Sir Nick Faldo as a brand spokesman. (Apparently, Faldo was such a Glenmorangie fan, he actually reached out to the brand first. “It’s always been my wee tipple,” he said at a recent Glenmorangie New York press event.)As for Signet, that’s got a back story all its own. Unlike a lot of higher-priced whisky releases, this one is not about age — indeed, Glenmorangie won’t put an age statement on the bottle, though the brand says some 30- to 40-year-old whiskies are part of the mix (don’t be confused by the term “single malt” — even single malts can be blends of whiskies, so long as all the whiskies in the bottle come from the same distillery). The key to Signet, however, is that it contains a small percentage of a whisky made with a tumble-roasted barley (as opposed to the traditional table-dried barley) — in other words, a barley that’s been prepared much the same way as coffee and cocoa beans are. The idea is that the “roasted” flavor should come through as you sip the whisky.What we think about it: It’s pretty easy to see why Signet, which was introduced in 2009, has quickly become something of a cult whisky. It’s really unlike almost any other Scotch on the market. The flavor is not smoky a la the classic whiskies from Scotland’s Islay region (Glenmorangie is a Highlands whisky). At the same time, it does have those roasting notes — with more than a strong hint of chocolate in every sip (and maybe a hint of coffee, too). Does that make Signet a “great” whisky? Perhaps not. But it certainly makes it a profoundly interesting one.How to enjoy it: Try this one neat to appreciate its signature flavor. It also pairs well with a rich chocolate dessert — just like coffee. And if you happen to be a fan of cigars, brand ambassador David Blackmore says the roasted notes make it a natural to enjoy with a stogie. Of course, if Signet’s flavor is too unique for you, you can always opt for one of the classic Glenmorangie releases. Sir Nick Faldo’s pick? “I go straight for the 18-year-old,” he said.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=98F9BA68-0857-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-13

Iraq security crisis worsens	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Iraqs newly elected legislature failed to agree on a new parliament speaker during its second seating on Sunday, further extending a political impasse that has dashed hopes of reaching a political resolution to the worst security crisis to afflict the country since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, The Wall Street Journal reported. Parliamentarians met briefly on Sunday morning but adjourned almost immediately after Mehdi Hafez, the legislatures interim speaker, announced that deputies hadnt yet reached an agreement on a new speaker, according to the report. U.S. diplomats and other international observers have urged Iraqi politicians to reach a hasty agreement over the parliament speaker, the president and the prime minister--the so-called presidencies who are traditionally split between Sunni Arabs, Kurds and Shiite Arabs, The Joural said. The political deadlock has raised concerns among Iraqi politicians and international observers that Iraqs political class is busy bickering even as its country is riven apart by a powerful Islamist insurgency. The primary barrier to forming a new government is the widespread opposition to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who has refused to step down, The Journal said.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=161C120D-3BD6-461C-8736-3A5143FCCF83&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-13

Economy needs consumers to chip in	By Jeffry Bartash, MarketWatchAnd that’s a problem.Consumer spending is the fuel that runs a modern economy. Oh sure, businesses have to invest and hire to get the party going, but consumer spending generates more than two-thirds of the nation’s economic activity. When they spend more, businesses hire and invest more.Yet since the recession ended in mid-2009, consumers have been unusually shy. Americans are only spending about two-thirds as much as they used to and that’s kept U.S. growth well below its historical norm. Meager wage gains, a devastated labor market and deep scars from the Great Recession clearly played a part in suppressing the urge or ability to spend.As of May consumer spending is climbing at just a 2.9% annual pace, the slowest rate in five years. And a key bellwether of whether Americans are spending more, retail sales, hasn’t show much pop.“For the economy to really kick into the next gear, we need the consumer to do more of the heavy lifting,” said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody’s Analytics. “For many consumers it still feels like a recession.”The retail sales report for June, released Tuesday, could offer further clues on whether consumers are starting to feel more optimistic. Economists predict sales will rise by a healthy 0.6%, but more important is whether other sectors aside from fast-growing auto and Internet retailers show renewed strength. Many of them have lagged behind in 2014.Also on the docket this week are reports on new home construction, manufacturing and consumer sentiment.Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will also field questions from Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday and probably find herself under scrutiny from both the political right and left just months before a critical midterm election. Conservatives want the Fed to intervene in the economy less, liberals want the central bank to do more to boost growth and reduce inequality.“The Fed is a real convenient punching bag,” said Paul Edelstein, director of financial economics at IHS Global Insight.The U.S. retail industry is a tale of two halves. Some retailers, mainly those that sell cars or goods over the Internet, are posting strong growth. Car sales in June, for example, hit an eight-year high as more Americans take advantage of good deals and low interest rates to replace aging vehicles.Other retailers have experienced flat or even declining sales, such as stores that sell men’s clothes or hobby items.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=97E15A3C-0915-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-13

Hong Kong’s ‘small flat’ rebound	By Craig StephenAsia’s richest tycoon, Li Ka-shing, has said he’s having sleepless nights worrying about Hong Kong’s troubles. Yet he should be sleeping like a baby if he checks the share price of his flagship developer Cheung Kong Holdings /quotes/zigman/13969/delayed HK:0001 -0.28%   /quotes/zigman/157633/delayed/quotes/nls/cheuy CHEUY -0.22% — last week, it broke through resistance to make four-year highs.For now, it appears the market is prepared to shrug off doomsday warnings over Occupy Central protests. The latest came from HSBC last week, which downgraded Hong Kong after flagging the risks to the stock market from the civil-disobedience movement.If Cheung Kong’s share price is any guide, however, Occupy Central is just background noise. If you really want to take the pulse of Hong Kong, it is the property market that matters.And that market is now showing signs of a revival, helped by a new strategy by developers to counter the stretched incomes of locals: Just make the apartments smaller.Of course, residential flats have been getting smaller in Hong Kong for some years. But now, Mr. Li’s Cheung Kong is breaking new ground by making them truly tiny.The latest batch of apartments in Hong Kong’s New Territories district come in at less than 200 square feet. The smallest are just 177 square feet with 97-square-foot living rooms, 13-square-foot kitchens and 31-square-foot bathrooms. The flats are expected to sell for about 2 million Hong Kong dollars (about $260,000).Analysts back Cheung Kong’s strategy to go small. J.P. Morgan writes that Cheung Kong will be a relative winner, driven by its mass-market focus and high-asset-turnover strategy. An 11-million-square-foot land bank should stretch further if it can slice and dice apartments down to 200 square feet apiece.The “small flat” turnaround can be seen in secondary-market transactions. Some 395-square-foot flats in the suburb of Shatin have reportedly been changing hands at HK$13,000 a square foot.J.P. Morgan has also revised its outlook for Hong Kong property, replacing a forecast for a 25%-30% fall in property prices this year to a downside risk of a drop of just 5% or less. The lasting impression is that various government measures introduced to cool the market over the past 12 months have had little impact.But any sign that housing inflation is again accelerating is likely to prove controversial.It has been said in the past that for an investor-driven property market like Hong Kong’s, apartments are just boxes to hold money, given that they are often left unoccupied. Perhaps we are now just taking this to a new extreme, where apartments have barely enough space for people.Although Li’s small-housing-unit strategy appears to impress analysts and investors, it is unlikely to play well with a restive public, alarmed at unaffordable property.Already the media is comparing Li’s new properties to prison cells. The South China Morning Post helpfully calculated they are just over twice the size of a single-person cell at the city’s Stanley Prison. Of course, this will not include free meals.The problem for Hong Kong is just how many people might find themselves facing a cell-like apartment. A partner at an international law firm recently complained to me that even his new lawyers — who were in the top 5% of earners — could not afford to buy a home in Hong Kong.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0F085D2C-0AF6-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-13

U.S. stocks: Futures climb; Citigroup results in view	By Carla Mozee, MarketWatchFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/21524673/delayed DJU4 +0.18%  rose 60 points, or 0.4%, to 16,941, while those for the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/11777331/delayed SPU4 +0.34%  picked up 7 points, or 0.4%, to 1,969.30. The Nasdaq 100 index /quotes/zigman/17563580/delayed NDU4 +0.47%  was up 19 points, or 0.5%, to 3,916.The pace of the second-quarter earnings season will rev higher this week with results due from key names in the financial and technology sectors, the two largest sectors in the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.15% .  The banking sector and “valuations are going to remain the main focus for this week, as we will get the earnings from some of the biggest tycoons of Wall Street,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in a note. “The expectations are high, and investors are hoping that these earnings will cement the optimism that growth is on track in the U.S. and the revenues are healthy.”Before the bell on Monday, Citigroup /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C +0.21% is expected to post second-quarter earnings of $1.05 a share, according to a consensus survey by FactSet. That compares with earnings of $1.25 a share in the same period a year ago. Revenue is likely to decline to $18.91 billion from $20.48 billion a year ago, hurt by a slump in fixed-income trading.Also expected Monday is an announcement from Citigroup that it has reached a $7 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, The Wall Street Journal reported. The deal would end an investigation into whether the bank defrauded investors on mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis.There are no Federal Reserve speakers or data reports on the calendar Monday, though Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen will field questions from Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Bicycle vacations: boomers’ latest travel trend	A recent travel segment on Sky News went so far as to dub bicycling vacations “the new golf.”Touring by bicycle is easier on aging joints than jogging, lets riders cover greater distances than walking and allows for a more intimate, up-close experience than riding in cars, buses or trains.This environmentally-friendly mode of transport can offset vacation weight gain with healthy exercise and its broad appeal extends to solo travelers, couples, friends and multigenerational groups.By definition, the term “bicycle tourism” refers to noncompetitive cycling trips, ranging from daylong city tours to multiday explorations along a route. Experienced cyclists may travel independently on self-guided tours, but most boomers opt for organized ones designed to meet their interests and skill levels. Devotees often feel as passionately about the biking experience as they do about the destinations they visit.Because choosing among the many thousands of tours can be confusing, Next Avenue asked experts to answer questions that first-timers might have about planning a bicycle vacation. Here is what they said:How do I figure out where to go and select an itinerary?Your choice will depend on a host of factors: How much time you have, when you want to go, how much money you want to spend and what you want to experience and see.Some tourists opt to visit destinations already on their bucket lists; others are driven by special interests (such as learning about the foods or wines of Italy.) For some, overnight stays in castles or châteaux with gourmet meals can be a big draw; others want to visit iconic sites or trace their family roots.Experts stress the importance of thorough research. Bicycle tours vary in terms of group size; trip intensity (both the pace and the number of miles pedaled each day) and the number, length and types of breaks taken each day. Accommodations range from tents to luxury stays in five-star properties. Terrain (flat vs. hilly or rocky; paved vs. gravel or cobblestone), climate and time of year are also important considerations in selecting a tour.“Especially with folks over 50, whose joints may be feeling a bit of wear and tear, the last thing they should do is go way above their heads in terms of physical fitness level,” says Dave Aidekman, founder of The Trip Tribe, a company that curates group trips. “At the end of the day, the majority of these travelers aren’t looking for a workout; they want to see an area from an on-the-ground view with breaks in between for activities outside of biking,” he adds.How fit do I need to be to go on a bicycle tour?If you can ride a stationary or outdoor bike or participate in a spinning class for at least an hour, you are probably up to the rigors of a beginning bicycle tour.“Similar to starting any new physical activity, like jogging or Zumba, make sure you’ve had a physical within the past year and ask your doctor whether you are fit for this type of exercise,” suggests Dr. Robert A. Wolfson, an internist with the Mount Kisco Medical Group in New York.Since there are different levels of cycling, tour companies generally assess your level of experience to determine whether you belong in a strong (25 to 60 miles a day), moderate (20 to 40 miles a day) or light (15 to 35 miles a day) activity group. Extremes in climate and altitude can exacerbate the difficulty of any tour.“Be honest about what you can currently do versus what you used to be able to do,” says Loren Siekman of Pure Adventures, a self-guided tour company.For peace of mind, Seth Heald, president of Arizona Outback Adventures, recommends inquiring about cellphone coverage in the areas where you will be traveling and finding out about access to emergency care.Will I be able to keep up with the group?Bicycle tours are largely self-paced and flexible: You can stop whenever you’re tired, pause to take photographs or choose to skip a morning or afternoon ride and catch up with the group at the next stop.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=38331D80-06EC-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

How to avoid another Malaysia Flight 370	By Andy PasztorFacing a groundswell of public concern, airlines and government safety experts want to change the way aircraft will be routinely tracked, and how emergency searches will be conducted in the future. But as they have done in the past, industry leaders are gearing up to oppose other changes they contend are unnecessary and overly expensive.“Something this rare and this unpredictable” requires dramatic action, according to Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, council president of the International Civil Aviation Organization, the air-safety arm of the United Nations. “Industry is absolutely in solidarity,” says Nancy Graham, ICAO’s top safety staffer, “because there is this nervousness” about Flight 370.Carriers, equipment makers and communication-service providers are moving to voluntarily ensure that the more than 120,000 airline flights worldwide each day — including those on polar or long overwater routes lacking traditional radar coverage — will report their position at least every few minutes. The airline industry’s top trade association, the International Air Transport Association, announced that unequivocal goal in April — more than a month before it had drafted any specifics or officially appointed all the members of a high-level advisory group.Airlines are responding to public outrage and disbelief that despite today’s digitally-connected world, a nearly 250-ton-airliner could simply vanish without a trace. Flight 370 is bound to be “a shadow over us for a while,” according to Tony Tyler, executive director of the IATA. “We cannot let another aircraft simply disappear.”Recommendations for changes, including enhanced satellite connections, are expected as soon as the fall. That is an unprecedented timetable because getting consensus for such sweeping efforts typically takes years instead of months. Everyone is “moving as fast as we possibly can,” said Graham.An extended version of this article appears at WSJ.com.More from MarketWatch:Avoid a U.S. stock market meltdown and go globalOil, SolarCity tapped as two long plays in this sketchy stock marketEuro-zone industrial outputs slumps in May	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B440B9AC-0B40-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

This is the sneakiest thing stores do to trick consumers	By Catey Hill, MarketWatchMany of the stores that offer the most frequent coupons and discounts also tailor the asking prices of items so that even coupons and sales don’t mean real savings. For example, as of July 11, frequent discounter J.C. Penney /quotes/zigman/237947/delayed/quotes/nls/jcp JCP +0.11%   advertises that the “original price” of its Ninja NJ600 Blender is $145.00 and that it’s now on sale for $99.00. Meanwhile, at Target /quotes/zigman/253872/delayed/quotes/nls/tgt TGT +0.12%  , Bed Bath & Beyond /quotes/zigman/68991/delayed/quotes/nls/bbby BBBY +2.19%   and Best Buy /quotes/zigman/219712/delayed/quotes/nls/bby BBY -1.97%  , that blender is listed at and selling for $99.99 and at Amazon /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN +5.57%   it’s listed at $109.99 and selling for $96.35. “Shoppers are usually attracted to the magnitude of the sale — 30% off always looks better than 15% off — but retailers can fairly easily increase the list price of an item to make the discount appear deeper,” says Matthew Ong, a retail analyst with NerdWallet.com .“Original prices, as well as sale prices, are set individually by each retailer’s merchant team based on their customer base, sales events, promotional calendar, etc, therefore prices will vary retailer to retailer,” A J.C. Penney spokeswoman told MarketWatch.Kohl’s /quotes/zigman/231595/delayed/quotes/nls/kss KSS -1.08%  , which “almost always” has a coupon code available, according to data from DealScience.com, does it slightly differently. They sell the KitchenAid Artisan Five-Quart Stand Mixer for $449.99, which is typically $100 or more higher than competitors. The KitchenAid website — as well as Target.com and HomeDepot.com — sell it for $349.99. “Consumers would have to have a coupon of $100 off, or 22% off, at Kohl’s to even get the Stand Mixer for the same price as the base price at multiple other stores,” says Ong. “Even with a great coupon or deal from Kohl’s, the consumer still may not beat out what he or she could have gotten with a smaller value coupon at a different store.”As of press time, Kohl’s had not yet responded to a request for comment. And it’s not just Kohl’s and J. C. Penney that are employing various tricky pricing tactics: MarketWatch found evidence of this at other major chain stores as well.So why are stores employing these tricky pricing tactics? These discounts and coupons drive store traffic, but the stores can’t afford to always sell their items at a true discount, explains Greg Smith, the chief creative officer at The VIA Agency, which counts a number of large consumer brands among its clients. So instead, they sometimes manipulate the prices of the items so they can offer a “discount” but not lose too much money by doing so. “The places that do this the most, coupon [and offer deals] the most,” says Smith.Of course, there are still deals to be had at these places: Plenty of times, the original price is legitimate or the coupon or promotion will actually offer a true discount. And sometimes convenience trumps all. When you’re already in a store and need an item immediately, it may be worth it to you to pay a little more. Furthermore, there are some indications that consumers like couponing and price changes: When former J.C. Penney CEO Ron Johnson decided to cut back on coupons and promotions , among other pricing moves, sales tanked .Still, this price manipulation means that consumers need to be savvy when they’re shopping, says Ong. He recommends that shoppers check the price of the item they want in multiple locations, including Amazon, a big-box store or two like Wal-Mart /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed/quotes/nls/wmt WMT -0.31%   or Target and a couple of stores where they regularly shop. Andrea Woroch, a consumer savings expert at Kinoli , says that she likes sites like PriceGrabber, TheFind and Google Shopping for price comparisons (be sure to compare shipping rates as well — FreeShipping.org is good for that) and if you’re in the store, she says that price comparison apps like RedLaser or Snaptell are best. (Ong cautions, however, that you can’t just rely on one price comparison site, as they’re often not comprehensive.)Try to combine those offers with coupons (Woroch likes CouponSherpa.com and Coupons.com, both of which have apps) to find the truly lowest price. Be sure to clear your cookies when you’re price-searching as retailers sometimes lure new shoppers with low initial prices, but if you come back the price may have changed, she adds.If you don’t need the item right then and there, there are other ways to save. Woroch likes the Hukkster browser add-in, which sends you alerts when specific items go on sale or a coupon becomes available, and adds that you may want to consider naming your own price on an item at Greentoe.com (if it’s available there). She also says you should know when to buy items: Summer clothing and accessories are often on sale now as retailers try to make room for fall items, for example.Finally, if you do realize that you’ve overpaid, all may not be lost. Some stores — like Banana Republic and Gap /quotes/zigman/227242/delayed/quotes/nls/gps GPS -0.78%   — will do a one-time price adjustment if you see the item you bought on sale within two weeks of purchase.More from MarketWatch:Here’s a thrill: Your roller coaster might not have been inspectedWhat a murderer can teach you about picking stocks6 affordable, educational apps for kids	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=196C6F3C-092B-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14
Avoid a U.S. stock market meltdown and go global	By Jeff Reeves, MarketWatchAt the same time, European equities had a shock as the solvency of a major Portuguese bank was called into question. Shades of the 2011 European debt crisis spooked investors, and stocks across Europe slid.With trouble in developed markets and yields on interest-bearing assets still paltry — and perhaps threatening to drift even lower given recent trends with the 10-year Treasury — then where is an investor to turn?I say go global — and start staking out a position in emerging markets. The valuations are much cheaper, the momentum is much better and there are some very attractive ETFs that allow you to play the upside potential in these volatile regions but with enough diversification to reduce your risk significantly.Here are three such emerging market ETFs I’m watching now:iShares MSCI Taiwan Index ETF /quotes/zigman/22355/delayed/quotes/nls/ewt EWT -0.31%• 60-day return: 11%• 2014 return: 13%• Net assets: $3.3 billion• Expense ratio: 0.62%, or $62 on every $10,000 investedMany emerging market stocks and ETFs have picked up nicely since their May lows, outperforming the S&P 500 in that period. But one region that has actually outperformed all year long is Taiwan.Stocks in the region largely sat out the 2013 rally, but momentum has picked up this year with double-digit gains in the past two months. Longer term, the iShares MSCI Taiwan Index ETF is up 13% since Jan. 1, double the profits generated by the S&P 500 in the same period.So much for emerging markets being chronic underperformers.Longtime commodity trader Peter Brandt recently shared a chart-heavy analysis of Asian equities, making the case for why “Asian equity markets are on the verge of explosive advances.” For those interested in technical analysis, I highly recommend Peter’s blog post where the charts speak for themselves.Taiwan is a great place to put your cash because it is proximal to mainland China and can benefit from the future growth opportunities there. However, Taiwan still enjoys a small degree of autonomy from Beijing and economic ties with the West that are a bit more robust.The big risk for investors is that technology stocks make up much of the EWT fund, a big reason for its outperformance in 2014. These include tech giant Taiwan Semiconductor /quotes/zigman/189771/delayed/quotes/nls/tsm TSM -0.61% , which represents 21% of the entire fund’s assets.However, I believe that hopes of a continued recovery in the West across the next few years will boost both enterprise and consumer technology sales. Furthermore, if China can continue to transition from a manufacturing powerhouse to a world player in technology and services, Taiwan’s mature businesses in this space will be a big asset.SPDR S&P China ETF /quotes/zigman/478423/delayed/quotes/nls/gxc GXC +0.50%• 60-day return: 7%	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=22B4014A-0917-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

U.K. ready to toughen up takeover rules	By Peter EvansThe new measures — which the government hasn’t detailed, but announced in general terms Sunday — come after U.S. drugs company Pfizer Inc. /quotes/zigman/238207/delayed/quotes/nls/pfe PFE +0.23%   failed to seal a nearly $120 billion deal to buy rival AstraZeneca PLC /quotes/zigman/244926/delayed UK:AZN +0.17%  . The U.K. government wasn’t hostile to that bid but said it would scrutinize it closely, as concerns emerged over potential job cuts in Britain.Vince Cable, business secretary in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government of Prime Minister David Cameron, said that he intends to increase protection for British companies during takeover negotiations when the “national interest” is at stake.Cable, speaking during an interview with the BBC, said there should be “no wiggle room” for foreign companies to renege on commitments — such as maintaining jobs — made during negotiations.The new tack comes amid a frenzy of trans-Atlantic deal talks and agreements. Part of that is being driven by U.S. companies seeking partners that will allow them to relocate out of the U.S. into a more favorable tax regime. Targets for these so-called inversions have included a number of British companies, which enjoy a generally lower tax rate than those in the U.S.Mr. Cable said he wanted to pass the laws as soon as possible, without saying precisely when , because he expected the string of takeover bids by foreign firms for U.K. companies to continue.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.comMore must-reads from MarketWatch:Avoid a U.S. stock-market meltdown and go globalThe sneakiest thing stores do to trick shoppersSheldon Adelson, Warren Buffett agree on one thing	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=07F4F1E6-0B49-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

6 ‘facts’ that stock-market bulls are wrong about	By Brett Arends, MarketWatchBrazil hadn’t lost a major game at home in decades, said the experts.The Brazilians had the best attack, the best defense, the best team — the best everything, they said.And these weren’t just opinions. These were analyses. Quantitative Analysts had produced algorithms — indeed, Proprietary Algorithms — using vast quantities of data to prove their point.And if you can’t trust a Proprietary Algorithm, what can you trust?Really, what else was there to do but to prostrate ourselves in awe before the quants and begin chanting in worship once again “Algo akbur! Algo akbur!” - “The Algorithm is Great! The Algorithm is Great!”Oh well.So much for the conventional wisdom. So much for the quantitative experts and their spreadsheets.Brazil’s humiliating exit in last week’s semifinal 7-1 rout was among the most extraordinary events in World Cup history. No one — least of all me — predicted any such thing.But Brazil nearly exited the cup much earlier. The Brazilians came within inches of being defeated by Chile in the second round, and might, indeed, have lost to Colombia as well in the quarterfinals.The soccer World Cup is over. But the money World Cup — also known as financial markets — continues, as ever.And while we’re on the subject, here are 7-1 (or “6”) other things that everyone “knows” to be true. which actually aren’t.1. ‘On average stocks earn 10% a year.’Actually, depending on the Wall Street marketing department you’re listening to, this may be downgraded to 9% or upgraded to 12%. Regardless, it’s total balderdash.The 12% figure is derived from a meaningless piece of statistical chicanery called the “arithmetic mean.” It can be dismissed.Since the 1920s the compound return has been around 9%, but this, too, is grossly dishonest. These numbers include phony profits caused by inflation, and one-off gains from an upward revaluation of stocks which, by definition, cannot be repeated.Bottom line? The best, most honest guess is that stocks are likely to earn you, after inflation, the net dividend yield plus roughly 1% to 2%. There’s some dispute about the net dividend yield because of the question of stock buybacks, but overall we’re looking at real returns of maybe 4% a year, if we are lucky.2. ‘There’s a lot of money on the sidelines waiting to come in to stocks.’You’ll hear this repeated over and over and over again by stock market scalpers.But there is absolutely no money on the sidelines waiting to come in to stocks. None. Zip. Nada. Rien. How do we know? Easy. Every time somebody buys a stock, somebody else has to sell it.Think about it.You’ve got $100 “on the sidelines” and you want to “put it to work” (yeah) in stocks. So you use it to buy $100 worth of stocks from, say, me. What happens? Before the deal you’ve got $100 “on the sidelines” and I’ve got $100 worth of stocks. Afterward you’ve got my stocks, and I’ve got your $100 in cash. Back on the sidelines.3. ‘Economic growth will be good for stocks.’While the economy was flat on its back, the hucksters told you that this would keep interest rates low, and that was good for stocks.Now that the economy seems to be recovering they’ll tell you this is great for stocks, too.The real problem? There is no link between economic growth and the returns from the stock market. No, really.From 1968 to 1982 the U.S. economy grew by 50% even after adjusting for inflation. Yet over that period investors actually lost money in real terms (even before you count taxes and fees).The Japanese economy is a third bigger than it was in 1989, but anyone who invested in the Nikkei 225 index /quotes/zigman/5986735/delayed JP:NIK +0.88% back then has lost their shirt.Economic research has shown that, if anything, the fastest-growing economies have tended to produce lower, not higher, stock market returns.The U.S. stock market has boomed in the past few years, in large part because the aggressive actions of the Federal Reserve have driven down the short-term costs of borrowing. If the economy picks up the cost of borrowing will rise. Do the math.4. ‘You can’t beat the index.’It has become a new mantra, almost a new religion: Financial experts will tell you that the market is so “efficient” at setting prices that you cannot outperform the index—such as the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.15%  --without taking on more risk.Trouble is, this is wrong.There is a lot of research showing that over time you could have beaten the index simply by investing solely in “value” stocks, namely those which were inexpensive in relation to fundamental measures such as net assets or dividends. You could also have beaten the market by investing in stocks of “high quality” companies, or in stocks with lower volatility, than if you had invested in the standard index.What people forget: The standard indexes are very peculiar. They are heavily biased toward the most popular stocks, as those have the highest market values. So when you invest in an index fund, a large chunk of your money goes into a few names. Just picking stocks at random, and investing in them equally, has produced better returns than the index.5. ‘U.S. corporate balance sheets are in great shape.’Really? Perhaps this explains why, according to the Federal Reserve, U.S. (nonfinancial) corporations today owe a record $9.6 trillion — twice as much as at the start of the millennium, and a rise of 27%, or $2.1 trillion, in the last five years. Indeed, so far this year U.S. nonfinancial businesses have been borrowing nearly $10 billion a day, including Sundays.Naturally, assets can go up as well as liabilities. Some companies, indeed, are holding large piles of net cash — mainly overseas, to avoid the taxman. But overall, according to the Federal Reserve, nonfinancial corporations now carry credit market debts equal to about 50% of their net worth, near record levels.The equivalent figure in the early 1950s? About 21%.6. ‘U.S. households have rebuilt their balance sheets since the financial crisis.’Sure, why not? Actually, since the start of 2008 households, overall, have slashed their total debts by. er. about 6%. Wow.Oh, and the bulk of that reduction hasn’t come from people paying off debts, but from just writing them off. Much of this modest overall debt reduction has come from mortgage defaults, “soft” defaults such as housing short sales, credit card defaults and personal bankruptcies.And despite that, overall household debts have actually been going up for the past two years. As fast as some people have been walking away from debts, others (or perhaps the same ones) have been borrowing more. Ten years ago, in the bad old spendthrift days before the crisis, U.S. families owed $10.5 trillion. Today? Er. $13.2 billion.As soccer fans have just been reminded, just because everybody “knows” something doesn’t mean it’s so.Also by Brett Arends:One trick to make your next flight better—and cheaperHow to beat ETFsLow returns on stocks are the new normal	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=FCA646EC-0AC0-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Citigroup to pay $7 billion to resolve mortgage probe	By Al Lewis, Saabira Chaudhuri and Christina RexrodeThe bank said it will pay a total of $4.5 billion in cash and provide $2.5 billion in consumer relief.

U.S. AG Holder slams Citigroup, warns of possible criminal charges	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the Department of Justices $7 billion settlement with Citigroup Inc. /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C +3.70% announced earlier Monday does not absolve the bank or any of its employees from potential criminal charges. Speaking at a press conference to outline details of the settlement, Holder said the banks misconduct was egregious, that it knew of serious and widespread defects in the increasingly risky loans it was securitizing, but sold them to investors, including federally-insured financial institutions regardless. And they made false statements to investors, in marketing materials, and even in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They led investors and the public to believe that these financial products had been originated in compliance with the law and key underwriting guidelines when this was often not the case, he said. The banks conduct had devastating effects on economies and financial institutions across the globe, he said.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3969F08D-77BF-4F4A-B325-1DBF662D8BA4&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Think twice before you invest in a bear-market fund	By Chuck Jaffe, MarketWatchAs a result, a raft of prognosticators has come out in the last few weeks saying to expect everything from a mild downturn (buying opportunity) to a reason to protect profits and move to cash to a looming decade of financial pain and misery.It’s enough to get investors thinking about buying a bear-market fund.For most people, however, that’s the wrong move, not because the market can ride indefinitely, but because the average investor not only misuses bear-market funds but has horrible timing while doing it.More than other fund types, bearish funds play on those foibles.Speaking simplistically, bear-market funds should make money when the market is going down; they come in a variety of flavors, allowing investors to simply act as if they expect a downturn or to use leverage and double-down on a market drop, trying to turbocharge their gains while the rest of the market feels its pains.Many money managers who run bear-market funds, however, say their products aren’t built so much for profiting from a market decline as they are to protect and hedge against one, diversifying risk; anyone with the urge to bet against the market short-term can use leverage and inverse funds to make short-term moves, but the real point of holding a bearish fund for more than a day or two is that keeping a steady allocation to the dark side is a way to have something positive at times when everything else appears to be in the tank.Brad Lamensdorf, who runs the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF /quotes/zigman/3811962/delayed/quotes/nls/hdge HDGE +0.08%  , an actively managed exchange-traded fund, noted that there are three types of investors who buy bear funds.“There are the people who time the market, who have their statistical proof that they believe will lead to a better risk-adjusted return, and they are using bear funds to execute their moves in and out of the market,” Lamensdorf said.“Then there is the professional allocator, who is using a bear fund to diversify their risk, and every quarter or year they look at their allocations and re-set to them,” he added. “They’re not just letting their Standard & Poor’s 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.15%   allocation move from 40% of their portfolio to 50 or 60% just because the S&P has done well over the last two years.…At every step along the way, they are harvesting gains and reallocating to stay on their plan.”The third kind of investor is the most common, and the one who Lamensdorf and other bear fund managers really don’t want to see in their funds, because they are “emotionally charged people moved by headlines or what is happening now, without really having a plan.”In short, this third group is the average investor who is inspired by bad-news headlines and nervous market calls. They’re chasing performance, most likely with an investment whose strategies they don’t completely understand (it is worth noting that most bear funds carry above-average costs, simply because of the strictures of betting against the market).For investors who want to avoid being sideswiped by their own emotions, it’s best to consider bearish funds as portfolio insurance, protection for some future rainy day, rather than a way to cash in on the market’s painful moves or trends.Funds that bet against an index can be harder to hold in all conditions because their construction means they will go down whenever the index is up; that makes them particularly tough to hold when the market has been running strong.Actively managed bear funds try to profit by picking the losers that exist even when the market is up. Those funds tend to be atop the bear-market category now, because they’re not working against the full tide of the market.Of course, investors can self-insure their portfolio by holding more cash or allocating money away from stocks and into alternative asset classes.That’s why investors who are looking at Dow 17,000 and finding that the number raises fear in their hearts might consider whether they really have the stomach to own a bear fund. Failing to take that step now — waiting instead until bear funds look promising not just because of some scared market-watchers but because the daily declines are starting to mount — is emotional investing, poor timing and improper allocation.Most investors won’t be able to make the move to the dark side, and that’s probably the right choice.“Bear funds definitely aren’t for everybody,” said Lamensdorf, “and if they’re not right for you, it’s better to know that than to buy one and find out later that you aren’t cut out for this kind of investing.”Also see:The truth about Dow 17,000	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=AD8EC752-0B54-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Gold falls on profit taking, weak physical demand	By William L. Watts and Barbara Kollmeyer, MarketWatchAugust gold futures /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 -1.79%  dropped $18.40, or 1.4%, to $1,319 an ounce. September silver /quotes/zigman/12294966/delayed SIU4 -1.87%  fell more than 31 cents, or 1.4%, to $21.15 an ounce.“Overall, we believe that physical demand has remained short of expectations, the latest price increase having been driven largely by speculation,” wrote Eugen Weinberg, commodity strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, in a note.Pointing to India, Weinberg said indications a 10% import duty on gold will remain in place “is also likely to have a dampening effect on future gold demand expectations. In conjunction with a rather below-average monsoon season, this points to below-average gold demand from India.”Gold prices ended last week on a down note, but still managed to register their sixth straight weekly gain. For the week, gold was up 1.3% as uncertainty rattled equities.The dollar index /quotes/zigman/1652083/delayed DXY -0.04% , which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, popped just as gold fell back. A stronger dollar can be a negative for commodities priced in the currency as it makes those commodities more expensive for users of other currencies.On the economic front, nothing major is due Monday, but Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s testimony will be pored over on Tuesday. Also of note, bank and tech earnings will color equity trading throughout the week.Edward Meir of INTL FCStone said he believes last week’s strong showing bodes well for this week.“We were concerned that we were not seeing any follow-through buying to accompany the $40 an ounce spurt higher we saw set in on June 19,” he said. “We therefore expect to see a little more upside action this week, with festering geopolitical hot spots providing support.”But analysts at Barclays were much more cautious on gold. In a note to investors dated July 14, analyst Christopher Louney said recent gains across the metals complex look toppy.“We caution against interpreting recent strength in investor flows as a long-term shift in sentiment, as gold still represents a healthy selling opportunity, in our view,” said Louney. For 2014, Barclays expects gold to average $1,260 an ounce, and drop to $1,200 by the third quarter.Elsewhere in metals trading, October platinum /quotes/zigman/19534176/delayed PLV4 -0.34%  gave up $11.50, or 0.8%, to $1,502.30 an ounce, while September palladium /quotes/zigman/18010104/delayed PAU4 +0.37%  fell $3.90, or 0.4%, to $871.40 an ounce. High-grade copper for September delivery /quotes/zigman/678463/delayed HGU4 -0.26%  was off less than 1 cent at $3.261 a pound.Other must-read MarketWatch stories include:10 biggest market moving events this weekCooler weather on the way but don’t call it a ‘polar vortex’	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=95F4A046-0B07-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Samsung suspends supplier after finding use of child labor	By Min-Jeong LeeLast week, New York-based nonprofit labor group China Labor Watch accused the South Korean company of overlooking the use of child labor at supplier Shinyang Electronics Co., which makes cellphone covers and parts for Samsung /quotes/zigman/189457/delayed KR:005930 +0.16%  in Dongguan, China. China Labor Watch claimed it found several cases of underage workers being put to work at the factory without being paid for overtime hours.Samsung had previously refuted the watchdog’s claims, saying that its previous audits on the factory had revealed “no cases of child labor.”However, in a separate investigation that the company conducted immediately following new allegations raised by China Labor Watch, “Samsung found evidences of illegal hiring process that took place on June 29,” it said in a statement Monday.The report published by China Labor Watch last week had suggested some underage workers were using other people’s IDs to get hired at the factory.“The Chinese authorities are also looking into the case,” Samsung said, adding that “if the investigations conclude that the supplier indeed hired children illegally, Samsung will permanently halt business with the supplier.”An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.comMore must-reads from MarketWatch:Avoid a U.S. stock market meltdown and go globalThe sneakiest things stores do to trick consumersChinese man builds his own Tesla-charging network	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8CCD83D4-0B4D-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Don’t follow the herd on index investing	By Kirk SpanoPaul Merriman recently covered reasons to fall in love with index funds in a recent column. His first reason to use index funds was you wont ever again have to deal with a pushy salesman or broker. While I guess this sounds great, it isnt completely true in many cases. A lot of the money that flowed into index funds was from financial professionals who moved their clients there.Why would financial professionals move toward index funds — primarily in ETFs? The simple reason is that it is the trendy sale suddenly after all this time of selling loaded mutual funds that underperformed. A case of if you cant beat em, then join em if there ever was one. Beware, though, how most financial representatives sell their index-based strategies. It might not be the pushy sales approach that Merriman dislikes, but very well could be brokers in new uniforms regurgitating how they now have a fiduciary responsibility to you and indexing is the way to deliver. Thats at least interesting to me since a lot of the ones Ive known never cared much for fiduciary responsibility when they could make big commissions selling products.Regardless of the sales-driven financial industrys inconsistencies, heres where indexing breaks down. Indexing relies on a very long time frame and takes as much risk as the markets it is invested in. The risk associated with indexing is very underestimated by most people. By definition, you are taking 100% of the risk of the markets you are invested in. In big market downturns, you will suffer. Think about 2008 when virtually everything fell. If that happens to occur again shortly before you plan to retire, or worse, after you have retired, you are in a major bind since withdrawals for income will make it very difficult to fully recover your asset values.For indexers (I index a portion of client money) methodology is vitally important. Most financial advisers practice something called Modern Portfolio Theory, or something close to it. Modern Portfolio Theory using indexes is just another failed strategy that relies on backward-looking return data, though it isnt as failed as MPT using managed mutual funds.A better approach to indexing involves incorporating two ideas into your asset allocation. The first is hedging when markets are rising but becoming dangerous based on mathematical indicators.Here is an example. In the middle of June, I could tell mathematically that the stock market was becoming stretched again and that upward momentum was slowing. The market hadnt actually turned over, however, thus, I didnt want to sell my long holdings, in particular my S&P 500 ETF /quotes/zigman/714403/delayed/quotes/nls/spy SPY +0.52% , which is a regular holding. Instead, I bought some out-of-the-money puts on SPY which would protect me from any large and quick declines in the S&P 500 index.Explaining the math involved in quantitative analysis here would be difficult for me and painful to most, but try to envision this: Imagine a roller coaster and how it slows as it nears the peak of a rise. You cant see over that rise to know if there is a huge plunge or just some dips and turns before the next rise. But you pull on your seat harness anyway to make sure it is locked. That is your hedge.With a stock market index, buying some puts as you enter a slow high point in the market is your hedge. Quite often, as it was in this case, because the broad stock market was going up with low volatility, the puts were cheap, so hedging cost very little and added a lot of safety, all without having to sell core assets.The second thing to consider doing is to quickly sell some or all of your long holdings, once there is a mathematically confirmed downturn in the stock market. This is different from what most people do in trying to predict or time the market. It is simply reaction speed. With this approach, we are simply reacting quicker than the crowd when markets are in the early stages of a downturn. In essence, all we are doing is beating other investors to the exit. By doing this, we get out at higher prices. The reentry happens when the downturn slows and starts to turn back up - this is actually the easier of the two trades.Quantitative analysis is imperfect of course. Using it for short-term trading, like other methods, is almost useless. Im not a short-term trader because of that fact. What I have found it to be most useful for is hedging and position trading. These slow-handed methods have made a lot of difference in the risk levels and ultimate returns for my investors. There is even a simplified way to add quantitative measurement to stock trading so long as you pick out a very good small universe of stocks to work with as I appear to have done recently.If you can do, or you can hire somebody at the lower-end of the expense structure to use, these two strategies, then you have as big a leg up on indexers as they do on most active mutual fund managers. You will also have a leg up on the most important benchmark, not losing a lot of money during a bad market that could ruin your lifestyle in retirement.Disclosure: Kirk and certain clients of Bluemound Asset Management own SPY shares and are long puts on SPY.

Stock market live blog: Dow industrials jump to intraday record; Citi settles, steps higher	We’re live blogging all the action in the stock market on Monday. For a concise rundown of the day’s trading activity, see Market Snapshot.Todd Salamone, senior vice-president of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research said sideways trading is more likely than a massive rally or sell-off in the next few weeks. “The good news for bulls is that a lot of people are expecting bad news, such as a 10% corrections. Investors have been hedging for such an event, as we see from a spike in VIX call options.Because investors hedged their portfolios, we are unlikely to see panic selling when negative news hits equities.“Lack of volatility is not a sign of complacency, rather fear is creating lack of volatility.”Here’s an interesting number tied to Barclays and its recommendations on Apple’s stock: +25%.The bank downgraded the iPhone maker on Feb. 20, then Apple rallied 25% as of Friday’s close before Barclays switched back to overweight this morning.Apple’s shares “may stick close to a trading range for the next year or so” — that was Barclays’ now-obviously-incorrect view back in February.Goldman Sachs has raised its year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 2050 from 1900.MarketWatch’s Ben Eisen has more on Goldman’s view, which the bank outlined in a note dated Friday.So now instead of predicting a slide to 1900 from 1978 (where the S&P stood at last check), Goldman’s forecast implies a 3.6% gain from the current level to 2050 by New Year’s Eve.Citi /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed /quotes/nls/c C has edged down from its session high but the stock is basically holding its gain — up 3.3% at last check.MarketWatch’s Sital Patel is live blogging Citi’s quarterly earnings conference call.Go here to follow along.Photo credit: BloombergThe Dow Jones Industrial Average apparently does not realize that it’s on the wrong side of history.That’s a reference to a column by MarketWatch’s David Weidner.He’s skeptical about the bull market at this point, saying stocks are “squarely out of step.”Read more hereThe Dow has traded as high as 17,085 in the last few minutes, according to FactSet data.The blue-chip barometer was last at 17,076.Its prior intraday record was 17,074.65 — hit on July 3.The Dow’s previous record close was 17,068.26 — also achieved July 3.Photo credit: Getty ImagesIn the last couple of minutes, the Dow has scored a new intraday record and topped its prior record close…Last week, Barclays analysts were saying you shouldn’t overweight the world’s largest company by market cap.Today, they’ve changed their tune, upgrading Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed /quotes/nls/aapl AAPL to overweight and helping the stock gain 1.4%.That puts them back to the point of view they had until February.Does this flip flopping make you think “most of the investment industry is simply unnecessary,” as Al Lewis says? In that case you’ll enjoy this farewell column by Lewis.Getting back to Apple and Barclays…“We believe Tim Cook has solidified his strategy and re-gained the confidence of Apple stakeholders in many ways – reversing many of the warning signs we saw earlier in the year,” the Barclays analysts said in a note.MarketWatch’s Ben Eisen has more info on the upgrade here.Photo credit: ShutterstockThe trend is higher in the first couple of minutes of trading, with the Dow clearing 17,000.Dow +0.6% or 106 points — above 17,000S&P 500 +0.5%Nasdaq +0.6%The M&A news is boosting sentiment, and Citi /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed /quotes/nls/c C also could be cheering investors.The big bank premarket is gaining after a settlement and its earnings report.Citi said this morning that it’s agreed to pay $7 billion to settle allegations it sold shoddy mortgages in the run-up to the financial crisis.With its earnings report,  adjusted profit beat expectations and revenue also topped forecasts. On a nonadjusted basis, profit plunged as that big settlement weighed.It’s another Merger Monday, with plenty of companies saying they’re getting hitched over the weekend and before the open.Shire /quotes/zigman/66975/delayed /quotes/nls/shpg SHPG said it’s received a new takeover offer from AbbVie /quotes/zigman/13067932/delayed /quotes/nls/abbv ABBV , and it’s willing to recommend this deal, valued at more than $53 billion, to its shareholders.Mylan /quotes/zigman/75764/delayed /quotes/nls/myl MYL said it will buy Abbott Labs’ /quotes/zigman/216393/delayed /quotes/nls/abt ABT developed markets branded generics business in a $5.3 billion deal.Both of these deals are tax-inversion moves, where U.S.-based firms move their HQs to other climes for tax reasons.Read more about today’s deals and jumpiest stocks in the Movers & Shakers column.Photo credit: Shutterstock.comGood morning.Stock futures are pointing to a higher open today for Wall Street, which lost ground last week but did end on a positive note with a gain Friday.The S&P 500 lost 0.9% last week, paring its loss Friday by rising 0.2%.Photo credit: Getty ImagesThe Tell is MarketWatch’s fast and engaging look at trends and themes in the day’s markets.

How to get thousands of dollars in mortgage relief from Citigroup	By Catey Hill and Amy Hoak, MarketWatchOn Monday, Citigroup /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C +3.02%   announced it will pay $7 billion to settle charges by the government that it misled investors about the quality of its mortgage securities in the years before the financial crisis. Of that $7 billion, $2.5 billion is earmarked for “consumer relief.”Also see: Citi to pay $7 billion in mortgage settlement — but it may have gotten off easyThis relief will come in a variety of ways, including loan modification for consumers (a minimum of $820 million will go toward this, and it includes principal forgiveness on underwater mortgages), refinancing at lower interest rates to those currently paying high interest rates (a minimum of $299 million; to get credit towards this, Citi must provide at least 200 basis points of relief to a consumer) and down payment and closing cost financial assistance for some buyers (Citi can earn credit towards the $2.5 billion consumer relief requirement by providing this). Plus, Citigroup will give donations to organizations that help communities with redevelopment (a minimum of $50 million) and affordable rental housing for low-income families in high-cost areas ($180 million), according to the Justice Department. Bartlett Collins Naylor, a financial policy advocate for Public Citizen, says that this settlement will likely impact about one million Citi consumers.The settlement is short on specifics, in terms of who exactly qualifies for assistance, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, a provider of consumer loan information. Still, if you’re a Citigroup consumer, there are some things you need to know about the aid program. The full details are available in this document (beware: you may need a lawyer to translate this for you) and the simplified version below.Which Citigroup consumers might qualify for aid?Homeowners struggling to make payments are likely to be some of the biggest beneficiaries. Any struggling borrower whose mortgage is serviced by Citi could possibly be eligible, said Paul Leonard, director of the California office of the Center for Responsible Lending. Those who have tried to obtain assistance in the past may have more luck now, as Citi may have “more of a willingness to work with you,” Gumbinger said.The relief that Citi provides will “ensure that a homeowner is no longer underwater and will extinguish second and junior liens,” according to the Department of Justice. Much of the relief provided by Citi will be in areas defined by HUD as having a high number of vacant or distressed properties and foreclosures, according to the Department of Justice.While down payment or closing cost assistance might also be offered, it’s likely that Citi will “look to help troubled existing clients in their portfolio first,” Gumbinger said. Those that do get down payment and closing cost assistance will likely be borrowers in some of the areas hardest hit by the mortgage crisis, those who lost homes to foreclosure and short sale and first-time, low-to-moderate income borrowers, according to the Department of Justice.How will I know if I’ve become eligible for aid?Citi will notify you. Under the settlement agreement, “Citi will engage in broad-ranging outreach—including multilingual outreach—to ensure that eligible homeowners and potential borrowers are aware of the relief that may be available to them,” according to documents from the Department of Justice. Citigroup is currently evaluating its consumers to determine who is eligible for the aid and will let you know if you are one of them, says Mark Costiglio, a spokesperson for the bank. He declined to comment further when asked for more specifics on eligibility.When can I expect to get the aid?The short answer: likely in the next three years. There’s a time window to pay out this money. If Citigroup fails to distribute all the funds by the end of 2018, the company must make a payment to NeighborWorks America, an organization focused on affordable housing and community development, Gumbinger said. There are also incentives for finishing before Oct. 1, 2015, Leonard said. For that reason, there could be a strong push early on to spend some of these funds, he said. And that’s a good thing because for borrowers at risk, “every day that goes by is a missed opportunity,” Leonard said.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=841BBCDC-0B9E-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Three reasons why big investors are betting on housing	By Ruth Mantell, MarketWatchJust ask Federal Reserve officials , who laid out a laundry list last week of factors behind the sluggish housing market. To name just a few: credit standards are strict, families are having trouble saving enough for high down payments, and costs are rising.The housing market has been so disappointing for so long that many have lost hope for much improvement. But big investors say the recovery hasn’t petered out and are holding onto shares of builders, lenders and other housing-related companies.Here are three reasons that big investors are optimistic about the housing market.Let’s start with somewhat of a glass-half-full outlook. Construction and sales rates for new single-family homes remain low enough that they are unlikely to fall, given the overall economy’s strength.“The new-home market is about the only part of the U.S. domestic economy that still remains in recession territory,” said Michael Shaoul, chief executive of Marketfield Asset Management, a major shareholder of Lennar /quotes/zigman/232035/delayed/quotes/nls/len LEN -0.07% , the biggest U.S. home builder by market capitalization. “I don’t think that normality for the U.S. economy and the abnormality of the U.S. housing market can coexist for too much longer.”Sales of new single-family homes recently hit an annual rate of 504,000 , up 17% from a year earlier, but far below an average annual pace of almost 940,000 over the decade leading up to a 2005 peak. Likewise, new construction on single-family homes recently reached an annual pace of 625,000 starts , up 5% from a year earlier, but below an average pace of almost 1.4 million starts over the decade leading up to a 2006 peak.“To see a housing-market collapse from this level would be exceptional given what’s happening in the rest of the economy,” Shaoul said. “The housing market has tried everybody’s patience, but it’s much more likely that the recovery extends.”And years of turmoil has led to a happy result for market survivors: Builders such as Lennar and other housing-related companies have become more efficient — a quality that may not be priced into shares right now.Lenders such as Bank of America /quotes/zigman/190927/delayed/quotes/nls/bac BAC +1.63%  and J.P. Morgan Chase /quotes/zigman/272085/delayed/quotes/nls/jpm JPM +1.33%  have seen mortgage originations tumble in recent quarters as rates rose. With loans at such low levels, origination growth may pick up, analysts said.“Certainly they are facing easier comparisons,” said Sandy Sanders, a Manulife portfolio manager. “These companies are coming out leaner, stronger and more efficiently run than they were three to five years ago.”Also, the fallout from bad loans may be subsiding.“Most companies going forward will see less legal and headline risk with regard to major new financial penalties and fines,” Sanders said.Employers are hiring more and announcing few layoffs , while workers are becoming increasingly confident . Those are the sorts of trends that support home sales, economists say.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3B10CCBA-0853-11E4-9B32-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Techs gain broadly; Apple rises on analyst upgrade	By Rex Crum, MarketWatchApple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +1.49%  rose 1.2%, to $96.37 a share after Reitzes lifted his view on the company to overweight, or buy, from equal weight, and also raised his price target on Apple’s stock to $110 a share from $95. Reitzes said that he believes Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook “has solidified his strategy and regained the confidence of Apple stakeholders in many ways, reversing many of the warning signs we saw earlier in the year.” Apple is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results on July 22.Apple also took to its Chinese Web site to refute allegations that the location-tracking function of the iPhone is a threat to China’s national security.Among other leading tech stocks, gains came from Facebook Inc. /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB +2.23% , Oracle Corp. /quotes/zigman/19452757/delayed/quotes/nls/orcl ORCL +0.80% , Amazon.com Inc. /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN +2.21%  and Netflix Inc. /quotes/zigman/87598/delayed/quotes/nls/nflx NFLX +3.31% . EBay Inc. /quotes/zigman/76117/delayed/quotes/nls/ebay EBAY -0.52%  lost ground, shedding 1% to trade at $50.95. On Sunday, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Chad Bartley cut his rating on eBay to sector perform from outperform. Bartley said that a combination of a security breach at eBay earlier this year, and a change in Google Inc.’s /quotes/zigman/93888/delayed/quotes/nls/googl GOOGL +0.85%  search algorithm likely had a negative impact on eBay’s business during the second quarter of the year.The Nasdaq Composite Index /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP +0.65%  rose 22 points to 4,438 and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index /quotes/zigman/1468249/delayed SOX +0.46%  was also in positive territory.Apple denies it’s a threat to China’s securityThe sneakiest things stores do to trick shoppers	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7202D6DE-0B5D-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Adidas declares World Cup sales victory	By Monica Houston-WaeschThe company, which outfitted the German national team as well as beaten finalists Argentina, is counting on the tournament to boost sales this year and is targeting soccer-related revenue of EUR2 billion ($2.7 billion) compared with EUR1.5 billion in 2010 when the World Cup was last held.“Our soccer revenue is at a record level, and we were the most mentioned brand in social media. With that, we clearly dominated the tournament on the field and off,” Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said Monday.Investors appeared to agree, with Adidas /quotes/zigman/619210/delayed DE:ADS +2.48%   shares rising 2.5% on Monday.As well as outfitting several competing national teams, Adidas, which expects to sell over 14 million soccer balls and 8 million jerseys this year, pays FIFA to be an official sponsorship, supply, and licensing rights to the event, a position it has secured until 2030.For Adidas, the association with the World Cup is its ace in the hole against the number-one sportswear maker Nike Inc. /quotes/zigman/235840/delayed/quotes/nls/nke NKE +0.85%  because soccer is one sport where the Germans, like on the pitch, are out ahead of their U.S. rival.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Manchester United in 10-year sponsorship deal with Adidas6 ‘facts’ that stock-market bulls are wrong aboutHow to avoid a market meltdown	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=6F12BB34-0B66-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Alibaba points to richer valuation; Yahoo rises	By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatchYahoo /quotes/zigman/59898/delayed/quotes/nls/yhoo YHOO +0.93%  was up nearly 1% to $35.75 as investors await the company’s second-quarter earnings report, due after the closing bell Tuesday. Yahoo shares have rallied about 7% in the past three months.Alibaba late last week updated its IPO filing to suggest a valuation of $130 billion, up from $117 billion, according to estimates by The Wall Street Journal. The estimate was based on Alibaba’s disclosure of its stock-based compensation, which it set at $56 a share, up from $50 in a previous filing. Yahoo owns a 24% stake in Alibaba.Analysts are waiting for signs of what Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer plans to do with the cash haul from the Alibaba IPO.In a Monday note, B. Riley analyst Sameet Sinha told clients, “Ultimately Alibaba and use of IPO proceeds determine the value. Alibaba’s IPO, which could happen in August 2014, is ultimately the determinant of Yahoo’s stock price.”However, Sinha also noted, “With the IPO imminent, the question will be about use of the proceeds. We do not think Yahoo management will lay out a plan as yet for the proceeds which could disappoint investors.”Yahoo plan for cash draws attentionThe truth about Dow 17,000	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=055197C6-0B64-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14
Comedian Tracy Morgan sues Wal-Mart in fatal crash	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Comedian Tracy Morgan has sued Wal-Mart Stores Inc. /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed/quotes/nls/wmt WMT -0.26% in U.S. District Court in New Jersey for negligence, after one of its truck drivers crashed into Morgans limousine on June 7, killing one passenger and injuring four, including Morgan, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The suit claims the driver of the Wal-Mart truck, Kevin Ropwer, 35, of Jonesboro, Ga., was speeding when he fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into the entertainers vehicle after having been awake for more than 24 hours, according to the report. The suit alleges Wal-Mart should have known the drivers hours violated federal laws aimed at preventing fatigue, the Journal said. Morgan and the other passengers are seeking a jury trial and damages. Wal-Mart said it was cooperating with the investigation and expressed its condolences. We know it will take some time to resolve all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident, but were committed to doing the right thing for all involved, the company said. Roper has pleaded not guilty to New Jersey state charges death by auto and assault by auto, according to the Journal report.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7B483939-492D-4A83-B05D-4C251DAED605&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Apple to get big sales boost from iWatch, says Morgan Stanley	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) - Morgan Stanley on Monday raised its price target for Apple Inc. to $110 from $99, citing potential gains from the expected rollout of a smartwatch, dubbed the iWatch. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said she expects Apple to sell 30 million to 60 million iWatch units in the products first 12 months. The device is expected to price at roughly $300 each, she said. In our view, Apple will introduce a device with more sensors, and better form factor and aesthetics than competing devices in the market priced at $100 to $250, she told clients in a note. Huberty also boosted her calendar 2015 revenue estimate for Apple by $16 billion, with $12 billion coming from an estimated 41 million iWatch shipments. Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +1.45% shares were up 1.5% to $96.64. The stock also got a boost from a Barclays upgrade.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=45EB7743-B321-4B6E-B567-C439243EF945&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14
Univision becomes takeover bait amid World Cup	By Jon Friedman, MarketWatchWith major American broadcasting companies ever anxious to tap into the fast-growing Hispanic-American market, Univision may find renewed interest as a potential takeover target.Prominent media companies have long expressed a desire to grow through high-profile acquisitions. For instance, Comcast /quotes/zigman/89307/delayed/quotes/nls/cmcsa CMCSA +1.26%  agreed to acquire Time Warner Cable /quotes/zigman/528868/delayed/quotes/nls/twc TWC +0.95%  earlier this year for $45 billion. That proposed deal requires approval by the U.S. government.Meanwhile, the New York Times has noted that such behemoths as Time Warner /quotes/zigman/528906/delayed/quotes/nls/twx TWX -0.64%  and CBS /quotes/zigman/393390/delayed/quotes/nls/cbs CBS -0.90%  may be interested in buying Univision. It could fetch as much as $20 billion in an acquisition.Univision is a company that finds itself in the sweet spot. Fresh off an impressive broadcasting performance in the much-discussed World Cup tournament, it provides a passport to a much-desired consumer market. It’s available on cable and satellite television.Just as warring nations engage in an arms race, the media giants are locked in an eyeballs chase. The more customers and users they can amass, the more attractive they’ll appear to be to advertisers. With advertising dollars steadily migrating away from traditional print-media outlets, media entities are anxious to show corporations that they command not only a high number of news consumers but, crucially, the choice demographics.During the soccer tournament, Univision experienced a roughly 60% jump in viewers, many of whom preferred to enjoy the Spanish-language announcers instead of the crew from ESPN/ABC /quotes/zigman/245568/delayed/quotes/nls/dis DIS +0.16% , according to media coverage.Anticipating the importance of having a footprint in the World Cup broadcasts, Univision shrewdly invested millions of dollars in technology that enabled its commentators to announce a goal a few seconds before the ESPN/ABC team.Even exclusive of the World Cup, the Hispanic market is attractive to American companies because it is exploding across the United States. As Nielsen.com pointed out in a 2013 study, Charlotte, N.C., which “isn’t traditionally thought of as a Latino market,” finds that its Hispanic population “is growing faster than any other region in the country.” The major growth seen in such market centers as New York City and Los Angeles several years ago is now being experienced in mid-size U.S. cities .Univision may eventually need to find a U.S. partner as a way to keep pace with the strides being made by Univision’s rival, Telemundo. Comcast owns Telemundo as well as NBC Universal.Telemundo for the first time outbid Univision for the next two World Cups, which Univision had held on to since 1972. Boosted by Comcast’s deep pockets, Telemundo is clearly making progress.Univision is controlled by a consortium of investors headed by Haim Saban. His organization took command of Univision in 2007 for $13.7 billion.For its part, Univision bristles at the notion that it should continue to be identified as some sort of a Hispanic broadcaster. Its executives see their company as a direct competitor to the large American broadcasters. If one of those foes succeeds in scooping up Univision, it would have an ever higher profile.More from MarketWatch:Emmys underscore who’s providing the buzzThink twice before you invest in a bear-market fundChinese man builds his own Tesla-charging network	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=D7306FE8-0B6D-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14
European stocks climb for second day; Shire rises	By Sara Sjolin, MarketWatchThe Stoxx Europe 600 index /quotes/zigman/2380150/delayed XX:SXXP +0.85%  picked up 0.9% to close at 339.79, after last werek posting its biggest weekly percentage loss since March.Last week’s losses came as Portuguese conglomerate Espírito Santo International SA /quotes/zigman/176527/delayed PT:BES -7.48%   missed an interest payment, sending shivers through Portugal’s financial sector and spurring fears about the rest of the Espirito Santo empire.Trading in Banco Espírito Santo SA /quotes/zigman/176527/delayed PT:BES -7.48%  was suspended late last week. On Monday, shares slid 7.5% even as the bank appointed Vítor Bento, a well-respected economist, as its new chief executive in an effort to restore confidence in the company. Pedro Passos Coelho, Portugal’s prime minister, over the weekend ruled out any potential state support for the lender and said “private businesses have to suffer the consequences of the bad deals they make,” according to Financial Times.“It’s hardly surprising that, just five years on from the worst global banking crisis in recent memory, the market has the scope to overreact to banking-contagion fears,” said David White, trader at Spreadex, in a note.Portugal’s PSI 20 index /quotes/zigman/3171650/delayed PT:PSI20 +0.63%  rose 0.6% to 6,181.73, and Portuguese government bonds also continued to rise, sending the yield on 10-year government paper down 5 basis points to 3.79%.Elsewhere, France’s CAC 40 index /quotes/zigman/3173214/delayed FR:PX1 +0.78%  gained 0.8% to 4,350.04. Germany’s DAX 30 index /quotes/zigman/2380246/delayed DX:DAX +1.21%  rallied 1.2% to 9,783.01, a day after the country won the World Cup title in soccer against Argentina.The U.K.’s FTSE 100 index /quotes/zigman/3173262/delayed UK:UKX +0.84%  added 0.8% to 6,746.14. Shire PLC /quotes/zigman/508678/delayed UK:SHP +0.68%  gained 0.7% after a revised offer from AbbVie Inc. /quotes/zigman/13067932/delayed/quotes/nls/abbv ABBV -0.40% .

The report comes after France, Italy and Germany all posted disappointing data last week.Later in the week, German’s ZEW report, euro-zone trade data and inflation numbers will provide further insights into the strength of the region’s recovery.

Marc Faber, aka Dr. Doom, sticks to stock-swoon call	By Barbara Kollmeyer, MarketWatchMarc Faber, the editor and publisher of the “The Gloom, Boom & Doom Report”, is among a handful of doomsters who have been predicting a correction for stock markets. And with the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.50%  up more than 6% this year, grinding its way through year five of a bull market, those calls are hardly being ignored.Faber’s call is among the most dramatic and he tends makes the headlines when he opens his mouth. He has been expecting a big pullback since 2012 and recently predicted to CNBC a rout like 1987, when the Dow industrials dropped 22.6% in a single day. Not everyone agrees with him, of course. Jim Paulson, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, last week predicted a pullback for this year, but also a multiyear run for this bull market. Goldman Sachs raised its S&P target to 2,050 from 1,900 on Monday.Among the stocks that Faber does find attractive are commodity-related issues. In his July newsletter he highlighted gold and silver-mining shares as among the very few sectors that are “extremely depressed and offer an opportunity for potentially very high capital gains.” Oil stocks got a nod on the view the Fed and other central banks will speed up money printing if the economy or markets begin to weaken, also good for gold.Separately, Faber said momentum stocks like Twitter Inc. /quotes/zigman/23556538/delayed/quotes/nls/twtr TWTR +1.88% and Veeva Systems Inc.  /quotes/zigman/21690485/delayed/quotes/nls/veev VEEV +0.74%  are back to being potentially good short calls, as was his stance earlier this year. Also read: Gold stock rally ‘foreshadows a trend’ for the metalRead on for MarketWatch’s interview with Faber, conducted July 8, in which he expands on that bearish stock call and also talks about warnings signs from retail, and why he wouldn’t waste his time talking to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen.MarketWatch: What are your valuation thoughts with the Dow industrials /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.72%  having recently hit 17,000 and the S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.50% not far off from 2,000?Faber: There are far more intelligent people than I who have valuation models...and according to their models, the higher the market is, the lower future returns. Over the next 10 years, returns from assets will be disappointing for most investors.MarketWatch: What about this 30% stock drop? When is it coming?Faber: Since 2012, I have been expecting a correction that hasn’t happened, but it has happened in individual stocks, and it has happened in emerging economies. A 30% [drop] would not surprise me, but the financial media doesn’t believe it can happen. When the S&P was at 666 on March 6, 2009, they didn’t believe the S&P would go to 2,000 either.The market is very overbought. The rise this year has been accompanied by fewer and fewer stocks making new highs. GE /quotes/zigman/227468/delayed/quotes/nls/ge GE +0.68% , GM /quotes/zigman/1466682/delayed/quotes/nls/gm GM -0.69% , IBM /quotes/zigman/230066/delayed/quotes/nls/ibm IBM +1.02% , Wal-Mart /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed/quotes/nls/wmt WMT -0.31%  are no longer participating in the advance. [but] if stocks went down 30% I’d be interested again.MarketWatch: What is retail telling us now?Faber: Wal-Mart [shares] peaked out in February and since then, the stock has been moving sideways. As as an economic indicator, Wal-Mart is a very good say symptom of what is happening to the consumer and if their sales are flat or down, or Coca-Cola’s /quotes/zigman/222647/delayed/quotes/nls/ko KO +0.63%  in the U.S., it tells you something about the consumer.MarketWatch: You recently stated [to CNBC] that the global economy isn’t strengthening, but weakening. Where are the trouble spots?Faber: When I travel and look around economies, I don’t see the global economy strengthening, I see it weakening. In Asia, we don’t have a recession per se, it is just economic growth has slowed down meaningfully or there is no growth at all .We are now in the fifth year of an economic recovery which began in June 2009 in the U.S. and we’re more than in the fifth year of a bull market that began on March 6, 2009. This is a very mature economic recovery...it would seem to me that the monetary policies that central banks pursue are negative for economic growth, but they are positive for asset price increases. As a result of asset price increases, lots of goods have become unaffordable for the typical household.MarketWatch: What’s the number-one thing people aren’t paying attention to right now?Faber: Everyone thinks alike in the sense they say central banks will continue to print money and as a result asset prices will go up. When everyone thinks alike, no one is thinking clearly. We’ve seen cases where interest rates remain low or went down and markets still fell, like in Japan or the U.S. after March 2000. In 2001, they slashed the fed funds rate from 6.5% to 1%, yet the Nasdaq /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP +0.54%  still fell, the housing market still fell...the fact that you have low interest rates doesn’t mean low asset prices cannot go down.MarketWatch: If you met Fed Chairwoman Yellen in an elevator what would you say to her?Faber: It’s pointless to talk to Fed members about economics because they are academics who believe in money printing. Some of them believe they didn’t print enough, and so with these kinds of people, it is like running to the pope. What do you want to tell them? It’s pointless to spend time with these people trying to convince them that their monetary policies have been very destructive. They bailed out Mexico in 1994, and there was an EM bubble until 1997. They then bailed out LTCM (Long-Term Capital Management), which gave a signal to leverage up...then they had the Nasdaq bubble, then they printed again and had the housing bubble. David Hume and Irving Fisher said bubbles are very destructive to the majority of market participants. They lose money, the minority makes money. The Fed doesn’t see it that way so it is pointless to talk to these people.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Crashy Marc Faber: It’s too late to buy U.S. stocks nowBull market has longer to run: MarketWatch readersU.S. stocks will be ‘very disappointing’ for 10 years	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=80D6ED4E-08FB-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14
Apple rises after Barclays raises rating	By Rex Crum, MarketWatchReitzes lifted his take on Apple to outperform from equal weight, and raised his price target on the company’s stock to $110 a share from $95, saying that Cook has “re-gained the confidence of Apple stakeholders in many ways, reversing many of the warning signs we saw earlier in the year.”Apple shares rose 1.4% to $96.50 following Reitzes rating upgrade.The analyst added that “checks around new products into 2015 are so strong, we are compelled to get on board” and he is more upbeat about Apple because of recent signs of weakness from rival Samsung.“The run rate demand for iPhones globally ahead of the major product transitions seems to be running well ahead of our prior views [and is] not only propping up earnings near term but showing a larger brand appeal internationally for the new phones once launched in the near future,” Reitzes said.With Apple set to release its quarterly earnings results on July 22, Reitzes raised his earnings estimate on the company to $1.24 a share from $1.21 a share, and also raised his sales outlook to $38.3 billion from $37.9 billion.Tech stocks start week off with broad gainsEBay to stream live auctions online for Sotheby’s	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=1FDDEE7A-0B67-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

There was also a decline in investment sales revenues in Asia, which tends to reflect the capital markets environment, he said.“Despite headwinds, most underlying drivers remain positive,” said Gerspach.Citi continues to re-size its retail operation, over the past 12 months, it has closed or sold 70 branches, said the CFO. Retail services revenue was up 7% and branded cards revenue was up by 3%.Legal and re-positioning costs were elevated in Q2 driven by Korea, said Gerspach.“Core operating expenses continued to decline and Citi expects to make further progress in reducing core expenses in the second half of the year.” The bank said credit losses continue to improve.Citi released a $254 million of loan-loss reserves, the vast majority of which was related to North American mortgages.Attorney General Eric Holder at a press conference taking place during the investor call says: “Citi settlement doesn’t absolve bank, employees from criminal charges.” Citi settled for $7 billion with the government over allegations of selling shoddy mortgage securities to investors leading up the financial crisis.Citi expects reserve releases to be lower in the second half of the year, says CFO. Now it’s the analysts turn to ask questions.First comes from John McDonald from Bernstein about legal costs.Will the settlement now take  a lot of the mortgage exposure off the table for Citi?CFO: “I think with the legacy mortgage settlement behind us, we wouldn’t expect holdings to have any significant level of legal charges in the second half of 2014. As I said, legal expenses at Citicorp, they’re going to remain somewhat elevated and episodic in nature.”“I wouldn’t expect anything significant.”Analyst asks about CCAR process and confidence in the ability to satisfy the Fed?CEO Corbat answers saying there’s not much they can say.“I think to summarize that, we still  are operating and feel strongly this is not an issue with our business model, our strategy levels of capital clearly our ability to generate capital.”“We feel good about the progress. We feel very good about the communication with the Fed. But it’s a work in progress and we have more work to do between now and year-end.”Meanwhile, at another press conference, U.S. AG Eric Holder slams Citi, warns of criminal charges. Holder said the bank’s misconduct was “egregious.”More here. CFO acknowledges explicitly the drop in equities trading revenue in Q2 was largely due to hedging in Europe over what was thought to be significant negative market reaction to the Russia/Ukraine situation.“Ultimately, that did not materialize to the extent we had planned for. So as a consequence, our actions to de-risk  the book actually resulted in realized losses during the quarter.”CEO Mike Corbat says Citi’s fixed-income business slowdown is largely cyclical and expects volatility to come back.“…the real slowdown is on the more active trading and that largely being a result of the lower volatility so I would view of a lot of that as being largely cyclical…” How does $C (citigroup) have to pay $7 BILLION DOLLARS in mortgage related fines but no one goes to jail? stock is up 4% on the news #stocks— DJ Ryan Brown (@DJRyanBrown) July 14, 2014Citi .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed /quotes/nls/c C share up 3.66%.cYour browser does not support iframes.Legal expenses to remain elevated and “episodic in nature,” says CFO.Expect more to come on expense outlook, says Citi.Analyst Mike Mayo gets in with his questions about hedging losses in EMEA and Korea headwinds abating.About 10% of equity trading losses were from hedging against Ukraine-Russia situation, around a $100 million, says CFO.“Korea turned a pre-tax profit, we are encouraged about the future direction of the consumer franchise in Korea.”Mayo asks what else is out there in terms of exposure to legal settlements. Is it FX and Libor, or other big ones?CEO Corbat gives the standard pat answer: “We don’t comments in terms of forward-looking legal.”CEO Corbat says the magnitude Of $7 billion settlement number was motivated by getting immunity for future CDO liability.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announces $182 million for New Yorkers as part of Citi settlement.Citi’s FICC revenues were down 12%. That was primarily driven by rates in currencies, said the CFO.“Rates and currencies are going to respond to what’s going on in the market…our results in the second quarter benefited from some outside gains that we took as we correctly lowered our inventories in our local markets business in anticipation of increased negative sentiment in the e- associated with the tapering.” Analyst asks about the possibility of a large box sale in Citi Holdings? Is that feasible?Corbat responds by saying, if the price is right, sure, but “it’s not there” . But if an opportunity were to present itself, the bank would be happy to react to it.Citi says y-o-y rates and currencies revenues were down 30%, down 23% excluding idiosyncratic things from q2 2013. $C— John Carney (@carney) July 14, 2014Analyst Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets points to Citi’s swift reduction of bank branches in North America. How much is left?CFO says we will continue to see “centralization of our branches around the key metropolitan areas.”Without giving any numbers, the CFO says there is “some level of branch rationalization yet to go.”The bank closed or sold 70 branches in the last 12 months.Is 7 billion really a huge deal, when banks like $C get to borrow money from the gov’t at 0% interest?— John Stockman (@johnny_stockman) July 14, 2014Watch @WSJLive segment on Citi’s $7 billion settlement with DOJ:CFO expects loans to grow.“We still have loan growth and again if you focus on the Citicorp business, the Citicorp loans grew 8% year-over-year and we anticipate getting good healthy loan growth in our Citi core businesses.”Analyst  Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo asks for more color on underwriting strength and M&A strength.Other than saying it’s “widespread,” CFO doesn’t say much more. “I’d say it’s fairly widespread. Obviously it’s going to be heavier in some geographies than others and I don’t want to get into geography-by-geography commentary,” says CFO Gerspach.CFO feels very good about revenue momentum in both Latin America and Asia franchises.“We have ongoing revenue growth and have had ongoing revenue growth in Latin America even as Mexico has slowed down.”“When you take a look at Asia, we now have got the Korea re-positioning behind us. And we have had underlying growth in each of our franchises in Asia over the last several quarters…” Nearly almost two hours, the Citi analyst call concludes.The Tell is MarketWatch’s fast and engaging look at trends and themes in the day’s markets.

Stock market live blog: Dow hits intraday record; Tesla rises, GoPro falls and Citi settles	We’re live blogging all the action in the stock market on Monday. For a concise rundown of the day’s trading activity, see Market Snapshot.The best-performing sectors in the S&P 500 so far Monday are information technology (up 0.89%) and energy (up 0.78%).Info tech stocks are led by Facebook Inc.  /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed /quotes/nls/fb FB (up 2.7%) and Micron Technology Inc.  /quotes/zigman/75433/delayed /quotes/nls/mu MU , up 2.3%.The energy sector is being led by Cimarex Energy Co.  /quotes/zigman/311672/delayed /quotes/nls/xec XEC  (up 1.8%) and EOG Resources Inc.  /quotes/zigman/248503/delayed /quotes/nls/eog EOG (up 1.74%).Rick Santelli, who many know as that CNBC reporter that reminds you the volume is too high on the television, just had his latest — and loudest? — meltdown. Santelli, who reports from the Chicago Board of Trade, got into a fight with economics reporter Steve Liesman on CNBC, which deteriorated into Santelli’s own special brand of commentary about how the Federal Reserve has stifled the market of all ability to express itself — or something like that.MarketWatch’s Steve Goldstein has your write-up here.Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, thinks that “a big multi-year advance has left stock valuations stretched, and as a consequence, vulnerable to bad news.” Here’s his insight on where to find value“In a world in which stretched valuations leave stocks dependent on the Fed’s cheap money policies and vulnerable to bad news, we’d continue to emphasize a value bias. For domestic stocks, this suggests leaning toward large- and mega-cap names, which have outperformed small caps by roughly 6% year-to-date. Outside of the United States, investors, particularly those with little exposure, should take another look to emerging markets (EM) stocks. Since the April lows, EM stocks have modestly outperformed developed markets and inflows continue. For the week ended July 9, EM equities garnered another $1.4 billion. If nothing else, we read this as a sign that investors are aware that stocks in the developed world are looking pricey.”Here’s a quick check on the indexes, with less than three hours to go in the session:S&P 500: up 9 points at 1,977DJIA: up 120 points at 17,064Nasdaq: Up 27 points at 4,442The Market Snapshot is fresh off the presses for your perusal.[Corrects mistaken stock prices.]Shares of GoPro Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/34007695/delayed /quotes/nls/gpro GPRO are down 4.8% on the day, following an article in Barron’s  over the weekend that said the wearable camera maker’s recent “thrill-filled IPO adventure may end badly.”Few seem to want to pull punches when talking about GoPro, at least if we’re judging by MarketWatch columnists. Take this one, from Trading Deck columnist Tom Lloyd Sr.: “GoPro has broken its fundamental moorings and is a hot IPO balloon that is moving higher until the hot air runs out.”You’ve doubtless heard about the decline in trading revenues among the big banks — a particularly timely topic given the glut of bank earnings this week. But there’s no more visceral image than an empty trading floor to give a sense of what this low volume market is doing to the banks. The Wall Street Journal has just that kind of story in its Monday edition:“UBS AG ’s trading floor in Stamford, Conn., once teemed with traders occupying a space equal to two football fields. The Guinness World Records recognized it as the biggest such facility on the planet. And the Swiss bank used it to showcase its Wall Street credentials….“Today, there are virtually no traders shouting into their phones or staring at terminals. UBS’s cavernous floor is taken up mostly by back-office, legal and technology staffers, according to people familiar with the bank.”The full story, by  Katy Burne, Justin Baer, and Saabira Chaudhuri, can be found here.Merger news and Citi’s settlement help take the Dow past 17,000. Adrienne Mitchell reports.Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s high yield researchers are out with a note Monday looking at how low yields have gotten in the junk bond space. While there’s lots of talk about whether the current high prices and low yields in the asset class can be maintained, the analysts, led by Michael Contopoulos, don’t see any changes on the horizon in the near-term.“According to our most recent credit investor survey, investors think that HY is overvalued, and have reduced their overweight positions. But at the same time they also expect credit spreads to grind tighter in the short term. We agree, as we think that the risk, in the absence of any rates volatility and exogenous shocks, is to the upside.”AAPLYour browser does not support iframes.Apple Inc .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed /quotes/nls/aapl AAPL  is getting a lot of love from analysts today. Analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley raised their price targets for the stock.Earlier, Barclays upgraded the stock to overweight from equal-weight and raised their price target to $110 from $95, citing a more optimistic outlook.Morgan Stanley raised it price target to $110 from $99, citing potential gains from the expected roll-out of a smartwatch, dubbed the iWatch.Shares are up 1.7%.Investors returned from the weekend in a buying mood. The market has “defied all odds,” according to CEO Vince Lowry of RevenueShares. He sees further gains in the second half, although he says a correction of between 5% and 10% would be healthy.Caution flags continue to wave for the markets as several put/call ratios and other indicators have hovered at long-term or all-time extremes for four straight weeks, says Randy Frederick, Managing Director of Trading and Derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.Frederick has been expecting a -3.5% to -5% pullback for the past few weeks, and all that’s been missing is a catalyst. This week, European data and Portuguese bank-induced market jitters just might play that role. Telsa Motors shares are up 4.6% at $228.29. We think shares are reacting to news from China – as in, Beijing has mandated that a big chunk of government-purchased cars be electric vehicles. (Via Barrons ).On Saturday, China posted new rules that would require at least 30% of government auto purchases to be electric vehicles. Stocks are firmly in the green and if the Dow Industrials closes at this level, it will be a record.S&P 500 .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX  +0.57%Dow .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA  +0.77%Nasdaq .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP  +0.70%Russell 2000 .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/2759624/delayed RUT  +0.77%As investors push stocks into record territory, traders are dumping gold.August gold futures are down more than 2%, leaving it on track for the biggest daily drop for the yellow metal since December.Many analysts are putting the move down to profit taking on the back of a six week rally that was supported in part by turmoil in Iraq and the Middle East.

Investors have been hedging for such an event, as we see from a spike in VIX call options.Because investors hedged their portfolios, we are unlikely to see panic selling when negative news hits equities.“Lack of volatility is not a sign of complacency, rather fear is creating lack of volatility.”Here’s an interesting number tied to Barclays and its recommendations on Apple’s stock: +25%.The bank downgraded the iPhone maker on Feb. 20, then Apple rallied 25% as of Friday’s close before Barclays switched back to overweight this morning.Apple’s shares “may stick close to a trading range for the next year or so” — that was Barclays’ now-obviously-incorrect view back in February.Goldman Sachs has raised its year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 2050 from 1900.MarketWatch’s Ben Eisen has more on Goldman’s view, which the bank outlined in a note dated Friday.So now instead of predicting a slide to 1900 from 1978 (where the S&P stood at last check), Goldman’s forecast implies a 3.6% gain from the current level to 2050 by New Year’s Eve.Citi /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed /quotes/nls/c C has edged down from its session high but the stock is basically holding its gain — up 3.3% at last check.MarketWatch’s Sital Patel is live blogging Citi’s quarterly earnings conference call.Go here to follow along.Photo credit: BloombergThe Dow Jones Industrial Average apparently does not realize that it’s on the wrong side of history.That’s a reference to a column by MarketWatch’s David Weidner.He’s skeptical about the bull market at this point, saying stocks are “squarely out of step.”Read more hereThe Dow has traded as high as 17,085 in the last few minutes, according to FactSet data.The blue-chip barometer was last at 17,076.Its prior intraday record was 17,074.65 — hit on July 3.The Dow’s previous record close was 17,068.26 — also achieved July 3.Photo credit: Getty ImagesIn the last couple of minutes, the Dow has scored a new intraday record and topped its prior record close…Last week, Barclays analysts were saying you shouldn’t overweight the world’s largest company by market cap.Today, they’ve changed their tune, upgrading Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed /quotes/nls/aapl AAPL to overweight and helping the stock gain 1.4%.That puts them back to the point of view they had until February.Does this flip flopping make you think “most of the investment industry is simply unnecessary,” as Al Lewis says? In that case you’ll enjoy this farewell column by Lewis.Getting back to Apple and Barclays…“We believe Tim Cook has solidified his strategy and re-gained the confidence of Apple stakeholders in many ways – reversing many of the warning signs we saw earlier in the year,” the Barclays analysts said in a note.MarketWatch’s Ben Eisen has more info on the upgrade here.Photo credit: ShutterstockThe trend is higher in the first couple of minutes of trading, with the Dow clearing 17,000.Dow +0.6% or 106 points — above 17,000S&P 500 +0.5%Nasdaq +0.6%The M&A news is boosting sentiment, and Citi /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed /quotes/nls/c C also could be cheering investors.The big bank premarket is gaining after a settlement and its earnings report.Citi said this morning that it’s agreed to pay $7 billion to settle allegations it sold shoddy mortgages in the run-up to the financial crisis.With its earnings report,  adjusted profit beat expectations and revenue also topped forecasts.

Stock market live blog: Risk-on day pushes Dow to intraday record; Tesla climbs, GoPro retreats	We’re live blogging all the action in the stock market on Monday. For a concise rundown of the day’s trading activity, see Market Snapshot.The gold market closed with sharp losses Monday, marking the biggest daily drop of the year. The August contract for gold futures was down 2.3%, or $30 at $1,307.10.Most are cautious on the yellow metal at the moment, bot not everyone. Bill Gunderson writes on MarketWatch’s Trading Deck that he’s buying gold stocks. Here’s why.One situation that’s getting louder in the usually-quiet world of municipal bonds is a thousand miles southeast of Florida. Puerto Rico is getting chaotic as the U.S. commonwealth sends signals that it may have to restructure some of the debt issued by its public agencies. Bond prices are dropping sharply amid all the uncertainty (Read: Widely held muni bond investment takes a big licking.)Much of the debt issued by Puerto Rico is guaranteed by bond insurance companies, which have been watching the situation on the island carefully. The insurers’ stocks aren’t looking too hot as a result. MBIA Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/233216/delayed /quotes/nls/mbi MBI , Assured Guaranty Ltd.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/345584/delayed /quotes/nls/ago AGO , and Radian Group Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/205031/delayed /quotes/nls/rdn RDN all posted gains on Monday, but they’re in the red for the year. MBIA is down 20% year to date, while Assured is down 1.7% ,and Radian is down 2%.Moody’s Investors Service warned that Puerto Rico’s troubles are a negative for the bond insurers.Goldman strategists have been doing some soul searching in recent weeks. First  they pull forward their timeline for Federal Reserve rate hikes. Then they lower their year-end Treasury yield target. Now they’re raising their 2014 forecast for the S&P 500 index.That last one has swung Goldman from among the most bearish to among the most bullish as far as Wall Street equity analysts go. They now expect the the S&P to climb to 2,050 by the end of the year. The full piece can be found here.Citigroup Inc.’s $7 billion payout for shoddy pre-crisis mortgage practices may be a bargain for the banking giant. MarketWatch’s Sital Patel breaks down the numbers to tell us that considering its top-line numbers, Citi generates the revenue needed to pay out those fines in just 34 days.But borrowers may benefit from this deal because the inking of another settlement means that banks can get back to actually lending, reports MarketWatch’s Ruth Mantell. Mortgage-buyers may find loans less restrictive than they were in the immediate wake of the financial crisis, though lending standards aren’t likely to return to pre-crisis levels any time soon.Citigroup shares traded up 3.1% on Monday at $48.45.For the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 25 of the 30 components are set to notch gains. The top performer is Visa Inc.  /quotes/zigman/502306/delayed /quotes/nls/v V , which is up 1.8% at $220.92. Its high price means it is a heavily weighted component, so it’s helping propel the 122-point push high in the index.The best performing stock in the S&P 500 index on Monday is Perrigo Co. PLC  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/26312784/delayed /quotes/nls/prgo PRGO , an over-the-counter pharmaceutical company. It’s up 5.6% at $154.39.Those share gains follow a report in Globes, an Israeli publication, that said the company is looking for a potential buyer who would pay a “good premium” over its $20 billion market cap. Because Perrigo was acquired by an Irish company, any buyer could transfer activity to Ireland to reduce its tax burden.The best-performing sectors in the S&P 500 so far Monday are information technology (up 0.89%) and energy (up 0.78%).Info tech stocks are led by Facebook Inc.  /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed /quotes/nls/fb FB (up 2.7%) and Micron Technology Inc.  /quotes/zigman/75433/delayed /quotes/nls/mu MU , up 2.3%.The energy sector is being led by Cimarex Energy Co.  /quotes/zigman/311672/delayed /quotes/nls/xec XEC  (up 1.8%) and EOG Resources Inc.  /quotes/zigman/248503/delayed /quotes/nls/eog EOG (up 1.74%).Rick Santelli, who many know as that CNBC reporter that reminds you the volume is too high on the television, just had his latest — and loudest? — meltdown.

If nothing else, we read this as a sign that investors are aware that stocks in the developed world are looking pricey.”Here’s a quick check on the indexes, with less than three hours to go in the session:S&P 500: up 9 points at 1,977DJIA: up 120 points at 17,064Nasdaq: Up 27 points at 4,442The Market Snapshot is fresh off the presses for your perusal.[Corrects mistaken stock prices.]Shares of GoPro Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/34007695/delayed /quotes/nls/gpro GPRO are down 4.8% on the day, following an article in Barron’s  over the weekend that said the wearable camera maker’s recent “thrill-filled IPO adventure may end badly.”Few seem to want to pull punches when talking about GoPro, at least if we’re judging by MarketWatch columnists. Take this one, from Trading Deck columnist Tom Lloyd Sr.: “GoPro has broken its fundamental moorings and is a hot IPO balloon that is moving higher until the hot air runs out.”You’ve doubtless heard about the decline in trading revenues among the big banks — a particularly timely topic given the glut of bank earnings this week. But there’s no more visceral image than an empty trading floor to give a sense of what this low volume market is doing to the banks. The Wall Street Journal has just that kind of story in its Monday edition:“UBS AG ’s trading floor in Stamford, Conn., once teemed with traders occupying a space equal to two football fields. The Guinness World Records recognized it as the biggest such facility on the planet. And the Swiss bank used it to showcase its Wall Street credentials….“Today, there are virtually no traders shouting into their phones or staring at terminals. UBS’s cavernous floor is taken up mostly by back-office, legal and technology staffers, according to people familiar with the bank.”The full story, by  Katy Burne, Justin Baer, and Saabira Chaudhuri, can be found here.Merger news and Citi’s settlement help take the Dow past 17,000. Adrienne Mitchell reports.Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s high yield researchers are out with a note Monday looking at how low yields have gotten in the junk bond space. While there’s lots of talk about whether the current high prices and low yields in the asset class can be maintained, the analysts, led by Michael Contopoulos, don’t see any changes on the horizon in the near-term.“According to our most recent credit investor survey, investors think that HY is overvalued, and have reduced their overweight positions. But at the same time they also expect credit spreads to grind tighter in the short term. We agree, as we think that the risk, in the absence of any rates volatility and exogenous shocks, is to the upside.”AAPLYour browser does not support iframes.Apple Inc .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed /quotes/nls/aapl AAPL  is getting a lot of love from analysts today. Analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley raised their price targets for the stock.Earlier, Barclays upgraded the stock to overweight from equal-weight and raised their price target to $110 from $95, citing a more optimistic outlook.Morgan Stanley raised it price target to $110 from $99, citing potential gains from the expected roll-out of a smartwatch, dubbed the iWatch.Shares are up 1.7%.Investors returned from the weekend in a buying mood. The market has “defied all odds,” according to CEO Vince Lowry of RevenueShares. He sees further gains in the second half, although he says a correction of between 5% and 10% would be healthy.Caution flags continue to wave for the markets as several put/call ratios and other indicators have hovered at long-term or all-time extremes for four straight weeks, says Randy Frederick, Managing Director of Trading and Derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.Frederick has been expecting a -3.5% to -5% pullback for the past few weeks, and all that’s been missing is a catalyst. This week, European data and Portuguese bank-induced market jitters just might play that role. Telsa Motors shares are up 4.6% at $228.29.

What to watch for in J.P. Morgan earnings	By Sital S. Patel, MarketWatchEarnings: The nation’s largest bank by assets is expected to report net income of $5.4 billion, or $1.29 per share, down from $6.5 billion, or $1.45 a share in the year-earlier period, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.Revenue: The bank is expected to report a decline in revenue. The consensus estimate is for $23.7 billion for the quarter, compared to $25.2 billion a year ago, according to FactSet.Stock reaction: The bank’s shares are down 3.3% for the year-to-date and are 8% below their 52-week high of $61.48. Shares have lagged the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund /quotes/zigman/246222/delayed/quotes/nls/xlf XLF +0.64% , which tracks financial stocks in the S&P 500 and is up 4.5% in the same period. Analysts have an average price target on the stock of $56.56, according to FactSet. J.P. Morgan /quotes/zigman/272085/delayed/quotes/nls/jpm JPM +1.22%  shares were up 1.4% in midday trading on Monday ahead of the results, after peer Citigroup Inc. /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C +3.17%   reported second-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations.Key issues: Jamie Dimon’s health. The J.P. Morgan chairman and chief executive stunned Wall Street earlier this month with news that he has throat cancer. Although he moved quickly to disclose the news, report that he is undergoing treatment and is expected to make a full recovery, investors will likely be keen to hear further assurances that he will remain engaged in the day-to-day running of the bank. The earnings release will be the bank’s first public event since his announcement. While Dimon currently has no clear successor , the board is focused on succession plans and is working on a three-year and five-to-seven-year plan, said a bank spokesman. In May, Dimon told investors he plans to stay at the bank for at least five more years, according to media reports.Trading slump: J.P. Morgan warned in May that second-quarter fixed-income and equities trading revenues would fall as much as 20%, as the environment remained challenging given lower client activity levels. In the first quarter, fixed-income trading declined 17%. At a June conference, CFO Marianne Lake hinted at pay and job cuts at the bank’s investment banking division, citing revenue pressures and slower trading conditions. There is “too much capacity” in the fixed-income area, which includes contracts tied to rates and currencies, she said.Barclays analysts are optimistic that outside of trading, the rest of the bank’s key franchises continued to gain traction, although they expect the recent increase in M&A activity to show up in fee income later in the year. Barclays is expecting the bank’s legal issues to have waned, after it paid $13 billion to the U.S. authorities in 2013 to settle charges of selling shoddy mortgage securities to investors in the years before the crisis.The road ahead: Barclays is expecting the bank to offer a positive outlook for the rest of the year, with continued balance sheet growth, an ability to better manage its net interest margin, a solid investment banking backlog, a focus on expenses, asset quality and more share buybacks.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=4B981766-0B7B-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14
Intel may see mild earnings, sales gains	By Rex Crum, MarketWatchEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet estimate that Intel /quotes/zigman/20392/delayed/quotes/nls/intc INTC +0.42%  will earn 52 cents a share, up from 39 cents a share in the same period a year ago.Revenue: Intel is forecast to report revenue for the second quarter, which ended in June, of $13.7 billion, compared with $12.8 billion a year ago. The company itself has forecast revenue in a range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion.Stock performance: In terms of its stock price, 2014 has been a good year for Intel. The company’s shares reached a 52-week-high of $31.58 on Monday, and are up about 21.5% for the year.Other matters: Technology research firm Gartner Inc. said last week that the PC market, which remains Intel’s bread and butter, showed slight growth in the second quarter, putting an end to two years of declines. Any gains in overall PC sales should give Intel some reason to feel good about its prospects.Analyst Doug Freeman, of RBC Capital Markets, said he is looking for “strong September quarter” guidance from Intel, which may still end up being below its historically seasonal rates.“At this point, we consider Intel to be a company in transition as focus of growing into new markets likely proves to be mission critical,” Freedman said.Apple among broad tech-sector gainersMorgan Stanley sees Apple getting a boost from “iWatch”EBay, Sotheby’s team up on online auctions	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=09F35218-0B75-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14
SEC charges Ernst & Young with violating auditor independence	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ernst & Young on Monday with breaking auditor independence rules. The SEC said a subsidiary of the company lobbied congressional staff of behalf of two audit clients. Such lobbying activities are prohibited since they put the firm in the position of being an advocate for audit clients. Ernst & Young agreed to pay more than $4 million to settle the charges. No lawmaker was named by the SEC.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8F11A591-3A4F-4139-99D6-BDCD9A803088&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Why I am buying gold stocks right now	By Bill GundersonGold stocks in general have underperformed the market the last few years. Looking at the historical performance of the SPDR Gold Shares ETF /quotes/zigman/41663/delayed/quotes/nls/gld GLD -2.38%  as a proxy for gold stocks, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 Index on a three- and five-year basis. Last year, while the U.S. stock markets were on a tear, gold stocks declined more than 28%...............Data from Best Stocks Now appHowever, given the increased geopolitical risk in the world, particularly in the Middle East and the Ukraine, gold stocks are starting to move up in my rankings, and there are several names that I am starting to warm up to.One name that looks interesting to me is Randgold Resources /quotes/zigman/88377/delayed/quotes/nls/gold GOLD -3.20% . As you can see from the chart below, the stock just recently broke out to the upside.Randgold Resources Ltd. is a British ADR headquartered in St. Helier, Channel Islands. Randgold explores and develops gold deposits in sub-Saharan West Africa. Despite some investors’ wariness about investing in Africa, West Africa has been a very stable mining jurisdiction and has a lot of unexplored lands which contain high-grade gold deposits.The company is also very focused on profitability and low-cost production. Unlike many of its peers, Randgold did not have to write down any of its reserves in 2013 given its more conservative price projections . It also has no debt and has been prudent with its acquisitions. These superior management traits have resulted in strong performance relative to its gold stock peers.So lets take a closer look.Best Stocks Now analysis..............Data from Best Stocks Now appRandgold Resources is a mid-cap stock with a market capitalization of $8 billion. On a valuation basis, the stock has a trailing P/E of 29 and a forward P/E of 19 which makes it look expensive, but keep in mind that valuation is based on a low earnings base which is likely to improve should gold prices continue to increase. But for now, Randgold has a Value Grade of “D-.”..............Data from Best Stocks Now app	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=71D0A607-1B2E-4D10-9835-97E7E57D1A11&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Yahoo: Focus on Alibaba, display business	By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatchEarnings: The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Web portal is expected to report a profit of 38 cents a share, compared with a net income of 35 cents a share in the year-earlier period.Revenue: Yahoo /quotes/zigman/59898/delayed/quotes/nls/yhoo YHOO +0.72%  is seen reporting revenue of $1.08 billion, up slightly from sales of $1.07 billion the same period last year.Stock react: Yahoo shares jumped in April after the company reported an improvement in its core business and better-than-expected results from Alibaba, the Chinese Internet giant in which the company owns a 24% stake. Alibaba is expected to go public later this year.Key areas to watch: With Alibaba set to go public, investors will be mainly focused on comments from Yahoo management on what it plans to do with the expected cash haul from the Chinese Internet giant’s offering.Any signal that Yahoo plans to return a big chunk of that cash to shareholders would be greeted favorably by Wall Street, analysts say. On the other hand, Yahoo management, led by Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, could also point to more acquisitions as the company pushes forward with an ambitious turnaround strategy.Then again, Yahoo could simply stay silent on its Alibaba plan, says B. Riley analyst Sameet Sinha.“With the IPO imminent, the question will be about use of the proceeds,” Sinha told clients in a Monday note. “We do not think Yahoo management will lay out a plan as yet for the proceeds which could disappoint investors.”On the other hand, Yahoo could get its investors excited by pointing to continued improvement in its core business, particularly in display ads. Upbeat results from its main businesses could convince investors that there’s more value in Yahoo beyond Alibaba.Yahoo acquired video-streaming company RayVAlibaba points to richer valuation; Yahoo rises	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=DEFA2450-0B6B-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Goldman Sachs earnings: Bond trading, M&A fees to be focus	By Sital S. Patel, MarketWatchEarnings: The investment bank is expected to report second-quarter earnings of $1.49 billion, or $3.05 a share, down from $1.86 billion, or $3.70 a share, in the same period a year ago, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.Revenue: Goldman Sachs /quotes/zigman/188479/delayed/quotes/nls/gs GS +1.39% is also expected to report a decline in revenue. The consensus estimate is for $7.97 billion for the quarter, compared to $8.61 billion a year ago.Stock reaction: Shares are down 6% year-to-date and are 7% below their 52-week high of $181.13. They have lagged the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund /quotes/zigman/246222/delayed/quotes/nls/xlf XLF +0.62% , which tracks financial stocks in the S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.48%  and is up 4.5% year-to-date. Analysts have an average price target on the stock of $166.83, according to FactSet. Goldman Sachs shares were up 1.2% in afternoon trading on Monday ahead of the release.Key issues: Investors will closely watch revenue from the bank’s FICC business, or fixed income, currency and commodities, which comprises a substantial part of the firm’s overall revenues. The FICC business fell 11% in the first quarter amid low volumes and volatility. While peers, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. /quotes/zigman/272085/delayed/quotes/nls/jpm JPM +0.84% and Citigroup Inc. /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C +3.06% , have warned that the slump in FICC has continued, Goldman has been more upbeat, describing the trend as cyclical and predicting that revenues will come back in the longer term.Analyst Brad Hintz of BernsteinResearch recently cut his rating on the stock to market perform from outperform, citing weakness in trading revenues. “Yeah, they’re a winner, but over the next two years, it’s tough to make an argument that we’re going to see that winning occur,” said Hintz. However, the bank’s core investment banking unit is expected to continue to see growth, especially given the recent uptick in M&A activity and strong debt and equity issuance, some of which is expected to bolster fee income later in the year.Regulatory issues: Investors will be waiting to hear more about Goldman’s regulatory and legal issues, after the SEC recently expanded a probe of hiring practices in Asia. The firm was recently fined $800,000 over mis-priced trades in its dark pools, private stock-trading venues that have come under increased scrutiny from regulators. The bank is considering closing its dark pool, known as Sigma X, The Wall Street Journal reported in April.In May, the bank announced it had put its metals warehouse business, Metro International Trade Services LLC, up for sale, also due to greater regulatory oversight of Wall Street banks that own physical commodities.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CF0BBC88-0B80-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Intel may see modest earnings, sales gains	By Rex Crum, MarketWatchEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet estimate that Intel /quotes/zigman/20392/delayed/quotes/nls/intc INTC +0.77%  will earn 52 cents a share, up from 39 cents a share in the same period a year ago.Revenue: Intel is forecast to report revenue for the quarter, which ended in June, of $13.7 billion, compared with $12.8 billion a year ago. The company itself has forecast revenue in a range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion.Stock performance: In terms of its stock price, 2014 has been a good year for Intel. The company’s shares reached a 52-week-high of $31.58 on Monday, and are up about 21.5% for the year.Other matters: Technology research firm Gartner Inc. said last week that the PC market, which remains Intel’s bread and butter, showed slight growth in the second quarter, putting an end to two years of declines. Any gains in overall PC sales should give Intel some reason to feel good about its prospects.Analyst Doug Freeman, of RBC Capital Markets, said he is looking for “strong September quarter” guidance from Intel, which may still end up being below its historically seasonal rates.“At this point, we consider Intel to be a company in transition as focus of growing into new markets likely proves to be mission critical,” Freedman said.Apple among broad tech-sector gainersMorgan Stanley sees Apple getting a boost from “iWatch”EBay, Sotheby’s team up on online auctions	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=09F35218-0B75-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14
Oil settles slightly higher in choppy trade	By Anora Mahmudova and William L. Watts, MarketWatchOn the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for delivery in August /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 +0.24%   settled 8 cents, or 0.1%, higher at $100.91 a barrel. August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 +0.16%  on London’s ICE Futures exchange rose 12 cents, or 0.1%, to $107.35 a barrel.Oil futures tumbled last week on confirmation violence in Iraq has had little impact on the country’s oil output, while the Libyan government resumed control of a pair of oil terminals that had been occupied by rebels for several months.Over the weekend, however, the Brega oil port in Libya’s east was shut by protesters, an oil official said, while Iraq’s parliament failed to agree on a new speaker, prolonging a political impasse.“Given that the three-week drop has taken the price of Brent oil below the levels it was trading before the situation in Iraq caused it to spike, there’s a possibility that the selling may have been overdone and that some gains could be on the way, perhaps as early as this week,” said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at Forex.com, in a note.In energy products markets, August natural gas /quotes/zigman/2308008/delayed NGQ14 +0.22%  were unchanged at $4.15 per million British thermal units. August gasoline futures /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 +0.67%  rose 2 cents, or 0.7%, to $2.93 a gallon, while August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821453/delayed HOQ4 -0.35%  rose 1 cents, or 0.4%, to $2.87 a gallon.Meanwhile, trading volume and open interest for Nymex Brent on Friday was the highest ever, CME said Monday.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Chinese man builds own Tesla-charging networkSheldon Adelson, Warren Buffett agree on one thing10 cars Americans don’t want to buy	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=6FEBD7BC-0B2E-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

Stocks end with solid gains, but Dow cant hang on for record close: live blog recap	We’re live blogging all the action in the stock market on Monday. For a concise rundown of the day’s trading activity, see Market Snapshot.Good morning.Stock futures are pointing to a higher open today for Wall Street, which lost ground last week but did end on a positive note with a gain Friday.The S&P 500 lost 0.9% last week, paring its loss Friday by rising 0.2%.Photo credit: Getty ImagesIt’s another Merger Monday, with plenty of companies saying they’re getting hitched over the weekend and before the open.Shire /quotes/zigman/66975/delayed /quotes/nls/shpg SHPG said it’s received a new takeover offer from AbbVie /quotes/zigman/13067932/delayed /quotes/nls/abbv ABBV , and it’s willing to recommend this deal, valued at more than $53 billion, to its shareholders.Mylan /quotes/zigman/75764/delayed /quotes/nls/myl MYL said it will buy Abbott Labs’ /quotes/zigman/216393/delayed /quotes/nls/abt ABT developed markets branded generics business in a $5.3 billion deal.Both of these deals are tax-inversion moves, where U.S.-based firms move their HQs to other climes for tax reasons.Read more about today’s deals and jumpiest stocks in the Movers & Shakers column.Photo credit: Shutterstock.comThe M&A news is boosting sentiment, and Citi /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed /quotes/nls/c C also could be cheering investors.The big bank premarket is gaining after a settlement and its earnings report.Citi said this morning that it’s agreed to pay $7 billion to settle allegations it sold shoddy mortgages in the run-up to the financial crisis.With its earnings report,  adjusted profit beat expectations and revenue also topped forecasts. On a nonadjusted basis, profit plunged as that big settlement weighed.The trend is higher in the first couple of minutes of trading, with the Dow clearing 17,000.Dow +0.6% or 106 points — above 17,000S&P 500 +0.5%Nasdaq +0.6%Last week, Barclays analysts were saying you shouldn’t overweight the world’s largest company by market cap.Today, they’ve changed their tune, upgrading Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed /quotes/nls/aapl AAPL to overweight and helping the stock gain 1.4%.That puts them back to the point of view they had until February.Does this flip flopping make you think “most of the investment industry is simply unnecessary,” as Al Lewis says? In that case you’ll enjoy this farewell column by Lewis.Getting back to Apple and Barclays…“We believe Tim Cook has solidified his strategy and re-gained the confidence of Apple stakeholders in many ways – reversing many of the warning signs we saw earlier in the year,” the Barclays analysts said in a note.MarketWatch’s Ben Eisen has more info on the upgrade here.Photo credit: ShutterstockIn the last couple of minutes, the Dow has scored a new intraday record and topped its prior record close…The Dow has traded as high as 17,085 in the last few minutes, according to FactSet data.The blue-chip barometer was last at 17,076.Its prior intraday record was 17,074.65 — hit on July 3.The Dow’s previous record close was 17,068.26 — also achieved July 3.Photo credit: Getty ImagesThe Dow Jones Industrial Average apparently does not realize that it’s on the wrong side of history.That’s a reference to a column by MarketWatch’s David Weidner.He’s skeptical about the bull market at this point, saying stocks are “squarely out of step.”Read more hereCiti /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed /quotes/nls/c C has edged down from its session high but the stock is basically holding its gain — up 3.3% at last check.MarketWatch’s Sital Patel is live blogging Citi’s quarterly earnings conference call.Go here to follow along.Photo credit: BloombergGoldman Sachs has raised its year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 2050 from 1900.MarketWatch’s Ben Eisen has more on Goldman’s view, which the bank outlined in a note dated Friday.So now instead of predicting a slide to 1900 from 1978 (where the S&P stood at last check), Goldman’s forecast implies a 3.6% gain from the current level to 2050 by New Year’s Eve.Here’s an interesting number tied to Barclays and its recommendations on Apple’s stock: +25%.The bank downgraded the iPhone maker on Feb. 20, then Apple rallied 25% as of Friday’s close before Barclays switched back to overweight this morning.Apple’s shares “may stick close to a trading range for the next year or so” — that was Barclays’ now-obviously-incorrect view back in February.Todd Salamone, senior vice-president of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research said sideways trading is more likely than a massive rally or sell-off in the next few weeks. “The good news for bulls is that a lot of people are expecting bad news, such as a 10% corrections. Investors have been hedging for such an event, as we see from a spike in VIX call options.Because investors hedged their portfolios, we are unlikely to see panic selling when negative news hits equities.“Lack of volatility is not a sign of complacency, rather fear is creating lack of volatility.”Lindt gobbles up Russell Stover. And The Dow Jones Industrial Average has reclaimed 17-thousand. MarketWatch’s Ann Cates reports.MarketWatch’s Victor Reklaitis joins Paul Vigna on the News Hub with three key stocks to watch today, including Apple, Shire and Mylan. Photo: Getty As investors push stocks into record territory, traders are dumping gold.August gold futures are down more than 2%, leaving it on track for the biggest daily drop for the yellow metal since December.Many analysts are putting the move down to profit taking on the back of a six week rally that was supported in part by turmoil in Iraq and the Middle East. Now, with stocks making new highs, gold has lost a bit of its safe-haven sheen, they argue. Lackluster physical demand doesn’t help. Stocks are firmly in the green and if the Dow Industrials closes at this level, it will be a record.S&P 500 .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX  +0.57%Dow .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA  +0.77%Nasdaq .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP  +0.70%Russell 2000 .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/2759624/delayed RUT  +0.77%Telsa Motors shares are up 4.6% at $228.29. We think shares are reacting to news from China – as in, Beijing has mandated that a big chunk of government-purchased cars be electric vehicles. (Via Barrons ).On Saturday, China posted new rules that would require at least 30% of government auto purchases to be electric vehicles. Caution flags continue to wave for the markets as several put/call ratios and other indicators have hovered at long-term or all-time extremes for four straight weeks, says Randy Frederick, Managing Director of Trading and Derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.Frederick has been expecting a -3.5% to -5% pullback for the past few weeks, and all that’s been missing is a catalyst. This week, European data and Portuguese bank-induced market jitters just might play that role. Investors returned from the weekend in a buying mood. The market has “defied all odds,” according to CEO Vince Lowry of RevenueShares. He sees further gains in the second half, although he says a correction of between 5% and 10% would be healthy.AAPLYour browser does not support iframes.Apple Inc .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed /quotes/nls/aapl AAPL  is getting a lot of love from analysts today. Analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley raised their price targets for the stock.Earlier, Barclays upgraded the stock to overweight from equal-weight and raised their price target to $110 from $95, citing a more optimistic outlook.Morgan Stanley raised it price target to $110 from $99, citing potential gains from the expected roll-out of a smartwatch, dubbed the iWatch.Shares are up 1.7%.Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s high yield researchers are out with a note Monday looking at how low yields have gotten in the junk bond space. While there’s lots of talk about whether the current high prices and low yields in the asset class can be maintained, the analysts, led by Michael Contopoulos, don’t see any changes on the horizon in the near-term.“According to our most recent credit investor survey, investors think that HY is overvalued, and have reduced their overweight positions. But at the same time they also expect credit spreads to grind tighter in the short term. We agree, as we think that the risk, in the absence of any rates volatility and exogenous shocks, is to the upside.”Merger news and Citi’s settlement help take the Dow past 17,000. Adrienne Mitchell reports.You’ve doubtless heard about the decline in trading revenues among the big banks — a particularly timely topic given the glut of bank earnings this week. But there’s no more visceral image than an empty trading floor to give a sense of what this low volume market is doing to the banks. The Wall Street Journal has just that kind of story in its Monday edition:“UBS AG ’s trading floor in Stamford, Conn., once teemed with traders occupying a space equal to two football fields. The Guinness World Records recognized it as the biggest such facility on the planet. And the Swiss bank used it to showcase its Wall Street credentials….“Today, there are virtually no traders shouting into their phones or staring at terminals. UBS’s cavernous floor is taken up mostly by back-office, legal and technology staffers, according to people familiar with the bank.”The full story, by  Katy Burne, Justin Baer, and Saabira Chaudhuri, can be found here.Shares of GoPro Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/34007695/delayed /quotes/nls/gpro GPRO are down 4.8% on the day, following an article in Barron’s  over the weekend that said the wearable camera maker’s recent “thrill-filled IPO adventure may end badly.”Few seem to want to pull punches when talking about GoPro, at least if we’re judging by MarketWatch columnists. Take this one, from Trading Deck columnist Tom Lloyd Sr.: “GoPro has broken its fundamental moorings and is a hot IPO balloon that is moving higher until the hot air runs out.”Here’s a quick check on the indexes, with less than three hours to go in the session:S&P 500: up 9 points at 1,977DJIA: up 120 points at 17,064Nasdaq: Up 27 points at 4,442The Market Snapshot is fresh off the presses for your perusal.[Corrects mistaken stock prices.]Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, thinks that “a big multi-year advance has left stock valuations stretched, and as a consequence, vulnerable to bad news.” Here’s his insight on where to find value“In a world in which stretched valuations leave stocks dependent on the Fed’s cheap money policies and vulnerable to bad news, we’d continue to emphasize a value bias. For domestic stocks, this suggests leaning toward large- and mega-cap names, which have outperformed small caps by roughly 6% year-to-date. Outside of the United States, investors, particularly those with little exposure, should take another look to emerging markets (EM) stocks. Since the April lows, EM stocks have modestly outperformed developed markets and inflows continue. For the week ended July 9, EM equities garnered another $1.4 billion. If nothing else, we read this as a sign that investors are aware that stocks in the developed world are looking pricey.”Rick Santelli, who many know as that CNBC reporter that reminds you the volume is too high on the television, just had his latest — and loudest? — meltdown. Santelli, who reports from the Chicago Board of Trade, got into a fight with economics reporter Steve Liesman on CNBC, which deteriorated into Santelli’s own special brand of commentary about how the Federal Reserve has stifled the market of all ability to express itself — or something like that.MarketWatch’s Steve Goldstein has your write-up here.The best-performing sectors in the S&P 500 so far Monday are information technology (up 0.89%) and energy (up 0.78%).Info tech stocks are led by Facebook Inc.  /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed /quotes/nls/fb FB (up 2.7%) and Micron Technology Inc.  /quotes/zigman/75433/delayed /quotes/nls/mu MU , up 2.3%.The energy sector is being led by Cimarex Energy Co.  /quotes/zigman/311672/delayed /quotes/nls/xec XEC  (up 1.8%) and EOG Resources Inc.  /quotes/zigman/248503/delayed /quotes/nls/eog EOG (up 1.74%).The best performing stock in the S&P 500 index on Monday is Perrigo Co. PLC  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/26312784/delayed /quotes/nls/prgo PRGO , an over-the-counter pharmaceutical company. It’s up 5.6% at $154.39.Those share gains follow a report in Globes, an Israeli publication, that said the company is looking for a potential buyer who would pay a “good premium” over its $20 billion market cap. Because Perrigo was acquired by an Irish company, any buyer could transfer activity to Ireland to reduce its tax burden.For the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 25 of the 30 components are set to notch gains. The top performer is Visa Inc.  /quotes/zigman/502306/delayed /quotes/nls/v V , which is up 1.8% at $220.92. Its high price means it is a heavily weighted component, so it’s helping propel the 122-point push high in the index.Citigroup Inc.’s $7 billion payout for shoddy pre-crisis mortgage practices may be a bargain for the banking giant. MarketWatch’s Sital Patel breaks down the numbers to tell us that considering its top-line numbers, Citi generates the revenue needed to pay out those fines in just 34 days.But borrowers may benefit from this deal because the inking of another settlement means that banks can get back to actually lending, reports MarketWatch’s Ruth Mantell. Mortgage-buyers may find loans less restrictive than they were in the immediate wake of the financial crisis, though lending standards aren’t likely to return to pre-crisis levels any time soon.Citigroup shares traded up 3.1% on Monday at $48.45.Goldman strategists have been doing some soul searching in recent weeks. First  they pull forward their timeline for Federal Reserve rate hikes. Then they lower their year-end Treasury yield target. Now they’re raising their 2014 forecast for the S&P 500 index.That last one has swung Goldman from among the most bearish to among the most bullish as far as Wall Street equity analysts go. They now expect the the S&P to climb to 2,050 by the end of the year. The full piece can be found here.One situation that’s getting louder in the usually-quiet world of municipal bonds is a thousand miles southeast of Florida. Puerto Rico is getting chaotic as the U.S. commonwealth sends signals that it may have to restructure some of the debt issued by its public agencies. Bond prices are dropping sharply amid all the uncertainty (Read: Widely held muni bond investment takes a big licking.)Much of the debt issued by Puerto Rico is guaranteed by bond insurance companies, which have been watching the situation on the island carefully.

EBay’s results will be shrouded by security breach	By Rex Crum, MarketWatchEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet estimate eBay /quotes/zigman/76117/delayed/quotes/nls/ebay EBAY -0.66%  will earn 68 cents a share, excluding one-time items, compared with a profit of 63 cents a share in the same period a year ago. EBay itself has forecast earnings of between 67 cents and 69 cents a share.Revenue: EBay is forecast to report sales of $4.39 billion, up from $3.88 billion in the second quarter of 2013. The company estimates its second-quarter sales will be in a range of $4.33 billion to $4.43 billion.Stock performance: For the year-to-date, eBay’s shares are down nearly 7%, closing Monday at $51.16. Since reaching a 52-week-high of $59.70 on Feb. 28, eBay’s stock has given up more than 13%.Other matters: Youssef Squali, who covers eBay for Cantor Fitzgerald, said the company’s results will likely be “tainted” by the effects of a hacking attack that eBay said occurred “between late February and early March.” When eBay acknowledged the matter in May, the company urged all of its customers to change their eBay account passwords.Additionally, Squali said eBay’s results may have been affected by changes Google /quotes/zigman/93888/delayed/quotes/nls/googl GOOGL +1.30%  made in May to its Panda algorithm, which is designed to keep poorer-quality sites from getting into Google’s to search results.“While we view these issues as transitory, we believe that if [eBay’s] core Marketplaces business remains sluggish, casting doubt over management’s ability to hit its already-reduced 2015 guidance, then shareholders’ pressure to unlock value either through [at least a partial] PayPal spin-off or sale of the entire company will intensify.”More must-read tech news from MarketWatch:Nadella sets bold new course for MicrosoftGoogle’s received more than 70K right-to-be-forgotten requestsPC sales record slight growth in second quarter	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0CF753AC-090D-11E4-B07D-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-14

States that workers want to escape from the most	By Catey Hill, MarketWatchAccording to data released Tuesday by job search site Indeed.com , some states have a much higher percentage of workers who are looking for employment outside of their state’s lines than others. Indeed, 56% of job seekers in Washington, D.C., 47.8% in Wyoming, 46.8% in West Virginia, 46.5% in North Dakota and 44.6% in New Hampshire are looking for work in another state (these are the top five states in terms of percentage of job seekers looking for work outside of states lines), the survey revealed. That’s compared with just 27.8% of people who are doing this nationwide. Meanwhile, job seekers in Texas (18.8%), Florida (19.3%), Michigan (22.2%), California (2.2%) and Georgia (23.2%) are the least likely to be seeking jobs out of state. The survey looked at the search data on Indeed.com from May 2013 to April 2014; the researchers defined a cross-border job seeker as someone who, based on their IP address, was searching for jobs using a different state name than the one he was located in.So what’s driving these job seekers to look elsewhere? In general, the local economy, not surprisingly, is the top reason people look elsewhere for jobs, explains Tara Sinclair, one of the researchers on the report. And people tend to look for jobs in larger states more often than smaller ones. Plus, the larger the share of the population with a bachelor’s degree and the higher the median income and home values in that state, the higher the percentage of people seeking work outside of state lines. And when the weather is cold (like this winter), there are jumps among those in colder-weather states in job searches to warm areas, Sinclair says.There are also variations from state to state: Residents of Washington, D.C., for example, likely look in surrounding areas more often because the D.C. area is so tiny and so easily commutable to other areas, she says. And the types of jobs people search for in other states vary as well: California is a hotbed for IT and nursing job searches, while New York is popular for accounting jobs.There are some states that job seekers are far more likely to look in than others. More job seekers look for employment in Texas than any other state; that’s followed by Florida, California, New York and Georgia. Meanwhile, job seekers are least likely to look for employment in South Dakota, Rhode Island, Wyoming, Vermont and New Mexico. There is also a strong regional effect with job seekers tending to look for jobs in neighboring states. “They like it because they can still drive home and still see relatives relatively easily,” says Sinclair.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0F858120-0B8D-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
China’s bevy of supercomputers goes unused	By Laura He, MarketWatchBut it seems a lot of these massive machines, usually made with large government investment, lie idle after they are made, or are even abandoned midway, due to fundamental defects in China’s traditional bureaucratic management system.China’s supercomputers have a very low utilization rate, according to a report Monday on the NetEase /quotes/zigman/83280/delayed/quotes/nls/ntes NTES +2.16%   news portal site, quoting research from the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences as saying.Less than 20% of China’s supercomputers have actually been used for scientific research, while outside of government agencies and academia, 6 of the 11 supercomputers used by the information-technology sector serve online gaming companies, the report said.In fact, even one of China’s most expensive supercomputing projects is going to waste. The Tianhe-1 — “Tianhe meaning “Milky Way” in Chinese — was the world’s fastest supercomputer when it was built in 2009, but since last year it had since been “sealed up” and lies idle, according to another recent report by the state-run Modern Express newspaper.“The ceiling of the equipment room has already gone moldy, and the air conditioner’s condenser is leaking water,” the report said, adding that both gates of the supercomputer center and the host-computer building, located in the central China city of Changsha, had been sealed up.The Chinese government had invested 860 million yuan ($138 million) in building the Changsha National Supercomputer Center which hosts the Tianhe-1, but the report suggested that the supercomputer has sat unused since 2013 due to bureaucracy.The Hunan provincial government built the Tianhe-1 and was expected to hand it over to Hunan University, but a disagreement between the two parties delayed the transfer.“We couldn’t hand over the project as there was no ‘clear’ organization to receive this project at that time. Then the builder took over the basic maintenance of the supercomputer,” an official from the Hunan provincial government told the newspaper without elaborating on the nature of disagreement.The Hunan government has since replied to the latest request from Hunan University and said they would “speed up the paperwork” and try to complete the handover later this month or early in August, the report said.In the meantime, China continues to churn out supercomputers, increasing its global share of the giant electronic brains to 15% — or 76 of the world’s 500 fastest supercomputers — to rank second among all nations.By comparison, the U.S. is still the leader, with 233 out of the top 500, but its share of the global total has dipped 6 percentage points since November 2013.And China also boasts the world’s most powerful computer, the Tianhe-2, rated at 33.86 petaflops (quadrillions of calculations per second), according to latest statistics released by the International Supercomputing Conference in June.Whether it will get more use than its predecessor, however, remains to be seen.Alibaba pushes further into entertainment with Lions Gate dealEven by his own standards, CNBC personality Rick Santelli has a bit of a meltdownChina’s foreign direct investment barely grows	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5AB8E88C-0BDB-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
Dollar steady against yen as BOJ stands pat on policy	By Alexander MartinMarket participants will now be focusing on BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda’s news conference from 0630 GMT and Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen’s testimony later in the global day.The BOJ slightly cut its growth outlook in a new projection, but kept its policy on hold and maintained a bullish consumer-price forecast, suggesting officials feel little urgency to add to their aggressive stimulus measures.“I don’t think we should be expecting any change in Mr. Kuroda’s stance at his news conference,” said Junichi Ishikawa, market analyst at IG Securities. He tipped the greenback to stay in a ¥101.20-¥101.85 range for the rest of the Asian trading day.The dollar /quotes/zigman/4868099/realtime/sampled USDJPY +0.0281% most recently traded at ¥101.59 from ¥101.55 late New York trading Monday.Officials have so far played down the need for further action, saying they are on track to meet their target of 2% inflation by next year, even as Japan’s economy shows signs of stress following a national sales tax increase to 8% from 5% that took effect April 1.Osamu Takashima, chief FX strategist at Citigroup Global Markets Japan, said the trend over the past six months was to see the dollar/yen weaken following Gov. Kuroda’s news conferences.“Some short-term investors are looking to go long the yen on expectations Mr. Kuroda would say something optimistic” about the state of the economy, he said.But given the rapid worsening in machinery orders data released last week, possibly signaling an economic slowdown following the April sales tax increase, Mr. Kuroda is unlikely to reiterate his optimistic views on the economy, he said.“This time around, I think the risk is more toward a weaker yen,” he added.He also said he doesn’t expect hawkish comments from Ms. Yellen at the congressional testimony on monetary policy and the economy, thus limiting the dollar/yen’s upside to the 200-day moving average around ¥101.90.The euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/realtime/sampled EURUSD -0.0018%  was at $1.3617 from $1.3619 and at /quotes/zigman/4868097/realtime/sampled EURJPY +0.0236%  ¥138.35 from ¥138.28.The WSJ Dollar Index /quotes/zigman/9625991/realtime XX:BUXX +0.07% , a measure of the dollar against a basket of major currencies, was up 0.033% at 72.872.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Bank of Japan trims growth forecast, holds policy steadyWhy gold just posted its biggest drop this year	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=6A65BF10-0BE7-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
Gold inches back from 2014’s biggest drop	By Shawn Langlois, MarketWatchAt last check, gold for August delivery /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.24%  was up $3.40 to $1,310.10 an ounce. On Tuesday, however, prices took their hardest hit of the year, dropping 2.3% amid an investor rush into equities. No real demand for a safe haven when Dow is distancing itself from 17,000.September silver /quotes/zigman/12294966/delayed SIU4 +0.39%  also rose, perking up by 5 cents to $20.96 an ounce.Evan Lucas of IG Markets says that a strong earnings season is shaping up, and that will continue to weigh on gold prices going forward.“Yes, the bears will point to estimates being low-ball and the market is likely to discount the results somewhat,” he said. “However, the signs are that the U.S. is standing on its own two feet after so much fiscal support.”Investors will get a clearer picture on that front throughout Tuesday’s session, with the testimony from Janet Yellen due out at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. Before that, retail sales for June and the NY Fed Empire manufacturing survey for July will be released.Elsewhere in metals trading, October platinum /quotes/zigman/19534176/delayed PLV4 -0.34%  rose $7.20, or 0.5%, to $1,500.30 an ounce, while September palladium /quotes/zigman/18010104/delayed PAU4 +0.37%  tacked on $1 to $873 an ounce.

Israel accepts Gaza cease-fire plan	By Nicholas CaseyThe brief Israeli announcement was made just minutes before the proposed start of the cease-fire, which Israel said would take effect at 9 a.m. local time.However, in a statement released before Israel’s acceptance, the military wing of Hamas said it didn’t accept any plan to stop fighting. “For us, it is not worth the ink that wrote it,” the group said. “Our battle with the enemy is to be continued, and we’ll be loyal to the blood of the martyrs.”The Egyptian proposal, unveiled Monday night, calls for a de-escalation of the fighting, with the aim of total calm 12 hours later. Israel would halt air and naval bombardment of Gaza and refrain from launching a threatened ground offensive, in exchange for Hamas and other Palestinian factions in Gaza holding their rocket fire, the proposal said.An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.comMore must-reads from MarketWatch:Are stock-crash conditions now growing or fading?Why ‘Dr. Doom’ Marc Faber is sticking to his stock-swoon callWhy gold just posted its biggest drop this year	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F59F5370-0BF6-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Germany has experienced a slight dent in economic activity recently -- retail sales declined and industrial production as well as incoming orders dropped, said ZEW President Clemens Fuest in the release. The weak German data come after a recent string of disappointing news from the euro zone, adding to concerns that growth in both Europes economic powerhouse and the currency union is stalling.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=EB50F9C8-CC18-4B38-8A6E-7C6C2E1E47C8&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Debt purchases are within ECB’s mandate: Draghi	By Brian Blackstone and Todd BuellDraghi’s remarks, at a hearing at a newly formed European parliament that met in Strasbourg, France, are the latest indication that the ECB is open to additional aggressive stimulus measure if they are needed to keep inflation from staying too low for too long.He said the ECB’s ultralow interest rates — the ECB cut them to record lows last month and installed a negative rate on bank deposits at the central bank, the largest institution to do so — haven’t fueled asset bubbles but warned of “frothy” conditions in the housing markets of some euro-area countries.Regulatory policies are the primary defense against such risks, Draghi said, adding that monetary policy isn’t the right instrument to use at a time of low inflation.His remarks came hours after the International Monetary Fund renewed its calls for the ECB to consider big asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, to revive lending in the euro zone and keep ultralow inflation from damaging the bloc’s recovery.“QE falls squarely in our mandate,” Draghi told parliamentarians.An extended version of this article appears at WSJ.com.More from MarketWatch:ECB liquidity plan to be reflected in euro: reportU.K. inflation rises in June, close to BOE targetUnivision becomes takeover bait amid World Cup	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=D7927DDE-0BFC-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
You can feel free and ignore Yellen’s talk today	By Rex Nutting, MarketWatchWe already know what she’s going to say because, these days, the Federal Reserve can barely shut up about what it thinks and what it plans to do. These days, Yellen has plenty of other opportunities to explain herself and the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee; the Fed chairwoman doesn’t need to wait for her ritual appearances in front of the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee.Yellen holds press conferences and conducts on-the-record interviews. The FOMC itself releases a long explanation after each meeting, and includes detailed forecasts and assumptions about the course of the economy every quarter. We even have a “dot plot” showing where each member thinks the federal funds rate will be years from now.It wasn’t always this way. It used to be that the Fed was a black box, and no one really knew what went on inside. No one even knew that the Fed had raised or lowered the federal funds rate until days later when the market figured it out on its own.To counter that secrecy, the Congress passed a law to require the Fed head to appear before Congress twice a year to explain himself or herself. The requirement was part of the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act of 1978, which is why the testimony was called Humphrey-Hawkins for so long.For years, Fed chairmen like Alan Greenspan, Paul Volcker and William Miller used their Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to send messages to the markets. The release of the chairman’s testimony to the news wires, the publication of the FOMC’s official forecasts and the chairman’s ad hoc replies to questions consumed the attention of the bond market, the stock market and the currency market.Humphrey-Hawkins Day was often one of the biggest days of the year in the markets, as the new information in the testimony forced traders and investors to completely revise their thinking about what the Fed would do.Greenspan was the master of using Humphrey-Hawkins Day to announce market-moving information.During Greenspan’s 18 years at the Fed, market volatility was about twice as great on Humphrey-Hawkins Day than it was on other days. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note moved an average of 8.3 basis points every time he testified, compared with an average daily move of 4.5 basis points during his tenure.In his six H-H testimonies from July 1995 to July 1999, Greenspan moved the 10-year yield by at least 10 basis points every time he testified. On Feb. 20, 1996, for example, it jumped 25 basis points, as much as it would have if the Fed had surprised the market with a rate hike.By contrast, Ben Bernanke’s Humphrey-Hawkins appearances hardly moved the market at all, with the 10-year yield rising or falling an average of 3.4 basis points. Bernanke moved the 10-year by 10 basis points only once: on July 21, 2009.The only time Yellen has testified, on Feb. 11, the 10-year rose by 5 basis points.A twice-a-year trip to the Hill just doesn’t pack the punch it once did. The Fed has found more efficient ways to communicate with the markets. And that’s why Yellen isn’t likely to make news, or move the markets, today.Also read these stories:2 reasons the Fed may keep interest rates at zeroThe more the Fed explains, the less markets understand	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B39F9DC2-0B7E-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Mercedes goes from Africa to the U.K. on one tank	By Jay RameyBut upon arriving in the U.K. after 27 hours on the road, the team decided to continue on to the Goodwood Festival of Speed since they still had some fuel left.Not only did the duo make it Goodwood in West Sussex, but the E300 BlueTec Hybrid still showed a remaining range of about 100 miles.The car selected for the drive, a 2014 E300 BlueTec hybrid, features a 2.1-liter, 204-hp diesel engine and a 27-hp electric motor that generates 184 lb-ft of torque, all mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission.The overall torque generated by the two power plants is 368 lb-ft. That’s enough to give it the ability to make the sprint to 62 mph in 7.5 seconds, though the crucial figure on this drive was the 61.2 mpg the car was able to achieve. This E300 was also equipped with a larger 21-gallon fuel tank, a popular $170 option on this model.The route chosen wasn’t necessarily aimed at hypermiling. After all, there aren’t that many options when traveling from North Africa up to the U.K.The team encountered traffic jams, heavy rain, and very intense heat throughout the 27-hour journey, in addition to dramatic changes in elevation. The E300 BlueTec Hybrid covered two continents and four countries, driving through three time zones, with the final distance clocking in at 1,223 miles — approximately the distance from New York City to Kansas City.Before you head to your local Mercedes dealer, remember the E300 BlueTec Hybrid is not currently available in the U.S. We do get the E250 BlueTec however, and it features the same 2.1-liter twin-turbo diesel inline-four, good for 195 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. That car is officially capable of 28 mpg in the city and 42 mpg on the highway.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A601D416-0203-11E4-AA46-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
Marijuana is a booming boomer business	The buttoned-up crew was there for two days of networking and learning, a scene that would be mundane if not for the industry the conference was promoting, a product that’s illegal for most Americans and citizens of the world. “I used to be the oldest person in the room at these events,” Goodman told the audience for his panel about marijuana legalization and regulation at the Cannabis Business Summit. “I’m not anymore. That’s quite a shift.”No bongs or buds hereThe crowd, just shy of 1,000 people, was a far cry from the unrulier bunch that gathers for KushCon and Cannabis Cup. Not a bong or a bud could be found on the expo floor.In a sign of the nascent industry’s rapid maturing, this full-on National Cannabis Industry convention with educational breakout sessions and vendors hawking everything from water systems to consulting and lab-testing services was the place for entrepreneurs, investors, growers and retailers who hope to snatch their share of a $1.43 billion industry that’s projected to grow to more than $10 billion by 2018.  Though the federal government still classifies cannabis as a Schedule 1 substance, marijuana has become a legitimate — if not completely legal — industry. Colorado and Washington, which Hillary Clinton called “laboratories of democracy,” legalized full adult use last year, and 23 states have legalized medical use.Physicians in medical marijuana states are prescribing cannabis for conditions such as ADHA, cancer, glaucoma, Crohn’s disease and chronic pain. This spring, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an amendment prohibiting the Justice Department from interfering with medical marijuana laws, which is now pending approval in the Senate.Cannabis industry has sproutedOnce ruled by outlaws, the cannabis industry has matured in every way. No longer a bastion for longhairs and rebels, it’s now firmly under the control of the generation that has grown out of being longhairs and rebels — but still has it in them. Boomers with cash to spend are circling and closing in on the cannabis business because they see money to be made and they still love a good cause.Speakers and attendees at the Cannabis Business Summit were well aware of marijuana’s potential to make money. Suits don’t come to conferences for fun. Still, no one Next Avenue interviewed cited money as his or her primary reason for getting into the cannabis business. Instead, they said they were there out of humanitarian concerns, such as helping treat cancer.Marijuana is tangled up in social justice issues — more than one speaker pointed out the irony of gathering for a conference about making money on a plant that landed less fortunate people in jail — and is gaining traction as legitimate medicine with the likes of Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Dr. Mehmet Oz singing its praises.‘Where commerce meets a revolution’The tagline for this conference was “Where Commerce Meets a Revolution,” a sexy idea for boomers. Freedom and justice were the speakers’ buzzwords, and several presenters made nods to the generation that launched today’s cannabis revolution in the ’60s.“Hippies keep being right,” said Troy Dayton, CEO of Arcview Group, a marijuana investor network, market research and insurance firm, in his opening remarks, as many in the audience nodded in agreement. “They were right about renewable energy. They were right about organic food. And they’re right about cannabis.”Dayton said most investors in his network are boomers who’ve raised their kids, made some money and want to put some of their portfolio into something they believe will make a difference in the world.A solid example would be his father, 62-year-old Gary Dayton, who’s along for the ride as his son capitalizes on the cannabis revolution. Manning the booth while Troy moderated panels and schmoozed, Gary looked out at the crowd and commented, “This is not a bunch of potheads. These are people who are interested in freedom and making money.”‘The time is now’For many at the conference, the cannabis industry presents new opportunity to parlay well-honed skills. Carole Richter, of CRichter-HR Consulting, courted medical dispensary and retail pot shop owners while playing up her 25 years of experience in business, operations and human resources management.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=433E11FA-06EF-11E4-AC9A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

At 1.9%, inflation is now inching close to the Bank of England’s 2% target.“The news will further fuel expectations that the Bank of England will start rising interest rates sooner rather than later, with November looking the most likely month for the first hike,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, in a note.BOE Governor Mark Carney also addressed the speculation on interest rates at his testimony to the Treasury Select Committee, saying he doesn’t know when the first increase will come, but that it will be data dependent.In the U.S., Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will kick off two days of testimony to Congress later Tuesday.

U.S. stocks: Futures await Yellen, Goldman, retail sales	By Barbara Kollmeyer, MarketWatchThe data front is also busy enough, with testimony from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen as well as retail sales and producer prices on the calendar.Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average  /quotes/zigman/21524673/delayed DJU4 +0.08%  fell 8 points to 16,970, while those for the S&P 500 index /quotes/zigman/11777331/delayed SPU4 -0.16%  slipped 2.3 points to 1,968.70.

Economists polled by MarketWatch expected sales to rise 0.6% in June, after a modest 0.3% rise in May. The report is due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.There’s little evidence so far that consumers are ready to sustain a faster pace of spending. Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, said growth in retail sales will be “instrumental if the Fed intends to maintain its hawkish stance.”Import prices will be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, as will the Empire State index for July, which gauges the health of manufacturers in the New York region.Fed Chairwoman Yellen will give testimony to Congress on economy and monetary policy, on Tuesday and Wednesday. Investors will watch her comments closely for clues as to how she will manage monetary policy in the coming months.

Is Yahoo’s Mayer still ‘amazing’ or simply ‘failed’?	By Marek Fuchs, MarketWatchThat is why Yahoo’s /quotes/zigman/59898/delayed/quotes/nls/yhoo YHOO +0.76% second-quarter earnings report, expected after the close of trading today, a day short of the two-year anniversary of Marissa Mayer’s heralded appointment, is shaping up as the consummate pivot point.You can already see the media seizing the two-year anniversary as the appropriate moment to take the first cold, hard look at Mayer’s tenure, which has produced a lot of excitement, but only middling results.Asked National Public Radio about Mayer, recently mocked for snoozing through a meeting: “So two years in, how’s she doing?”That marker — two years — has all but become a prefix to Mayer’s name. In an earnings preview , Yahoo itself wrote: “It’s been two years since Marissa Mayer became CEO at Yahoo …”While Yahoo has been “a Wall Street darling,” Mayer has not made the company’s products “more popular.” This sudden turn toward revisionism is also apparent in a Fortune lead: “At first blush, Marissa Mayer’s nearly two-year tenure at Yahoo seems golden. …” But after two years, there is always a second blush .Noting the two-year anniversary of her appointment, The Wall Street Journal did not even blush, writing: “The clock is now ticking for Marissa Mayer.”This is quite a change from the celebratory narrative we saw from the time of Mayer’s appointment until the two-year anniversary was in sight — and will probably influence traders. They have been kind to Yahoo’s stock in Mayer’s tenure — no surprise, until fairly recently. The recent lurch in the Mayer story line, though, will push them to cast an especially critical eye at today’s earnings.How far Mayer has suddenly fallen in the court of public opinion. Mayer was originally the source of genuflecting as someone who “blazed trails” as both a woman engineer and ”serious technologist who was also willing to show her feminine side.” As a pregnant CEO , she was a corporate leader and cultural touchstone, all rolled up into one woman from Wausau, Wisc.Much of the original level of praise was deserved, but then the media’s hyperbole machine kicked in. Vogue ran a story called “ Hail to the Chief ” with a sultry photo spread.Back then, Fortune, recently seen blushing, used the words “unprecedented” and “amazing” to capture Mayer in a headline and soon declared Mayer “the first CEO in a parade of bosses to produce a turnaround strategy that appears to be working.” This, mind you, was just over a year after her appointment. Never mind Rome not being built in a day, it took well over a year for Steve Jobs, technology genius without parallel, to turn around Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +1.29% .But such is life in the fast lane of shifting story lines. The media tells one story with total assuredness, then tells the complete opposite with the same degree of assuredness.Overreaction is their default mode. To avoid falling for the next leg of it, here’s what we know for certain:Mayer had a grace period to make acquisitions — including the $1.1 billion Tumblr deal — and to hire big-name media creatures like Katie Couric and David Pogue. Now, though, at the two-year mark, the media and traders will legitimately want something more than middling results to show for it.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E30018E0-0B78-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
In Bizarro Market, stocks rise along with pessimism	By Nat WordenIt was the 1990s. Jobs were plentiful with the unemployment rate at 5.4%. Air travel was dirt cheap and easy, and every Sept. 11 was just another day in a country brimming with peace, prosperity and confidence in the future.Nowadays, economic hardship is everywhere, and the future seems bleak. The nation is bogged down with intractable foreign military misadventures and under constant threat from a new enemy — “the terrorists.” Class divisions are bitter as social safety nets have grown, taxes have increased on high earners and the federal bailout of the titans of Wall Street remains a bitter pill to swallow for working families now trying to make ends meet.Instead of feeling irrationally exuberant, most people seem to be rationally pessimistic about their investments, and yet the Dow is somehow gyrating around 17,000, a record. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 23% over the past 12 months, with trendy stocks like Facebook /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB +2.35%  and Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +1.29%  hovering near all-time highs.Welcome to the Bizarro Market. This stock market reminds me of the great Seinfeld episode called “The Bizarro Jerry” when Jerry describes to Elaine the concept of the “Bizarro World,” an old Superman comic-book reference. The Bizarro World is the mirror opposite of the real world. “Up is down; down is up,” says Jerry. “[Superman] says ‘hello’ when he leaves, ‘goodbye’ when he arrives.”In the Bizarro Market, investors are actually leaving the stock market, even as stock prices keep recording new highs.In Bizarro Market, the post-financial-crisis economic recovery is so fragile after half a decade that the Fed is keeping its short-term interest rate target at a record low of near-zero to keep things afloat, even while the stock market roars like it’s 1999.And in Bizarro Market, the bubble has few cheerleaders. Whatever bullish commentators exist are being drowned out by a constant barrage of media commentating and reportage making the case that stocks are way overvalued.The notion that the stock market is largely disconnected from the real economy is almost ubiquitous — self-evident even to people who know next to nothing about investing. And it’s hardly contrarian to be out making the case that stocks are in a bubble. A real contrarian in today’s environment would be arguing that the stock market is undervalued and has plenty of room to run. Even stock brokers and financial advisers desperate to lure new clients into stocks can only bring themselves to say that equities are probably fairly valued at best.And, still, the bull market charges on without even your token 10% correction.It’s hard out there in Bizarro Market for your professional investment managers. Those who ignored all the hysterics in 2009, 2010 and 2011 and guided clients into the stock market deserve credit for capturing the spectacular gains of recent years, but now what?Nobel Laureate and Yale Professor Robert Shiller, author of “Irrational Exuberance,” reports that his price-to-earnings ratio metric puts stock valuations at historic highs, comparable with levels that were reached before the stock market crash of 1929 and the financial crisis of 2008.Stocks appear overvalued, and the Fed is about to rein in its easy-money policies. Such a move would not bode well for stocks if and when it happens, but remember, the Dow kept climbing for over four years after “The Bizarro Jerry” aired on NBC in 1996 and Greenspan famously uttered the words “irrational exuberance.” It peaked in early 2000 at nearly 12,000.So when will Bizarro Market peak? That is, of course, the trillion-dollar question, and I’m not a market-timer, so I wouldn’t venture a guess. The economy certainly has room to improve, and the average small-time investor could get a lot more optimistic, which may mean this could go on for quite a while.However, the key to investing success is to buy low and sell high, and right now, prices look high.More from MarketWatch:22 stocks that may be the gems of earnings seasonAvoid a U.S. stock market meltdown and go globalAre crash conditions growing or fading?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=38FAA7CC-0B99-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
What to know about BlackRock’s earnings, Vanguard’s gains with ETFs	By Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatchForecasts: At about 6:30 a.m. Eastern Wednesday, the world’s largest asset manager is expected to report earnings of $4.46 per share for the second quarter, up from $4.15 a year ago, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. BlackRock’s quarterly revenue is seen rising to $2.72 billion, up from $2.48 billion a year ago.Market share in ETFs keeps slipping: The gains by ETF providers through June 30 are already known, with BlackRock’s /quotes/zigman/249424/delayed/quotes/nls/blk BLK +1.71% iShares business achieving about $1 trillion in ETF assets worldwide and still leading in market share at 38%. That’s according to BlackRock’s monthly “ETP Landscape” report.Rival Vanguard Group has continued to increase its market share in the year to date, scoring $393.8 billion in ETF assets for 15% of the market. State Street Corp. /quotes/zigman/179646/delayed/quotes/nls/stt STT +1.43%  , which rounds out the Big Three providers in the ETF industry, had $427.6 billion in assets as of June 30 and its market share has dipped to 16.2%. ETFs are lower-cost, increasingly popular funds that generally track indexes and trade on exchanges like stocks.Don’t give Vanguard too much credit for winning market share in the ETF industry, argues Jim Shanahan, an analyst with Edward Jones. He said there are cases when money going into a Vanguard ETF comes from an existing Vanguard customer who otherwise would have opted for the company’s index mutual funds. “It’s not as though they’ve gained a new customer,” Shanahan told MarketWatch.Active equity improves, but still seen as drag: In the wake of BlackRock’s first-quarter earnings report on April 17, some analysts fretted about a net outflow of $6.9 billion in the company’s active equity business .Outflows likely will continue through the end of this year for that business, even though BlackRock has changed personnel and performance has improved in an “impressive’ way, Shanahan said. Key funds have gotten much better, but they’re still short of the three-year record that is almost essential if a manager’s ability to deliver sustained performance is an issue, wrote Fortune’s Carol Loomis in her lengthy profile of BlackRock and its CEO Larry Fink .What about fixed income? Fink might again highlight BlackRock’s unconstrained bond funds, a growth area, as well as face questions about whether he’s taken business from his longtime friend, Pimco’s Bill Gross.To buy or not to buy? Shanahan of Edward Jones has a hold rating on BlackRock, citing worries about the growth in lower-margin products rather than higher-margin offerings. He also pointed out it’s hard for BlackRock, with $4.3 trillion in assets under management, to achieve its target of 5% growth.“That’s like bolting on two Artisan Partners every year or bolting on a Janus every year,” he said, referring to other asset managers.Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Bedell has a buy rating on BlackRock, saying in a June note that “strengthening net inflows across iShares products can be a positive near-term catalyst.” But risks for the bull case include substantial market downturns, losing key personnel and more regulatory attention, Bedell wrote.More from MarketWatch:Goldman: 22 stocks that may be the gems of earnings seasonWhy Citi’s $7 billion mortgage settlement may help borrowersJim Paulsen: A correction for stocks is coming, then more years of gains	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=FFCAFB90-0B71-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Why are consumers holding back?	By Irwin Kellner, MarketWatchThis has confounded the pundits who were hoping for a quick bounce back. After all, they reasoned, unemployment is down, jobs and incomes are up — and the weather is more seasonal.But retail sales in the first two months of the second quarter were soft. Adjusting for inflation there was no growth. And this follows a first quarter that was equally as bad.Sluggish spending by consumers was the chief reason why U.S. gross domestic product fell in the first quarter, according to preliminary estimates. But this came at a time when hiring was rigorous, sending the jobless rate down to lows not seen since 2008.As The Wall Street Journal put it last week, many store chains are in a “retail funk.” So what’s going on? To get the answer, we need to drill down beneath these top-line stats.First of all, incomes may be up, but not everyone is enjoying these gains. The top 10% are doing fine, thanks to their holdings of stocks and real estate. The middle class is not doing as well. Unfortunately, these are the customers that most retailers depend on.People are in a dour mood, and with good reason: 60% of households think that they are not likely to achieve the American dream. More than half can’t afford the house they live in.Even the job numbers are skewed. Notwithstanding the increases referred to above, 1 out of 6 working-age men has no job, while labor force participation is down by 8 million. At the same time, many Americans have simply given up looking for work.As for job creation, it is well known that small and mid-size businesses are the engine of job growth, and this time is no exception. However these gains are increasingly being offset by cutbacks by large firms that are outsourcing and using technology to replace employees.In other words, there are not enough small companies out there to offset cuts being implemented by large firms.To make matters worse, most consumers are finding that their paychecks don’t go as far as they used to, thanks to soaring prices of food, energy, health care and college tuition. As a consequence, many have become extremely careful shoppers: They buy only what they have to from the least-expensive outlet.To augment these efforts, people are increasingly turning to the Internet. This is the last thing retailers need.The outlook for consumer spending is more of the same. Other sectors of the economy are maxed out, monetary policy has gone about as far as it can go, and fiscal policy is frozen until the elections.Talk about a funk!In Bizzaro Market, stocks rise along with pessimism5 reasons not to retire abroadEven by his own standards, CNBC personality Rick Santelli has a bit of a meltdown	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5D308596-0BE2-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

U.S. import price index rises slightly in June	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The prices paid for goods imported into the U.S. edged up 0.1% in June, largely because of higher fuel costs, the U.S. Labor Department said Tuesday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 0.4% increase Excluding fuel, import prices fell by 0.1% last month. The prices of U.S.-made goods exported to other nations, meanwhile, dropped 0.4% in June. In May, the increase in import prices was revised up to show a 0.3% increase instead of 0.1%. Over the past year import prices have climbed at a 1.2% rate, the biggest year-over-year gain since March 2012. Yet the index is unchanged in the past 12 months excluding fuel costs.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0BA0285C-D5F8-46E3-BAE5-7DCB6E6A8B6B&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
Retail sales climb less than expected 0.2% in June	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Sales at U.S. retailers rose in June by the smallest amount since January, but most stores except for auto dealers and home-improvement outlets boasted an improvement in revenue. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% last month, or by 0.4% excluding the auto sector, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Retail sales account for about one-third of consumer spending, the main engine of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast retail sales to rise by 0.6% overall and by 0.6% minus autos. While auto dealers are selling the highest number of vehicles in eight years, they are also offering widespread discounts and that appeared to result in lower revenue in June. Auto sales dropped 0.3%, the first decline in five months. Yet sales rose for stores that sell clothes, food, electronics, health items, sporting goods and books. Sales also increased at bars and restaurants, general-stores, department stores and Internet retailers. Whats more, sales were revised higher for May and April, the first two months of the second quarter. In May, sales were revised to a show a 0.5% increase instead of 0.3%. And April sales were revised up to 0.6% from 0.5%. In the past year, retail sales have risen 4.3%, about two-thirds as fast as normally is the case.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E2F37EC0-C362-4A78-A1B1-16854BEA7DD8&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
Empire State index reaches four-year high of 25.6	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The Empire State manufacturing survey climbed to 25.6 in July, up from 19.3 in June, to reach a four-year high, the New York Fed said Tuesday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a 17.3 reading, in the gauge where readings above zero indicate improving conditions.

Stock market live blog: Dow hits intraday record, looks to the Fed; Goldman, J.P. Morgan up	We’re live blogging all the action in the stock market on Tuesday. For a concise rundown of the day’s trading activity, see Market Snapshot.MarketWatch’s Barbara Kollmeyer has the deets on the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch fund manager survey, which (surprise!) shows extreme bullishness on equities. She writes:Among those global asset allocators surveyed, a net 61% are now overweight equities. That difference between those who are overweight versus those that are underweight is the survey’s highest reading since early 2011, and the second-strongest response ever for the bank’s monthly report that takes the pulse of fund managers.So we’re been here’s some bullish articulations in recent days (See: S&P 500 has more steam left than we thought, Goldman says). But what do you think?Speaking of Yellen, here’s what could get traders yelling this a.m., courtesy of Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets:“The main event comes later this morning with FOMC Chair Yellen delivering her twice yearly testimony to Congress. While she has generally been dovish to date, any change from that could bring a strong response from the street.  At its last meeting the Fed moved up its timetable for the end of tapering to October from the December the street had expected. Since then, US job growth has continued to accelerate and an increasing number of FOMC members have been calling for earlier action on interest rates. “The Dow hit an intraday record after a trio of data before the opening bell that traders largely took as positive:With Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen appearing before Congress at 10 a.m. Eastern, here’s how the data set her up, according to Eric Green, head of U.S. rates and economic research at TD Securities:“None of this data is a game changer, it merely reinforces what looks to be an economy gaining more traction. Yellen will focus more on how conditions are expected to evolve later in the year and beyond and these numbers neither rule out a turn lower in demand or a turn higher.”plugYour browser does not support iframes.Other big movers: GoPro Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/34007695/delayed /quotes/nls/gpro GPRO is up over 9% after an analyst initiated the wearable camera maker at a buy rating.Plug Power Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/5142101/delayed /quotes/nls/plug PLUG also got a buy rating initiation, sending the stock up 10%.Lorillard Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/511272/delayed /quotes/nls/lo LO will get bought out by Reynolds American Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/334469/delayed /quotes/nls/rai RAI .

The Fed appears more sanguine on the market more broadly. Valuation measures for the overall market in early July were generally at levels not far above their historical averages, suggesting that, in aggregate, investors are not excessively optimistic regarding equities.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=DA69B15B-6070-45F2-A09C-4379B7E702F1&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

The best way to loan your child money to buy a home	By Bill BischoffBut buying without some family assistance might be tough. Mortgage lenders may still demand substantial down payments, charge high fees, and offer unattractive interest rates to those with less-than-stellar credit. The solution? For parents and grandparents to step up and loan the adult child enough money to make the purchase. Obviously, this idea isn’t for everyone, but if you can afford to consider it, here’s what you need to know to avoid unwanted tax complications.How to give the kid a dealThe current low-interest-rate environment makes the idea of loaning money to your child (or grandchild) to help with a first-time home purchase look really good from the borrower’s perspective. But time may be of the essence here, because there’s no guarantee that interest rates will stay this low for too much longer.Here’s the scoop on charging an interest rate that’s low enough to give your child (or grandchild) a smoking good deal, but not so low that it results in tax complications for you. The key is knowing the IRS-approved applicable federal rate (AFR). The AFR is the lowest interest rate you can charge on a loan to a family member without running afoul of the dreaded below-market loan rules. I won’t go into all the gory details about how these rules work, but they involve tricky calculations and having to pay federal income tax on phantom interest income that you never actually receive. So these rules are something to avoid when possible.For a term loan (one with specified installment repayment dates or a balloon repayment date), the relevant AFR is the one for a loan of that duration for the month the loan is made. Right now, AFRs are still super-low by historical standards, so making a loan that charges the AFR is a great way to give your child (or grandchild) a very favorable interest rate deal without causing tax worries for yourself.For example, say you make a $150,000 term loan this month (July 2014) to help your daughter buy her first home. You wisely follow my advice and charge an annual interest rate equal to the current AFR. For a loan with a term of 3 years or less, the AFR is a microscopic 0.31%. The AFR for a loan with a term of more than 3 years but not over 9 years is only 1.80%. The AFR for a loan with a term of more than 9 years is only 3.02%. These rates assume monthly compounding of interest, and they are all pretty sweet from a borrower’s perspective.You can then continue to charge an interest rate equal to the AFR (whichever one applies to your loan) over the entire loan term, regardless of how interest rates fluctuate during that time. For example, if you make a 20-year loan to your daughter this month, you can charge the low 3.02% rate for the entire 20 years even if interest rates skyrocket in the future.Note: AFRs can change every month, and they will go up if general interest rates go up. You can find the AFRs for the month you make a loan at the IRS website . Use the search feature, and enter: applicable federal rates 2014.The bottom lineAs long you make the loan while AFRs are still low and charge an interest rate equal to the AFR, your child or grandchild will get a good deal, and you won’t have any tax issues beyond having to report the interest income on your Form 1040. But don’t wait too long. The current super-low AFRs probably have a limited shelf life.One more thing: be sure to put the loan in writing, and take the extra step of securing the loan with the property your child or grandchild buys. That way, your child or grandchild can deduct the interest under the home mortgage interest rules, and you are assured of getting repaid when the property is sold. You can find suitable canned loan documents on the Internet for free or for a low price.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=584D7ACA-0B83-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
Oil slides below $100 a barrel; Brent at 3-month low	By William L. Watts, MarketWatchOn the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for delivery in August /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -1.27%  were down 89 cents, or 0.9%, at $100.02 a barrel after trading as low as $99.91. August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -1.69%  on London’s ICE futures exchange dropped $1.34, or 1.3%, to $105.64 a barrel.“Easing fears of an Iraqi supply disruption and tepid fuel demand levels continue to erase the geopolitical risk premium (Iraq and the Ukraine) that boosted both [WTI and Brent] markets to nine-month highs late last month,” said Eugene McGillan, strategist at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., in a note.Analysts at JBC Energy noted that all three major oil-forecasting agencies — the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration — have cut their forecasts for growth in oil demand this year.Meanwhile, the United Nations said it was withdrawing staff from Libya temporarily after rival militias fought over Tripoli’s airport. Expectations for a rebound in long-depressed Libyan oil production helped push oil futures lower last week.Meanwhile, U.S. June retail sales rose at the slowest pace since January, increasing by a seasonally adjusted 0.2%. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.4%. Economists had expected sales to rise by 0.6% on both measures.The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly report on U.S. crude oil inventories Tuesday afternoon, while the Energy Information Administration’s more influential report will be released Wednesday morning.Analysts surveyed by energy information firm Platts project a 3 million barrel drop in U.S. commercial crude-oil stocks in the week ended July 11.In product markets, Nymex reformulated gasoline blendstock for August /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 -1.05%  -- the benchmark gasoline contract -- fell 2.25 cents, or 0.8%, to $2.9026 a gallon while August heating oil traded /quotes/zigman/9821456/delayed HOU4 -0.98%  at $2.8477-- down 2.5 cents.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Why gold just posted its biggest drop this yearSix countries that make up half the world’s populationHere’s what Sen.

Retail sales rise at slowest pace in five months	By Jeffry Bartash, MarketWatchSales were also a bit stronger than previously reported in May and April, according to revised government data. That could give an extra pop to the estimate for U.S. growth in the second quarter when the government reports the preliminary figure at the end of the month.Retail sales account for about one-third of consumer spending, the main engine of economic activity, and the report helps determine gross domestic product. Economists polled by MarketWatch project a 3.2% gain in second-quarter GDP.In the past year, retail sales have risen 4.3%, about two-thirds as fast as normally is the case. That’s enough to keep the economy growing at a modest rate but not so fast to kick growth into a higher gear.Americans are feeling more confident about the economy amid one of the best spurts of job creation in years, but they are not willing yet to significantly increase spending or reduce their rate of savings. Slow wage growth is one reason they continue to hold back.“Ultimately, the economy will need to see a pickup in consumer activity moving forward if growth is to accelerate meaningfully during the latter half of the year,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.In June, retail sales rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2%, or by 0.4% excluding the auto sector, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.The increase fell short of Wall Street’s forecast. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast sales to rise by 0.6% overall and by 0.6% minus autos.Yet the weakness in sales was largely confined to auto dealers and home-improvement stores such as Lowe’s or Home Depot. Most other retailers saw a pickup in sales.While auto dealers are selling the highest number of vehicles in eight years, they are also offering sharp discounts and that resulted in lower revenue in June. Auto sales dropped 0.3%, the first decline in five months.Sales also sank 1% at home-improvement outlets, the biggest decline since October.On the upside, sales rose for stores that sell clothes, food, electronics, health items, sporting goods and books. Sales also increased at bars and restaurants, general stores, department stores and Internet retailers.What’s more, sales in May were revised to show a 0.5% increase instead of 0.3%. And April sales were revised up to 0.6% from 0.5%.Home-price expectations highest in the WestEmpire State index reaches four-year high in July	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9B743112-0C15-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Goldman Sachs profit, revenue rise to top estimates	By Saabira ChaudhuriResults easily topped the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, pushing shares up 1.9% in recent premarket trading.Goldman /quotes/zigman/188479/delayed/quotes/nls/gs GS +0.99%  posted net income of $2.04 billion, compared with year-earlier net income of $1.93 billion. Earnings per share--reflecting the payment of preferred dividends--were $4.10, while net revenue rose 6% to $9.13 billion. Analysts expected per-share earnings of $3.05 on revenue of $7.97 billion.Goldman reported a 10% drop in fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading revenue, to $2.22 billion. The bank’s report comes after Citigroup Inc. on Monday reported its own FICC revenue had dropped 12% in the second quarter, and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. earlier Tuesday said its FICC revenue was down 15%.Goldman’s FICC business, a crucial profit engine for more than a decade, had faced headwinds similar to those buffeting rivals. In late May, the firm’s president, Gary Cohn, acknowledged the challenging conditions in an investor presentation. But in June, some debt markets began to show signs of life, giving some analysts and investors hope that strong finish would help rescue Goldman and its peers from disappointing trading quarter.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch :In bizarro market, stocks rise along with pessimismYellen’s still on honeymoon, YOLO bull party5 reasons not to spend your retirement abroad	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CBF2480A-0C16-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
Lloyds nears Libor settlement with U.S., U.K.	By David EnrichSettlement talks have accelerated recently, and regulators are hoping to announce a deal in the next few weeks, these people said.Lloyds, which is about 25%-owned by the British government after a taxpayer bailout, would become the seventh financial institution to resolve U.S. and British investigations into attempted rigging of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and other widely used benchmark rates.Negotiations between Lloyds /quotes/zigman/126322/delayed UK:LLOY -0.34%   and the regulators are still in progress, these people said. The size of the financial penalty that Lloyds is likely to pay to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority and possibly other authorities isn’t clear.Penalties assessed during the yearslong Libor probe have ranged from $2.2 million paid by small London brokerage firm R.P.

Reynolds American to buy Lorillard for $25 billion	By Michael CaliaThe deal combines Reynolds’ /quotes/zigman/334469/delayed/quotes/nls/rai RAI -3.67%  Camel and Pall Mall cigarettes with Lorillard’s /quotes/zigman/511272/delayed/quotes/nls/lo LO -7.48%  popular Newport menthol brand to create a more powerful No. 2 to U.S. industry leader Altria Inc. /quotes/zigman/294903/delayed/quotes/nls/mo MO -1.76%  , maker of Marlboro. Reynolds expects to have more than $11 billion in revenue and about $5 billion in operating income after the deal.Additionally, Reynolds American said it reached a deal to sell the Kool, Salem, Winston, Maverick and Blu eCigs brands and other assets to Imperial Tobacco Group PLC /quotes/zigman/167179/delayed UK:IMT -2.41%  for $7.1 billion in cash. Reynolds said it expects to receive $4.4 billion in proceeds after taxes. Selling the brands is aimed at easing the antitrust scrutiny that the deal may face.The potential combination comes as tobacco majors try to increase scale and cut costs amid a yearslong decline in U.S. cigarette consumption, including an estimated 4% contraction last year, even as profits remain robust. Two rare pockets of growth in the $100 billion U.S. tobacco market are e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes. Lorillard is the market leader in both.Under the terms, Lorillard shareholders will receive $50.50 in cash and 0.29 Reynolds shares in exchange for each Lorillard share, a value of $68.88 per share. Including the assumption of debt, the deal is valued at $27.4 billion, the companies said.The potential tie-up faces significant risks, including tough antitrust scrutiny. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is also weighing a possible crackdown on menthol cigarettes, which fuel more than 80% of Lorillard’s sales, after the agency banned all other cigarette flavors in 2009.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:In Bizarro Market, stocks rise along with pessimism5 reasons not to spend your retirement abroadThe best way to loan your child money to buy a home	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=4EAEB7F2-0C20-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
Treasurys fall after stronger economic data	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe benchmark 10-year note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +0.12%  yield, which rises as prices fall, was up half a basis point at 2.554%, on track for its second consecutive day of losses. Treasury prices initially bounced around on the data before pushing lower.Sales by U.S. retailers in June rose by the smallest amount since January. The 0.2% gains, or 0.4% excluding autos, compared with economist forecasts of a 0.6% rise in both measures. Nonetheless, the underlying numbers showed a firming in the data alongside upward revisions, according to David Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLCThe Empire State manufacturing survey rose to a four-year high of 25.6 in July from 19.3 in June. The U.S. import price index edged up in June.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR +0.18%  yield rose a basis point to 3.381% and the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR +0.06%  yield rose slightly to 1.676%.Now, investors turn to remarks from Yellen, who is scheduled for two days of testimony before Congress. She begins at 10 a.m. Eastern on Tuesday in front of the Senate Banking Committee. Investors are looking for signals that the central bank recognizes economic data are improving, and may prompt them to raise key interest rates sooner than initially thought. Yellen has remained committed to its zero-rate policy until the labor market rebounds and inflation stabilizes.Nonetheless, traders have subdued expectations for when and how the Fed hikes rates, especially given uncertainty about the rate-hike process. Market participants forecast the first rate hike to come in July 2015, according to CME FedWatch, which makes calculations based on fed funds futures contracts.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Nutting: The Fed used to rock the markets at this time of yearWorden: In Bizarro Market, stocks rise along with pessimismStates that workers want to escape from the most	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=484EA088-0C1C-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Should you buy a Faberge egg on eBay?	By Quentin Fottrell, MarketWatchOn Monday, Sotheby’s and eBay said art and collectibles from the luxury auction house will be made available to eBay’s 145 million active buyers (although many may not be able to afford Sotheby’s prices). Both companies say they’ll focus on items at price points where their respective customers converge such as jewelry, watches, prints, wine, photographs and 20th Century design. “We believe there is a great opportunity, through this partnership, to truly make art more accessible to exponentially more collectors,” Bruno Vinciguerra, Sotheby’s chief operating officer, said in a statement.It’s a co-branding oddity, says Heidi Lee-Komaromi, an art adviser and founder of consultancy HLK Art Group and director of strategic partnerships at Artnet, an art market data firm. “This is a high-low relationship to say the least,” she says. But customers may feel reassured that Sotheby’s team of experts will have checked the provenance of the items for sale and, she says, “Sotheby’s should make sure that prices are kept in check.” Financially, the partnership makes sense, she says. “EBay has a very robust platform and can be used easily instead of investing millions of dollars to build their own from scratch,” Heidi Lee-Komaromi adds.Collectors are getting more daring about buying art online. “Buying art based on a digital image has become the norm rather than the exception,” a 2013 report by international specialist insurance company Hiscox concluded. The report was based on 101 international art buyers on ArtTactic, a London-based art market research and analysis firm, 130 established international art collectors and 58 international contemporary art galleries. Still, only one-quarter of those surveyed have spent over 50,000 pounds ($85,000) or more buying art online. Another 25% were willing to spend more than that on a single artwork.That said, the online art market is still minuscule when compared with the overall size of the industry. Global online art and antiques sales in 2013 were estimated “conservatively” at more than 2.5 billion euros ($3.4 billion), according to a recent report released by the European Fine Art Foundation in Maastricht, the Netherlands. That accounts for just 5% of the total art market, but the report estimates online sales could grow at a rate of at least 25% per annum. Total sales in the international art and antiques market hit 47.4 billion euros ($64.5 billion) last year, up 8% on the year before.Also see: How to avoid buying fake products onlineThere have been some big-ticket online art sales, however. Christie’s, which started allowing live online bids on auctions in 2006, sold a $9.6 million Edward Hopper painting, “October on Cape Cod,” to an online bidder in November 2012. In addition to streaming auctions, Christie’s launched an online-only sale channel in 2011 with its own fully-integrated platform. Last May, Christie’s also sold American sculptor and video artist Richard Serra’s “Pamuk” in an online-only sale for $905,000. To date, Christie’s has hosted 85 online-only sales, with clients from 185 different countries.Paddle8 , the online marketplace that hired Britain’s Princess Eugenie last year as benefit auctions manager, sold a giant egg by American artist Jeff Koons last April for $900,000 as part of the company’s “Faberge Big Egg Hunt,” its biggest single sale to date. Bidding activity on Paddle8 quadrupled between 2012 and 2013, and in the first quarter of 2014 and first half of the second quarter, posted $15 million in revenue. (It doesn’t disclose total annual revenue.) Artworks listed on Artsy , a marketplace connecting collectors and those that sell art, range up to $10 million per piece, a spokeswoman says.But these big ticket items are the exceptions. “Our sweet spot for artworks sold online is the $2,000 to $15,000 range,” says Paddle8 CEO Aditya Julka. “You can buy the same TV anywhere online, but our inventory is unique,” he says. Paddle8 authenticates artwork sold online, he adds, and sees itself as a complement — rather than a competitor — to Christie’s online auctions and the partnership between Sotheby’s and eBay, as Paddle8 occupies a more affordable end of the market. It charges commissions of 6% for sellers and 15% for buyers, less than the 20% or more charged by most brick-and-mortar auction houses.Collectors shouldn’t be too click-happy when it comes to buying a major piece of art online, especially from unfamiliar dealers. She recommends the “opposite of showrooming” — that is, viewing the art online before assessing it in person to make sure it isn’t a forgery. For checking the market value and provenance of a piece of art, consumers can check auction house records on sites such as ArtPrice and Artnet , although there is no legal guarantee. “The stakes get much higher for buying fine art above a certain level,” Lee-Komaromi says. “People are getting too comfortable with buying art online site unseen.”	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=5B010F2E-0B98-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Why mortgage rates haven’t risen as expected	By Amy Hoak, MarketWatchThere are a few reasons why higher rates never came to pass.Rates on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.15% for the week ending July 10, according to Freddie Mac’s weekly survey of conforming mortgage rates. A year ago, rates averaged 4.51%.“In January, we were projecting at the end of the year that the 30-year would be 5.1%,” said Leonard Kiefer, deputy chief economist with Freddie Mac. “We most recently revised that down to 4.4%.Economists had largely expected rates to rise once the Federal Reserve indicated it would taper its purchase of mortgage-backed securities through its quantitative easing program, Kiefer said. Rates did, in fact, rise spike upward due to that indication last summer.But when the Fed actually began purchasing fewer of these securities, mortgage rates began to fall. That’s because the tapering ended up coinciding with a reduction in mortgage originations — which means fewer mortgage-backed securities were being issued, Kiefer said.Also read: How to get thousands in mortgage relief from Citigroup“The Fed’s ‘demand’ for new mortgage-backed securities has declined less than has the new ‘supply,’” Kiefer and chief economist Frank Nothaft wrote in a recent outlook.And that’s keeping rates down.Fewer mortgages are being originated in large part because refinance activity is down; with rates no longer at record lows, there are fewer homeowners interested in refinancing these days. Also, while the housing market is improving, there hasn’t been an abundance of first-time home buyers in the market today, and that has been a drag on housing, said Ted Ahern, chief financial officer of mortgage lender Guaranteed Rate.“There’s not a big supply of mortgages being originated, so that in and of itself kind of keeps the rates down,” Ahern said.Another reason for the supply/demand imbalance: Global investors buying mortgage-backed securities, said Dan Green, chief publishing officer of The Mortgage Reports, a mortgage blog.“Wall Street planned for the end of QE3 in a vacuum. There was no consideration given to the health of domestic and global economies or to market-destabilizing geopolitics,” Green wrote in an email interview. “The Fed has been exiting the market exactly as forecast, but not as quickly as global investors have joined. Demand for mortgage-backed securities still outweighs supply, which has lowered consumer mortgage rates.”Low inflation, a weaker-than-expected economy in the first quarter and a “decent, but not great” housing market are also forces contributing to keeping mortgage rates low, Ahern said.Eventually mortgage rates will go higher — unless there’s some sort of slowdown in economic growth, a recession or some big shock to the economy, Kiefer said. “It’s likely to be gradual, but [rates are going] up, for sure,” he added.Once it’s clear the economy is expanding, mortgage rates should be on their way up, Green said.In fact, those in the market for a mortgage may want to pay close attention to any marked improvement in the job numbers and any increases in inflation, Ahern said. Those are likely to be tell-tale signs that rates are heading up, he said.Also on MarketWatch:To win a house bidding war, get creativeHeres what well give up for a down payment on a homeApartment rent hikes are slowing—finally	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=3ED46142-0C2F-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Yahoo earnings: Focus on Alibaba, display business	By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatchEarnings: The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Web portal is expected to report a profit of 38 cents a share, according to FactSet, compared with a net income of 35 cents a share in the year-earlier period.Revenue: Yahoo /quotes/zigman/59898/delayed/quotes/nls/yhoo YHOO -1.03%  is seen reporting revenue of $1.08 billion, according to FactSet, up slightly from sales of $1.07 billion the same period last year.Stock react: Yahoo shares jumped in April after the company reported an improvement in its core business and better-than-expected results from Alibaba, the Chinese Internet giant in which the company owns a 24% stake. Alibaba is expected to go public later this year.Meanwhile, the shares have lagged the broader market this year amid concerns over the company’s core display business. The stock was down 0.9% at $35.39 in early trading on Tuesday, and has lost 12% in 2014, versus a 6.7% year-to-date gain in the S&P 500.Key areas to watch: With Alibaba set to go public in the coming months, investors will be mainly focused on comments from Yahoo management on what it plans to do with the expected cash haul from the Chinese Internet giant’s offering.Any signal that Yahoo plans to return a big chunk of that cash to shareholders would be greeted favorably by Wall Street, analysts say. On the other hand, Yahoo management, led by Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, could also point to more acquisitions as the company pushes forward with an ambitious turnaround strategy.Then again, Yahoo could simply stay silent on its Alibaba plan, says B. Riley analyst Sameet Sinha.“With the IPO imminent, the question will be about use of the proceeds,” Sinha told clients in a Monday note. “We do not think Yahoo management will lay out a plan as yet for the proceeds which could disappoint investors.”On the other hand, Yahoo could get its investors excited by pointing to continued improvement in its core business, particularly in display ads.

Stock market live blog: S&P 500 erases gain as Yellen speaks; biotech, social media hit	We’re live blogging all the action in the stock market on Tuesday. For a concise rundown of the day’s trading activity, see Market Snapshot.Drew Wilson, investment analyst at Fenimore Asset Management:“Investors are particularly interested to see proof that earnings did bounce back in the second quarter. If we do not see solid growth and positive outlooks for the rest of the year, we might see some repricing, as current multiples without growth are not sustainable”Yellen checks all the boxes, says Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group LLC: 1)Yellen is not concerned at all about inflation: Check2)Yellen still sees significant excess slack in the labor market: Check3)Yellen wants to keep the federal funds rate well below what was previously viewed as normal in the longer run: Check4)Yellen said the path of short rates will depend on the data: Check5)Yellen thinks QE will end in October: Check6)Yellen does not see valuations out of the ordinary for stocks, real estate and corporate bonds: Check7)Valuations remain stretched in junk and leveraged loan debt: Check8)Yellen is an uber dove: Check9)Yellen believes more in free money than free markets: CheckBottom line, today’s testimony from Yellen is basically a repeat of all her thoughts she has expressed over the past few months in a slew of speeches and a magazine article. My checklist was fully confirmed. The only thing that can extract some more details about the future direction of policy will be the upcoming data and her answers to the questions today from mostly uninformed Congress men and women.It seems like it’s going to be tough for small caps, biotechs, Internet names and social-media stocks to finish today with gains given that Fed commentary.MarketWatch’s Steve Goldstein has pointed out a key Fed quote: “Valuation metrics in some sectors do appear substantially stretched –particularly those for smaller firms in the social-media and biotechnology industries, despite a notable downturn in equity prices for such firms early in the year.”Here’s how the key ETFs for those areas are faring at last check:iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF /quotes/zigman/85342/delayed /quotes/nls/ibb IBB -0.8%Global X Social Media ETF /quotes/zigman/7289836/delayed /quotes/nls/socl SOCL -1.2%First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF /quotes/zigman/1497276/delayed /quotes/nls/fdn FDN -0.5%iShares Russell 2000 ETF /quotes/zigman/260873/delayed /quotes/nls/iwm IWM -0.6%The main indexes have been hitting session lows in the last few minutes, wiping out their early gains.S&P 500 .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX -0.02%Dow .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.1%Nasdaq .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP -0.25%Russell 2000 .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/2759624/delayed RUT -0.56%Dave Lutz of Jones Trading is highlighting biotech and social media plays as well.In emailed comments, he says watch three key ETFs — SOCL .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/7289836/delayed /quotes/nls/socl SOCL , FDN .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/1497276/delayed /quotes/nls/fdn FDN and IBB .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/85342/delayed /quotes/nls/ibb IBB .“The Fed, in its biannual report accompanying the testimony also cited social-media and biotechnology stocks as potentially overvalued,” Lutz writes.The S&P 500 has now turned negative as Yellen speaks.Hat tip goes to our Yellen live blog for pointing out this tweet:* FED’s Yellen says “equity valuations of smaller firms as well as social media and biotechnology firms appear to be stretched” – RTRS— Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) July 15, 2014So what exactly is Yellen saying?She says the Fed may have to raise interest rates sooner and higher than expected if the labor market keeps surprising, reports MarketWatch’s Greg Robb.Go here to read his story and here to follow our Yellen live blog (which includes video of her appearance).Photo credit: BloombergThe main indexes retreated from their session highs just before Yellen’s comments, then strengthened as her comments came out.But the indexes now have pulled back again to trade roughly where they were before Yellen’s comments hit.The Dow is staying on pace for a record close, holding above its July 3 record close around 17,068.S&P +0.1%Dow +0.2%Nasdaq flatYellen’s comments have just hit in the last couple of minutes, and stocks are strengthening…If you were looking for a fourth answer to that poll below in the form of  ”don’t fight the Fed,” our DC bureau has you covered.

She writes:Among those global asset allocators surveyed, a net 61% are now overweight equities. That difference between those who are overweight versus those that are underweight is the survey’s highest reading since early 2011, and the second-strongest response ever for the bank’s monthly report that takes the pulse of fund managers.So we’re been here’s some bullish articulations in recent days (See: S&P 500 has more steam left than we thought, Goldman says).

While she has generally been dovish to date, any change from that could bring a strong response from the street.  At its last meeting the Fed moved up its timetable for the end of tapering to October from the December the street had expected. Since then, US job growth has continued to accelerate and an increasing number of FOMC members have been calling for earlier action on interest rates. “The Dow hit an intraday record after a trio of data before the opening bell that traders largely took as positive:With Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen appearing before Congress at 10 a.m. Eastern, here’s how the data set her up, according to Eric Green, head of U.S. rates and economic research at TD Securities:“None of this data is a game changer, it merely reinforces what looks to be an economy gaining more traction.

U.S. risks fiscal crisis from rising debt: CBO	By Robert Schroeder, MarketWatchIn its new long-term budget outlook, the nonpartisan CBO said federal debt held by the public is now 74% of the economy and will rise to 106% of gross domestic product by 2039 if current laws remain unchanged.In its last long-term budget outlook in September 2013, CBO said debt held by the public was 73% of GDP and projected debt would be 102% of GDP in 2039.The stark warning from the CBO comes as deficits have recently been falling. For the current fiscal year, for example, the CBO is projecting a deficit of $492 billion, which would be 2.8% of gross domestic product.The deficit in fiscal 2013 was $680 billion, the first shortfall below $1 trillion of Barack Obama’s presidency. The deficit hit a record of $1.4 trillion in 2009.But the agency expects deficits to rise in coming years as costs related to Social Security, Medicare and interest payments swell.And if federal debt grows faster than GDP, that path is ultimately “unsustainable” for the economy and risks a crisis where investors would begin to doubt the government’s willingness or ability to pay its debt obligations, CBO said.“Such a fiscal crisis would present policymakers with extremely difficult choices and would probably have a substantial negative impact on the country,” the report says.The report lays bare long-term challenges for lawmakers. Spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will be 14% of GDP by 2039. That’s twice the 7% average seen over the past 40 years, CBO said.Entitlement spending has been a point of contention between Democrats and Republicans in years past as the parties have pursued deficit-cutting agreements.Washington’s budget battles have cooled down, however, as deficits have recently declined. Spending levels were set on autopilot for this year and next after a budget deal was struck late last year between House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Patty Murray, who heads the Senate Budget Committee. President Obama and House Republicans have offered budget plans for fiscal 2015, but neither is expected to advance with midterm elections approaching in November.CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf will testify before the House Budget Committee about the report on Wednesday morning. The committee is led by Rep. Paul Ryan, who was the Republican vice-presidential candidate in the last election.You can feel free and ignore Yellen’s talk todayHere’s what Charles Schumer wants to tell Janet Yellen on Tuesday	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B186AD90-0C06-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Debt held by public to exceed 100% of GDP in 2039: CBO	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Federal debt held by the public is now about 74% of gross domestic product, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday. In its latest long-term budget outlook, the CBO said debt would decline slightly relative to GDP over the next few years if current laws stay in place. However, the agency warned that growing deficits will push the debt to 106% of GDP 25 years from now as spending on health care and interest payments grows. In its last long-term budget outlook in September 2013, CBO said debt held by the public was 73% of GDP and projected debt would be 102% of GDP in 2039. CBO said the large and growing debt increases the likelihood of a fiscal crisis in the U.S., where investors would become unwilling to finance the governments borrowing needs.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=57455525-C7F1-4001-9C76-283F2FA1A11F&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
Yellen: Rate move may come sooner if labor market keeps surprising	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The Federal Reserve will have to hike interest rates sooner and higher than expected if the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated by the Fed, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee. She did stress that time has not yet arrived, and conversely, if the economic performance is disappointing, then rates will be more accommodative than currently expected. Yellen said that significant slack remains in the labor market and that most Fed officials project inflation will remain below the Feds 2% target this year. Although the economy continues to improve, the recovery is not yet complete, Yellen said. She stressed, as she has since the spring, that considerable uncertainty surrounds the outlook.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=15E3B2EB-0D54-43DD-9BBE-EA7BA9D2E9B2&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Pound rallies after U.K. inflation inches close to BOE target	By Sara Sjolin and Joseph Adinolfi, MarketWatch , Alexander MartinThe pound climbed to /quotes/zigman/4867886/realtime/sampled GBPUSD +0.3392%  $1.7142, up from around $1.7076 ahead of the data and up from $1.7088 late Monday, according to FactSet data. Against the euro /quotes/zigman/5248856/realtime/sampled GBPEUR +0.7245% , sterling appreciated 0.5% to €1.2600.The solid pound moves came after the Office for National Statistics said U.K. consumer prices rose by 1.9% in June from 1.5% in May, exceeding forecasts of a 1.6% print. Inflation in the U.K. is now very close to the Bank of England’s 2% target, raising calls for higher interest rates.“The odds are even higher now that we may get the rate hike by the end of this year, which could very well be during [the BOE] meeting in November,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in a note.The dollar is weaker against most major currencies as investors await Janet Yellen’s semiannual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday. The dollar is likely to remain weak, Aslam said in a note, unless Yellen indicates the central bank may raise rates sooner than expected.Follow Yellen’s testimony on the live blog.The dollar /quotes/zigman/4867933/realtime/sampled EURUSD -0.3840% was trading at $1.360 against the euro, down from $1.3619 Monday, and at /quotes/zigman/4868097/realtime/sampled EURJPY -0.2227%  ¥138.17, from ¥138.28.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback’s performance against six currencies, was at 80.19 Tuesday morning, compared with 80.18 Monday evening.In other currencies, the dollar remained steady against the yen after the Bank of Japan stood pat on policy following its two-day meeting.

Big banks, analysts mess with investors’ minds	By David Weidner, MarketWatchWhich is wonderful if you put a lot of stock in analysts’ estimates.To be blunt, the estimates were low. J.P. Morgan’s /quotes/zigman/272085/delayed/quotes/nls/jpm JPM +3.70%  consensus per-share number was 17 cents below actual earnings. Goldman /quotes/zigman/188479/delayed/quotes/nls/gs GS +0.80% , likewise, was expected to earn $3.05. It reported a whopping $4.10 — 34% above the prediction.The problem is that neither bank improved on last year’s second-quarter results. J.P. Morgan reported a proift of $6 billion, down $500 million from last year. Goldman performed nominally better: a $2.04 billion profit compared with $1.93 billion a year earlier. Goldman’s revenue rose 6%. J.P. Morgan reported a decline of 3%.The best you could argue is that Goldman and J.P. Morgan are holding steady.So why the lift in the shares. (Goldman was up as much as 1%, and J.P. Morgan, up nearly 4%.)It could be that the results truly are remarkable. There is an argument to be made for that. These earnings came during a quarter in which fixed-income trading and mortgage refinancing — chief drivers of bank earnings since the financial crisis — were weak. The economy, too, wasn’t growing particularly fast either. Maybe investors are rewarding the banks’ ability to weather some tough trends.Or perhaps, just as likely, investors were conditioned to expect less by the banks themselves and the analyst community. For instance, J.P. Morgan warned in May that second-quarter fixed-income and equities trading revenue would fall as much as 20%. It fell only 14%.Goldman, too, dampened the outlook on trading. Gary Cohn, Goldman’s president, warned that “our clients don’t really need to transact.” The reality: Revenue from trading dropped 10%, a decline that was smaller than those reported at J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc. /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C +1.22% , which reported Monday.To think that Wall Street institutions would lower expectations for the purpose of surprising investor on earnings day isn’t exactly a conspiracy theory. More than 60% of S&P 500 companies beat analysts’ estimates in the first quarter. Yes, the same first quarter in which the economy contracted at a 2.9% annual rate.None of this is to say there weren’t any bright spots in J.P. Morgan and Goldman earnings. Investment-banking revenue from underwriting and corporate advisory work on mergers and acquisitions was robust.

Plug Power rises after FBR starts coverage at ‘outperform’	By Claudia Assis, MarketWatchPlug /quotes/zigman/5142101/delayed/quotes/nls/plug PLUG +14.57%  is in its early stages of growth but catalysts include new orders in the U.S., a potential expansion in Europe, and the rollout of hydrogen deliveries, the analysts said.“We also view the risk/reward profile as attractive at current levels, and our blue sky scenario could result in meaningful upside,” they added. They have an $8 price target on the stock.As shares were trading at $4.64 mid-morning, that forecasts a gain of more than 70%. The company has successfully transitioned from the early introduction of fuel-cell power packs for forklifts and other warehouse equipment to offering a wide range of products and applications, the analysts said.Shares of Plug have gained 1,154% in the past 12 months, and 201% so far this year. Shares are up 22% in the past three months.This breakneck pace of gains started in late 2013 on the heels of high-profile deals with FedEx Corp. /quotes/zigman/254280/delayed/quotes/nls/fdx FDX +0.23%  and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed/quotes/nls/wmt WMT +0.22%  distribution centers. Earlier this month, it announced deals with Ace Hardware warehouses.Plug Power’s rally has boosted shares of other fuel-cell companies. FuelCell Energy Inc. /quotes/zigman/67190/delayed/quotes/nls/fcel FCEL +2.40%  rose 3.3%, and Ballard Power Systems /quotes/zigman/42601/delayed CA:BLD +7.05%  added 8.6%.Meanwhile, shares of most solar-power companies were mixed, with installer SolarCity Corp. /quotes/zigman/13139813/delayed/quotes/nls/scty SCTY -2.74%  down 2.6%.

Google team to hunt Web threats, hackers	By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatchGoogle’s /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG -1.36%  new initiative, dubbed “Project Zero,” aims to hunt cyber-threats and identify potential vulnerabilities on the Web that could be exploited by “criminal or state-sponsored” actors.“You should be able to use the web without fear that a criminal or state-sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer, steal secrets or monitor your communications,” Chris Evans, a member of Google’s security research team said in a company blog post. “Yet in sophisticated attacks, we see the use of ’zero-day’ vulnerabilities to target, for example, human rights activists or to conduct industrial espionage.”“Zero-day” threats refer to attacks on previously unknown vulnerabilities in a software application. One example is the so-called “heartbleed” bug discovered earlier this year that made large amounts of online data, including passwords, vulnerable to hackers. The flaw sent many major Internet companies scrambling to secure their networks.Google has also beefed up its encryption system to protect its network, including its Gmail service, after a massive secret government data-gathering program under the National Security System was exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.The Google team will take on threats even beyond Google products and will work with other software vendors in identifying and fixing network flaws.“We’re not placing any particular bounds on this project and will work to improve the security of any software depended upon by large numbers of people, paying careful attention to the techniques, targets and motivations of attackers,” said Evans, who also helped set up the Google Chrome security team.“Our objective is to significantly reduce the number of people harmed by targeted attacks,” he added. “We’re hiring the best practically-minded security researchers and contributing 100% of their time toward improving security across the Internet.”Google Glass pioneer joins AmazonYahoo earnings: Focus on Alibaba, display business	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B711B858-0C2F-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Treasurys fall as Yellen speaks before Congress	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe benchmark 10-year note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +0.27%  yield, which rises as prices fall, was up 1.5 basis points at 2.563%, on track for its second consecutive day of price losses. Treasury prices initially bounced higher on the testimony.The central bank chair reiterated her prior commitment to near-zero policy rates, but said the Fed could move sooner to hike rates if economic data continues to surprise to the upside. Nonetheless, she noted considerable uncertainty about the economy, and said that some stock valuations look stretched .Traders have subdued expectations for when the Fed hikes rates, especially given uncertainty about the rate-hike process. Market participants forecast the first rate hike to come in July 2015, according to CME FedWatch, which makes calculations based on fed funds futures contracts.Treasurys had fallen Tuesday after a round of strengthening economic data. Sales by U.S. retailers in June rose by the smallest amount since January. The 0.2% gains, or 0.4% excluding autos, compared with economist forecasts of a 0.6% rise in both measures. Nonetheless, the underlying numbers showed a firming in the data alongside upward revisions, according to David Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLCThe Empire State manufacturing survey rose to a four-year high of 25.6 in July from 19.3 in June.

Recap of Janet Yellens appearance before Senate	 Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen went  in front of the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday to deliver the semiannual monetary policy report. Here is a recap of MarketWatch’s Greg Robb live-blog of the proceeding.spxYour browser does not support iframes.10_yearYour browser does not support iframes.Also read: Why you can ignore Yellen’s testimonyMarket SnapshotWhat Doctor Copper is sayingGood morning.

Market is taking the news, so far, in stride, that basically if the unemployment rate keeps falling, the Fed may have to hike more.Yellen tells congress the economy still needs considerable Fed support, but flags future of policy will be set by economy’s performance.— Michael S. Derby (@michaelsderby) July 15, 2014Yellen prepared statement did not deviate from the FOMC presser. For those that think Yellen is hawkish, reading the statement is a must.— Joseph Brusuelas (@joebrusuelas) July 15, 2014Yellen series 7, 63: “prices of real estate, equities, and corporate bonds … remain generally in line with historical norms”— zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 15, 2014* FED’s Yellen says “equity valuations of smaller firms as well as social media and biotechnology firms appear to be stretched” – RTRS— Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) July 15, 2014Here’s an interesting paragraph from the semiannual report (and not in here testimony to this degree):Some broad equity price indexes have increased to all-time highs in nominal terms since the end of 2013. However, valuation measures for the overall market in early July were generally at levels not far above their historical averages, suggesting that, in aggregate, investors are not excessively optimistic regarding equities. Nevertheless, valuation metrics in some sectors do appear substantially stretched—particularly those for smaller firms in the social media and biotechnology industries, despite a notable downturn in equity prices for such firms early in the year. Moreover, implied volatility for the overall S&P 500 index, as calculated from option prices, has declined in recent months to low levels last recorded in the mid-1990s and mid-2000s, reflecting improved market sentiment and, perhaps, the influence of “reach for yield” behavior by some investors.The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and the ranking Republican stress they want a community banker appointed to the Fed board. Yellen has previously said she’s supportive of that positionHas Yellen talked the Nasdaq down? That’s now in negative territory.#Yellen tips #Fed hand toward caution on raising rates, with cautions on Q1 weakness & ongoing problems in housing market— Diane Swonk (@DianeSwonk) July 15, 2014Thomas Simons of Jefferies says:Yellen’s testimony is very close to expectations as she highlights the fact that improvements in the labor market data since her last appearance in February are mitigated by the fact that significant slack remains in the labor sector.Yellen is now reading her prepared remarks. It may take it will about five more minutes. Then we’ll get questions from the senators.Here we go on questions. Yellen to Nasdaq: “Yo”— Rex Nutting (@RexNutting) July 15, 2014Yellen says the economy is giving “mixed signals.” The GDP decline is largely due to factors that are transitory, she said, and understates the momentum in the economy.The labor market has been improving, but the Fed does need to be quite cautious with monetary policy. There have been “false dawns” before, she notes.This is what Yellen is talking about with regard to the labor market improving:The Fed needs to be sure the economy is on a “solid trajectory” before hiking interest rates, Yellen says.Pointed out to me by @joebrusuelas in the Monetary Policy Report (page 23)… pic.twitter.com/ecb3JRtFHn— Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) July 15, 2014The hit to the biotech and social media ETFs:When will the first rate hike occur?Yellen replies that almost all Fed officials expect the first rate hike will come sometime in 2015. She points again to the “dot plot” released by the Fed after the June meeting. Yellen is so torn about the dot plot. She offers it to the senators to answer their questions about the timing of the rate hikes but holds her nose while she does.There is some improvement in long-term unemployment, Yellen said. But it remains a grave concern.Yellen says “we have no specific tools to target long-term unemployment”— Aki Ito (@AkiIto7) July 15, 2014Yellen again says she would welcome a community banker to the Fed board. But she doesn’t support legislation to require a representative from the industry always be on the board. No need to lock in particular seats on the seven-member board.Making @EconomicsOne squirm, Yellen says “there is no mechanical formula” for setting the timing of first rate hike.— Pedro da Costa (@pdacosta) July 15, 2014Yellen gives a litany of the Fed’s efforts to curb too-big-to-fail. The amount of bank capital has almost doubled since 2009, she notes.Sen. Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, urges Yellen to resist pressure to raise rates. “Be very cautious,” he says.Yellen says she agrees with this sentiment. While the economy is overcoming headwinds, accomodative policy will be needed until there are “completely gone,” she adds. Schumer says he’s pleased with Yellen’s response.CFA Level 0 RT @TheStalwart: Schumer says he doesn’t think there’s a bubble in corporate bonds or the stock market.— Ivan the K™ (@IvanTheK) July 15, 2014Yellen notes there is room for faster wage growth before it would lead to inflation pressure.It would take a very significant change in the outlook to rethink an October end to QE3, Yellen said.Quick market update:S&P 500 -0.3%, Nasdaq Composite -0.7% (where the social media/biostocks live)Crude is down $1.60 to $99.31/barrel.Gold down $11.90 to $1,294.80 an ounce.Dean Maki of Barclays:Yellen did make a small change in language, suggesting that if recent labor market trends continue, it may mean that the federal funds rate would be raised sooner than currently expected. The testimony does not change our Fed forecast, but it does support our view that there is a risk that the first rate hike may occur sooner than our June 2015 forecast if the labor market continues to improve faster than the Committee expects.Yellen just discussed labor-force participation rate possibly flattening out. Here’s what it’s like now:There are substantial headwinds facing the economy, Yellen said. Consumer spending is depressed because people don’t expect  their financial conditions to improve, she says. But the economy is making progress and the day will come for the first rate hike.Productivity is low and that is a factor suppressing business investment and will be a factor holding interest rates down.These are factors in the thesis known as secular stagnation, Yellen notes. That’s why the central bank thinks rates will rise only gradually, she added.Little bit of levity in the hearing.Sen. Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, said he wouldn’t blame Yellen for wildfires out west. “I hope we are on a solid course of recovery,” Yellen said.Asked if the Fed would ever buy assets again after QE3 ends in October, Yellen says quantitative easing is a tool that may have to be used again and won’t take it off the table.Brown: Do you agree w/Fischer or Tarullo? Me: False duality! They see the issue from different angles, but are not at odds. #Fed #Yellen— Anne-Marie Fowler (@WaterAndWool) July 15, 2014Asked by Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat of Ohio, if she agees with new Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer that big banks should not be broken up, Yellen finesses the answer.She said she agrees with Fischer that financial stability is about more than too-big-to-fail institutions.But Yellen says she agrees with Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo that the Fed is “completely committed” to trying to deal with too-big-to-fail institutions.The Fed is working to reduce the odds that these big institutions will fail and to better deal with a failure if it occurs.Yellen comes out against setting a specific mathematical rule for monetary policy, as some House Republicans have proposed.It is important for a central bank to respond in systematic way, but not with a rule straight jacket, she said.Eric Green of TD Securities on Yellen’s remarks on valuation:This is a very muddled message and is evidence that she wants to have her cake and eat it too. She wants to stay cautious because her threshold of evidence for escape velocity must be higher than others, but she is coming clean in recognizing those risks. At some point she has to balance the benefit of lower rates against the limits of jawboning excessive risk taking down. Greenspan tried that in 1996 and failed.The Fed won’t be able to catch every asset bubble, Yellen said.But the central bank is attentive to the disruption that will accompany rate hikes, she adds. And making sure that banks are taking steps to prepare.A quick reminder about what the market did after Greenspan warned about Irrational Exuberance pic.twitter.com/NsTNzeR0dH— Joseph Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) July 15, 2014Hiking interest rates is not a panacea for easing financial stability risks, Yellen said. A weaker economy would bring with it new risks, Yellen notes.Here’s the Fed research showing that the long-term unemployed are finding more jobs http://t.co/QgHUXnPG2d HT @ylanmui— Matt O’Brien (@ObsoleteDogma) July 15, 2014Yellen said the pace of financial market reform has been frustratingly slow. It’s complex and the Fed wants to get it right, she says.She tells Sen. Jeff Merkeley, a Democrat from Oregon and a proponent of strong bank regulation, not to lose hope.The glass is half-full, Yellen said.The fingerprints of the financial services lobby is all over this Yellen hearing.— Brai Odion-Esene (@braiesene) July 15, 2014Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, notes that J.P. Morgan Chase has 3,391 subsidiaries.Are J.P. Morgan’s proposed living-wills credible? she asks Yellen.The Fed Chairwoman says the Fed has just been giving feed-back on the living wills. Warren says Dodd-Frank mandates that the Fed determine if the living wills are credible. If the plans are not, then the statute gives regulators the power to break up the banks. Warren notes.And with that the hearing is adjourned. Yellen will testify again tomorrow before the House Financial Services panel.Elizabeth Warren came very close to saying that Janet Yellen and the Federal Reserve are simply breaking the law on regulating TBTF banks.— Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) July 15, 2014Market update as hearing has endedS&P 500 -0.5%, Nasdaq Composite -1%10-year’s at 2.54%One note. Yellen never mentioned the stock values of social media and biotech companies in either her prepared remarks or answers to the questions from the senators.

The only thing that can extract some more details about the future direction of policy will be the upcoming data and her answers to the questions today from mostly uninformed Congress men and women.It seems like it’s going to be tough for small caps, biotechs, Internet names and social-media stocks to finish today with gains given that Fed commentary.MarketWatch’s Steve Goldstein has pointed out a key Fed quote: “Valuation metrics in some sectors do appear substantially stretched –particularly those for smaller firms in the social-media and biotechnology industries, despite a notable downturn in equity prices for such firms early in the year.”Here’s how the key ETFs for those areas are faring at last check:iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF /quotes/zigman/85342/delayed /quotes/nls/ibb IBB -0.8%Global X Social Media ETF /quotes/zigman/7289836/delayed /quotes/nls/socl SOCL -1.2%First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF /quotes/zigman/1497276/delayed /quotes/nls/fdn FDN -0.5%iShares Russell 2000 ETF /quotes/zigman/260873/delayed /quotes/nls/iwm IWM -0.6%The main indexes have been hitting session lows in the last few minutes, wiping out their early gains.S&P 500 .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX -0.02%Dow .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.1%Nasdaq .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP -0.25%Russell 2000 .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/2759624/delayed RUT -0.56%Dave Lutz of Jones Trading is highlighting biotech and social media plays as well.In emailed comments, he says watch three key ETFs — SOCL .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/7289836/delayed /quotes/nls/socl SOCL , FDN .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/1497276/delayed /quotes/nls/fdn FDN and IBB .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/85342/delayed /quotes/nls/ibb IBB .“The Fed, in its biannual report accompanying the testimony also cited social-media and biotechnology stocks as potentially overvalued,” Lutz writes.The S&P 500 has now turned negative as Yellen speaks.Hat tip goes to our Yellen live blog for pointing out this tweet:* FED’s Yellen says “equity valuations of smaller firms as well as social media and biotechnology firms appear to be stretched” – RTRS— Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) July 15, 2014So what exactly is Yellen saying?She says the Fed may have to raise interest rates sooner and higher than expected if the labor market keeps surprising, reports MarketWatch’s Greg Robb.Go here to read his story and here to follow our Yellen live blog (which includes video of her appearance).Photo credit: BloombergThe main indexes retreated from their session highs just before Yellen’s comments, then strengthened as her comments came out.But the indexes now have pulled back again to trade roughly where they were before Yellen’s comments hit.The Dow is staying on pace for a record close, holding above its July 3 record close around 17,068.S&P +0.1%Dow +0.2%Nasdaq flatYellen’s comments have just hit in the last couple of minutes, and stocks are strengthening…If you were looking for a fourth answer to that poll below in the form of  ”don’t fight the Fed,” our DC bureau has you covered.

She writes:Among those global asset allocators surveyed, a net 61% are now overweight equities. That difference between those who are overweight versus those that are underweight is the survey’s highest reading since early 2011, and the second-strongest response ever for the bank’s monthly report that takes the pulse of fund managers.So we’re been here’s some bullish articulations in recent days (See: S&P 500 has more steam left than we thought, Goldman says).

While she has generally been dovish to date, any change from that could bring a strong response from the street.  At its last meeting the Fed moved up its timetable for the end of tapering to October from the December the street had expected. Since then, US job growth has continued to accelerate and an increasing number of FOMC members have been calling for earlier action on interest rates. “The Dow hit an intraday record after a trio of data before the opening bell that traders largely took as positive:With Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen appearing before Congress at 10 a.m. Eastern, here’s how the data set her up, according to Eric Green, head of U.S. rates and economic research at TD Securities:“None of this data is a game changer, it merely reinforces what looks to be an economy gaining more traction. Yellen will focus more on how conditions are expected to evolve later in the year and beyond and these numbers neither rule out a turn lower in demand or a turn higher.”plugYour browser does not support iframes.Other big movers: GoPro Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/34007695/delayed /quotes/nls/gpro GPRO is up over 9% after an analyst initiated the wearable camera maker at a buy rating.Plug Power Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/5142101/delayed /quotes/nls/plug PLUG also got a buy rating initiation, sending the stock up 10%.Lorillard Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/511272/delayed /quotes/nls/lo LO will get bought out by Reynolds American Inc.  .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/334469/delayed /quotes/nls/rai RAI .

Why Yellen didn’t rock the markets today	By Rex Nutting, MarketWatchWe already knew what she’s was going to say because, these days, the Federal Reserve can barely shut up about what it thinks and what it plans to do.These days, Yellen has plenty of other opportunities to explain herself and the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee. The Fed chairwoman doesn’t need to wait for her ritual appearances in front of the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee. Read our full coverage.Yellen holds press conferences and conducts on-the-record interviews. The FOMC itself releases a long explanation after each meeting, and includes detailed forecasts and assumptions about the course of the economy every quarter. We even have a “dot plot” showing where each member thinks the federal funds rate will be years from now.It wasn’t always this way. It used to be that the Fed was a black box, and no one really knew what went on inside. No one even knew that the Fed had raised or lowered the federal funds rate until days later when the market figured it out on its own.To counter that secrecy, the Congress passed a law to require the Fed head to appear before Congress twice a year to explain himself or herself. The requirement was part of the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act of 1978, which is why the testimony was called Humphrey-Hawkins for so long.For years, Fed chairmen like Alan Greenspan, Paul Volcker and William Miller used their Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to send messages to the markets. The release of the chairman’s testimony to the news wires, the publication of the FOMC’s official forecasts and the chairman’s ad hoc replies to questions consumed the attention of the bond market, the stock market and the currency market.Humphrey-Hawkins Day was often one of the biggest days of the year in the markets, as the new information in the testimony forced traders and investors to completely revise their thinking about what the Fed would do.Greenspan was the master of using Humphrey-Hawkins Day to announce market-moving information.During Greenspan’s 18 years at the Fed, market volatility was about twice as great on Humphrey-Hawkins Day than it was on other days. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note moved an average of 8.3 basis points every time he testified, compared with an average daily move of 4.5 basis points during his tenure.In his six H-H testimonies from July 1995 to July 1999, Greenspan moved the 10-year yield by at least 10 basis points every time he testified. On Feb. 20, 1996, for example, it jumped 25 basis points, as much as it would have if the Fed had surprised the market with a rate hike.By contrast, Ben Bernanke’s Humphrey-Hawkins appearances hardly moved the market at all, with the 10-year yield rising or falling an average of 3.4 basis points. Bernanke moved the 10-year by 10 basis points only once: on July 21, 2009.The first time Yellen has testified, on Feb. 11, the 10-year rose by 5 basis points. This time, as of noon, the 10-year /quotes/zigman/15866666/realtime BX:TMUBMUSD10Y -0.32%   was down 1 basis point.A twice-a-year trip to the Hill just doesn’t pack the punch it once did. The Fed has found more efficient ways to communicate with the markets. And that’s why Yellen didn’t make much news, or move the markets today.Also read these stories:2 reasons the Fed may keep interest rates at zeroThe more the Fed explains, the less markets understand	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B39F9DC2-0B7E-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
What you can learn from the Comcast call from hell	By Quentin FottrellAudio: Have you ever had a cancellation as bad as this Comcast experience?“Why is it that you don’t want the faster speed? Help me understand why you don’t want faster Internet?” the Comcast customer service representative asks after Block tells him he wants to ditch the service. With cable companies aggressively trying to hold onto customers who want to switch providers or cut the cord altogether, it’s probably not the only time a customer service representative has fought valiantly (and, yes, infuriatingly) to hold onto a customer. “My job is to have a conversation with you about keeping your service,” the Comcast employee said. (A spokesman for Comcast apologized for the call and said it’s “not consistent” with how the company trains its staff.)But the call also stumbles upon a new weapon being employed by consumers, much to the chagrin of some companies: make the call, record the call and post the call (for the world to hear). By recording conversations with customer service representatives, frustrated consumers can acquire powerful ammunition to have their way, experts say. Americans may be resigned to having their phone calls recorded for “quality control” purposes and being told that they may not do the same, if they decide to ask permission. But, experts say, if one party is already recording the phone call, there may be fewer legal reasons for the other party to also seek permission to do the same, particularly if recording the call means it’s no longer regarded as confidential.The Comcast fiasco is a classic example of why companies don’t want you recording calls. While some customer service departments and call centers do use the recordings to train employees, what consumers say on the phone could also come back to haunt them later, says Glenn Conley, president and CEO of Metropark Communications, Inc., a voice and data communications company in St. Louis. Most calls between consumers and customer service staff are not just recorded for quality control, he says, but archived and used at a later date in case there’s a legal or policy dispute. “It’s more in line with covering what legal issues might arise down the road,” Conley says.Experts advise customers to do exactly what companies already do, particularly when it comes to dealing with financial companies over mortgages. “I would encourage consumers to record the calls themselves,” says Daren Blomquist, vice president at real estate data firm RealtyTrac. This is particularly important when mortgage servicing companies make promises of loan modifications to consumers. When mortgages are sold from one servicer to another, homeowners may also need to correct errors in their account. Most consumers can save emails and letters, but not phone calls. ( Also see: “What to do when your mortgage gets resold .”)Comcast’s customer service representative, however, looks tame compared with some calls consumers have grappled with in recent years. During the financial crisis, for instance, there was a spate of cases of consumers who recorded phone calls with threatening debt collectors, who called in the middle of the night and even used abusive language, says Ira Rheingold, executive director and general counsel of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, a non-profit organization in Washington, D.C. Such behavior remains unlawful under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. “We live in a world where there’s a disparity of power,” he says. “Recording phone calls is a powerful tool to hold them accountable.”Companies don’t always welcome requests to record calls. John Gill, 75, retired CEO of a consumer products company based in Osprey, Fla., recently attempted to record two phone calls — to credit card company American Express and mortgage servicer Seterus Inc. In both cases the companies said they would hang up. “Our policy does not allow customers to record phone calls,” an American Express spokesman, Thomas Sclafani, says, but customers who don’t want their phone call recorded can request to talk on a non-recorded line. Seterus, a unit of International Business Machines Corp. /quotes/zigman/230066/delayed/quotes/nls/ibm IBM -0.75%  , didn’t reply to requests for comment, but a customer service representative says it doesn’t permit customers to record phone calls.So why don’t firms want consumers to return the favor? American Express has “rigorous processes” in place to safeguard information discussed during customer calls, including account numbers, Sclafani says. “We’d be concerned about the security of that kind of information if we permitted customers to record calls.” Cliff Palefsky, a San Francisco-based employment lawyer, has another theory: “Companies control the tape and only record things that they believe will help or protect them.” In other words, they don’t want consumers producing evidence of staff making important mistakes.That said, customers only need a smartphone and Internet access to make a point. One recording with Verizon Wireless has over 23,000 views on YouTube. Querying the high cost of his bill while on a vacation in Canada, the consumer asks: “Is there a difference between .002 dollars and .002 cents?” Two customer service representatives did not see a difference, revealing a lack of understanding of basic math. (Verizon did not reply to requests for comment.) To be fair, other recordings reveal what some customer service staff endure, like this angry customer who screams, “ I am your worst nightmare .” (Warning: the recording contains profanity.)The good news for consumers: Federal law and most state wiretapping statutes permit recording if one party to the conversation — in this case, you — gives consent, according to the Digital Media Law Project, which is part of Harvard University. In many U.S. states — including New York and Ohio — customers are not legally required to ask permission to record phone calls, although recording people who are based in a state that requires the consent of both parties is a gray area. California and Washington are among states that require two-party consent. ( Read more on state-by-state laws here .)And recording calls has never been easier. Google Voice records incoming calls and, while Apple doesn’t allow the “Voice Memo” function to operate on the iPhone during a phone call, placing a call on speaker and recording it with a separate device easily gets around that. What’s more, there are a slew of apps that record phone calls like “ Record My Call ,” free for Android phones, and “ Secure Speak ” ($14.99 a month for 120 minutes), which allows recording on the iPhone by silently merging the call with a recording number and then emailing the recording to the user.(This story was updated.)Other articles by Quentin Fottrell:Who’s a bigger snoop: the NSA or your boss?5 apps for spying on your spouseWhen to refuse LinkedIn connection requests	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=352073AA-D0AE-11E3-B6BB-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Charting a bullish July technical backdrop	By Michael Ashbaugh, MarketWatchConsider that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has briefly reached all-time highs this week, while the S&P 500 Index also holds within striking distance of uncharted territory.Before detailing the U.S. markets wider view, the S&P 500’s hourly chart highlights the past two weeks.As illustrated, the S&P has rallied from recent lows, rising within view of record highs.From current levels, S&P 1,976 marks a near-term inflection point, and is followed by notable support at 1,962.Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ near-term backdrop is stronger.In its case, the blue-chip benchmark briefly notched all-time highs in Monday’s action, topping intraday at 17,088.But practically speaking, the index is challenging resistance at the range top, and its response to this area is worth tracking. To the extent the Dow holds tightly to resistance, the chances of a breakout improve.And the Nasdaq Composite’s near-term view remains jagged, but constructive.Consider that the index has rallied from significant technical support better illustrated on the daily chart below.Widening the view to six months adds perspective.On this wider view, the Nasdaq has rallied from major support at its breakout point.The specific area spans from 4,350 to the March peak of 4,371, and the Nasdaq’s successful retest preserves its uptrend. This band remains a bull-bear inflection point.Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has drawn buyers around its 20-day moving average, currently 16,928.On the ensuing upturn, the index has briefly notched a nominal record high this week. Constructive price action.And not surprisingly, the S&P 500’s six-month backdrop remains bullish.Consider that last week’s closing low held at 1,963, matching support at the S&P’s breakout point and the 20-day moving average.If nothing else, the U.S. markets’ prevailing backdrop remains technical.Starting with the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF /quotes/zigman/260873/delayed/quotes/nls/iwm IWM -1.09%  has topped this month almost precisely at all-time highs, precipitating a respectable sell-off.Still, the IWM’s 50-day moving average has marked a useful trending indicator since April, and placed a floor on the downturn last week. Practically speaking, the small-caps are range-bound, and the group’s sluggishness represents a broad-market headwind.Scaling up in size, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s /quotes/zigman/585450/delayed/quotes/nls/mdy MDY -0.55%  backdrop remains firmly bullish.As illustrated, the MDY has pulled in from all-time highs, closely observing its first significant support at the breakout point. The group’s path of least resistance points firmly higher barring a violation of this area.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=51F0DC60-0C39-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
Positives outweigh negatives for Intel ahead of earnings	By Thomas H. Kee Jr.Intel /quotes/zigman/20392/delayed/quotes/nls/intc INTC +0.32%  is scheduled to release earnings of $0.52 a share when it reports after the close on Tuesday, and if it matches earnings expectations, the company will have beaten the same quarter of the previous year nicely. However, the highest recent quarterly earnings number was $0.58 per share, so this earnings expectation, although decent, cannot be construed as outstanding.When we peel back the layers, we start to see something interesting in the longer-term growth trend for Intel. Of course, we know that growth has been declining, but recently growth actually entered negative territory. If this earnings release is in line with expectations, the trend in earnings growth will stabilize, but still it will stabilize around zero.The chart to the left compares trailing 12-month earnings-per-share (EPS) numbers on an annualized basis. For example, the trailing 12-month data from this quarter would be compared to the trailing 12-month data that existed in the same quarter of last year to determine the yearly growth rate for Intel. Given this observation, we can see that the growth rate is zero.However, Intel trades at 16.5 times earnings, and although that does not seem excessive to the naked eye, when a company is not growing, a multiple like that does seem rich to investors looking for growth. That means valuation is absolutely a concern, and unless Intel improves its earnings substantially and actually starts to grow again, concerns will increase.With that fundamental observation in tow, we can clearly make a bearish case for Intel, but at this immediate juncture, the technicals are not bearish. In fact, according to our real-time trading report for INTC, the stock recently broke above its longer-term resistance level, and that is a bullish sign. So long as the stock remains over this former level of resistance, which has now been converted into support, Intel will remain bullish according to our technical observations.There are major fundamental concerns at Intel, the stock looks very rich when multiples are compared to earnings growth, but the stock price is really all that matters to investors, and if Intel remains above recently broken longer-term resistance lines the stock is poised to move higher.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C0EA9EDE-0533-4E66-A043-7098F506A474&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
Big tobacco’s last gasp	By David Weidner, MarketWatch“I’ll tell you why I like the cigarette business,” he said. “It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. It’s addictive. And there’s fantastic brand loyalty.”The $25.7 billion acquisition of Lorillard Inc. /quotes/zigman/511272/delayed/quotes/nls/lo LO -8.23%  by Reynolds American Inc. /quotes/zigman/334469/delayed/quotes/nls/rai RAI -5.02% , announced today, comes after nearly three decades of costly litigation, suffocating regulation, higher taxes on the product, and most critically, a decline in smoking here and more recently, abroad.It’s a dying business in more ways than one.So while Buffett’s famous line may still hold some truth — cigarettes still provide fantastic profit margins — the cigarette business is shrinking. It’s losing customers the hard way. So when sales go down, companies look for ways to cut costs.That’s the real reason behind this deal. Reynolds and Lorillard have overlap in management, accounting and other areas. The combination will give the new entity pricing power with suppliers. This is good news for shareholders, and bad news for tobacco farmers across the globe.The question is how this business can survive long term. Once, Asia represented the great new market for big tobacco. Now, with higher living standards for a burgeoning middle class, Asians’ lifestyles are changing. They’re enjoying the benefits of better lives. And they want to live them healthy.For now, a deal like this helps offset the inevitable. Reynolds reported $1.8 billion in profits last year, Lorillard, $1.18 billion. Together, the new company will probably not only add those two numbers, but add a little through streamlining.Maybe they can diversify. Maybe the smoking decline levels off and there’s a few more years of profit growth. In the end, however, this deal feels more like a last gasp than a new breath of life.U.S. risks fiscal crisis from rising debt: CBO5 reasons not to retire abroadThe best way to loan your child money to buy a home	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=72D27F3A-0C37-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Since then, US job growth has continued to accelerate and an increasing number of FOMC members have been calling for earlier action on interest rates. “The Dow hit an intraday record after a trio of data before the opening bell that traders largely took as positive:With Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen appearing before Congress at 10 a.m. Eastern, here’s how the data set her up, according to Eric Green, head of U.S. rates and economic research at TD Securities:“None of this data is a game changer, it merely reinforces what looks to be an economy gaining more traction.

Tattoo removal surges 440% over the last decade	By Quentin Fottrell, MarketWatchThe tattoo removal industry is still growing and expected to hit $83.2 million over the next four years, keeping pace with growth in the overall tattoo industry, according to research firm IBISWorld. Revenue for the industry overall is estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2014, an annualized growth rate of just 2.9%, though there is strong demand for tattoos with intricate designs, such as 3-D tattoos, says IBISWorld lead analyst Andy Brennan. There are nearly 8,000 tattoo businesses in the U.S., with no dominant player.Tattoo removal can also be a public statement. Griffith was recently photographed leaving a skin specialist in West Hollywood with a bandage on her right arm and was also photographed with the outline of the heart-shaped tattoo, but the name of her estranged husband almost erased. American teens may also find a cautionary tattoo tale in pop star Justin Bieber and check their smartphones to see if he will remove a tattoo on his wrist that bears a striking resemblance to his former girlfriend Selena Gomez.Most tattoo removals are performed on people in their 30s and 40s, says Michael Kulick, a San Francisco-based plastic surgeon. “What was attractive in your 20s is not so attractive in your 30s,” he says. Costs vary from $500 up, depending on the color and depth of the ink in the skin. The ideal color for removal is black because that tattoo will be at the same depth in the skin and the same wavelength for the laser to remove the ink. “Now it’s very fashionable to have pastels and yellow, which is very difficult to remove,” he says.Relationship breakups and job-hunting has led to a surge in tattoo removals, Brennan says. “Increased social acceptability of and interest in tattoos has driven demand for them, which ultimately increased the pool of potential customers who may regret their initial decision and want their tattoos removed,” he says. Further pushing growth has been the recession, which has heightened unemployment and, in turn, increased demand from job seekers who need to cover up tattoos in order to obtain employment.Developments in technology to remove tattoos more easily and with as little scarring as possible was also a key driver of growth for removal services, Brennan says. The prospect of being able to remove them more easily simply made tattoos more tempting, he says. “Entrepreneurs and companies flocked to the industry,” he says. Although tattoos are designed to last a lifetime, in recent years scientists at Harvard Medical School, Brown University, and Duke University have engineered semi-permanent inks.There is an alternative to having them removed: Get even more to cover up the offending art. “I had a voluptuous nude fairy with wings riding a guitar on my arm from the 1980s,” says Johnny Ford , 42, a musician and New York City-based tattoo artist. “After 9/11, I had a wife and baby and thought it would be a good idea to join the army, but you’re not allowed tattoos with naked females.

Why this year’s rally is not the same as last year’s	By Kevin MarderIn accordance with most of the markets advance off the Apr. 15 lows, volume on the rebound was characteristically light, as the chart below shows.For a larger chart, please click here .Chart created using TradeStation . ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2014. All rights reserved.Within the list, technology /quotes/zigman/1475411/delayed/quotes/nls/xlk XLK -0.10%  remains far and away the leading broad sector, while among narrow groups, early cycle segments such as the banks /quotes/zigman/21809808/realtime BKX +1.45% , brokers /quotes/zigman/6015473/realtime XBD -0.10% , builders /quotes/zigman/477673/delayed/quotes/nls/xhb XHB -0.81% and retailers /quotes/zigman/478011/delayed/quotes/nls/xrt XRT -0.59% underperform.Meanwhile, despite the small-capitalization sector showing leadership during June, participants have unloaded smaller issues at a faster clip during the current market pullback. The below chart shows how the Russell 2000 index, a proxy for smaller issues, dipped to as low as its 50-day moving average (MA) last week before rebounding. By contrast, the S&P 500 held a good distance above its own 50-day MA.For a larger chart, please click here .Chart created using TradeStation . ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2014. All rights reserved.The message here is twofold. First, despite what some may say is a very different market from those seen in the past, it nonetheless fits the template of how a typical market acts technically. As one example, the rotation out of early cycle, interest-sensitive groups and into a late-cycle sector like technology is to be expected of an economy finally showing signs of better job creation. This has occurred and is still occurring.(Economic growth is more important to cyclical stocks which become more attractive relative to premium-priced growth titles.)Second, in terms of the potential reward-to-risk ratio, the 2014 market is not to be confused with the 2013 market. The latter had cheaper valuations in its favor, which created a tailwind in the form of substantially stronger volume, better breakouts, broader leadership, sizzling new issues, and, perhaps the driver of it all, boiling speculative sentiment.Less-experienced speculators using a strategy similar to the one discussed in this column may not be able to tell the difference between this year and last year. However, look closer and one notices that the leadership is much more cyclical than it is growth. This fact alone has direct implications for what can be expected from a market.Among the names, Horizon Pharma /quotes/zigman/5995570/delayed/quotes/nls/hznp HZNP -4.09% finally becomes profitable on an annual basis next year, which is likely why the stock moved from 2 to 18 over the past 12 months. Most Wall Street analysts peg this years net coming in at a loss of $1.57 per share vs. the $1.14-per-share figure expected in 2015. With one exception, the last seven quarters have shown explosive sequential revenue growth, not to mention accelerating revenue growth in the last three quarters.Stock for the developer of treatments for arthritis, pain and inflammatory diseases is ranked in the 99th percentile for relative-price strength over the past 12 months, while its industry group is ranked in the 95th percentile for relative strength.Technically, over the past four months, price has based constructively, with last week showing a bounce off the 50-day MA. The July 2 high of 16.56 could be used as a cheater entrance pivot as long as volume appears to be strong on the breakout day. Earnings are expected out in early August, so caution should be used. The HZNP metric that jumps out at the speculator is the sequential revenue growth of 117%, 25% and 72% over the last three quarters, respectively. This is explosive.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=03D92674-2C3F-47EA-B869-78153EF88E11&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Slow customer service costs you over $750 a year	By Catey Hill, MarketWatchAccording to data released Tuesday by ClickSoftware /quotes/zigman/82751/delayed/quotes/nls/cksw CKSW -0.25% , a service-management software company, Americans report spending 30.8 potential work hours a year waiting for customer service reps to respond to their requests. Considering that the average worker makes $24.45 per hour, that means waiting on customer service costs the average American $753.06 a year. The survey, conducted by Harris Poll, questioned 2,051 U.S. adults.Stephen Timms, the president of ClickSoftware’s North American operations, says this is partially because many companies are still using outdated technology, systems and processes to deal with customer service claims. And some companies, like cable and utility providers, which frequently end up on lists of the most-hated companies by consumers, often don’t have much competition for customers (sometimes people only have one choice in their area) so there may be less incentive for them to provide good customer service.Also see: The most hated cable company in America is...According to the survey, consumers say they spent the most time -- six hours -- trying to resolve their most recent issue with their bank. Timms says this is likely because banking problems tend to be more complex than in other industries. This is followed by home services/repair companies like plumbers and roofers (5.3 hours on their most recent problem), insurance companies (4.7 hours), automotive companies (3.7 hours) and health care companies (3.1 hours).The process of dealing with customer service is so frustrating that many consumers are switching companies. A survey released last year by Accenture found that 51% of customers said they had switched companies last year thanks to bad customer service, up from 46% in 2012. Their main complaints include having to contact customer service multiple times for the same reason (roughly three in four people described that as “extremely frustrating”), being on hold for a long time (69% find that extremely frustrating), having to repeat the same information to multiple employees or via multiple channels (66%) and having to deal with employees who can’t answer their questions (64%).There are things that consumers can do to get better customer service. Timms recommends contacting the company through multiple channels — online through a web chat or complaint form, through their app, on the phone and through social media — to ensure prompt service. He adds that you should make sure that your request is as specific as possible (tell them how you’ve already tried to resolve the issue — i.e. you’ve already rebooted — and what the exact issue is).Other tips: Though you want to be firm in your requests, ask nicely and remain positive, and ask to be escalated to a higher-up if your request is not being resolved.More from MarketWatch:The states workers most want to escapeThe sneakiest thing stores do to trick consumers10 cars Americans don’t want to buy	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=27DF9414-0C3B-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

But, she added, that time is not yet here.Yellen never mentioned the stock values of social media and biotech companies in either her prepared remarks or answers to the questions from the senators.

3 ways to avoid the next Cynk	By Priya Anand, MarketWatchFor the folks who actually follow penny stocks, though, this social networking company with no revenue, no assets, no real business and one employee is simply a pronounced example of an all-too-common scenario — and they say there are probably more Cynks out there than investors think.“It’s surprising to me that it’s gotten so much press coverage,” says George Kostolampros, a partner at McKenna Long & Aldridge, a Washington law firm, who served as senior counsel in the SEC’s enforcement division from 2004 to 2007. “This is sort of the bread-and-butter of fraud cases. These cases are out there all the time, and people invest in these things.”Investors have been briskly buying up penny stocks in this rallying market, hoping to snag strong returns in a relatively short period if small companies rapidly grow . But people with less-than-scrupulous intentions want in on the bull market, too. The Securities and Exchange Commission has suspended trading on such stocks about 1,300 times since May 2012. That figure comprises more than half of the cases in which the Feds have made the move since 1995.Some stock promoters touted Cynk’s shares on Twitter before news of its suspicious surge exploded. But no email spam circulated about the stock, according to the Chicago-based Internet security company Trustwave, which tracks spam — a possible indication that the SEC intervened and halted the stock at $13.90 before it could’ve reached the email spam stage in classic pump-and-dump fashion.Still, “we’re going through a greed phase now in the stock market,” says Drew Horter, a registered investment adviser and founder of Cincinnati-based Horter Investment Management LLC, and even investors who were around for the heyday of pump-and-dump penny stock scams in the 1980s and 1990s might “get caught up in emotion versus rational thinking.”“You don’t need to step outside the boundaries of common sense to make money,” he says.Here are three lessons from the Cynk debacle:1. Be skepticalIf a stock is surging by an outsize percentage, do your due diligence. It may sound like broken-record advice to tell investors to research the product they’re throwing money at, but cases like Cynk are a reminder of human nature.“These companies are penny stocks. They’re small. Call them up,” says Kostolampros, the former SEC official, and look into the background of the person telling you to invest.2. Check out the accounting firm that audited the company’s financial statements.Is it a reputable firm? In the case of Cynk, where financial statements showed the company hardly existed, this wouldn’t have helped. Even the auditor was perplexed by its $6 billion valuation. But in other penny stock frauds, Kostolampros says investors should consider the source of the audit, especially because sometimes even auditors can be duped by false financial statements.3. Turn the other way if it sounds too good to be true.“Stay away from anything that has so large of a run-up” in value, Horter says. “You’re going to be caught in a downdraft, and you’re not going to get your money back.”	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F2ECF38E-0C3D-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Long-term Treasurys swing higher after Yellen	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe benchmark 10-year note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +0.20%  yield, which falls as prices fall, was down slightly at 2.547%, even as intermediate term yields rose. Treasury prices had traded lower in the morning.The central bank chair reiterated her prior commitment to near-zero policy rates, but said the Fed could move sooner to hike rates if economic data continues to surprise to the upside. Nonetheless, she noted considerable uncertainty about the economy, and said that some stock valuations look stretched .“Our view is that they’ll move at this moderate pace,” said Mike Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors’ intermediary business. “There’s a balance between where we are from an inflation perspective – which the Fed views as modest – and the fact that while the labor market has improved, there is still slack.”Traders have subdued expectations for when the Fed hikes rates, especially given uncertainty about the rate-hike process. Market participants forecast the first rate hike to come in July 2015, according to CME FedWatch, which makes calculations based on fed funds futures contracts.Treasurys had fallen Tuesday after a round of strengthening economic data. Sales by U.S. retailers in June rose by the smallest amount since January. The 0.2% gains, or 0.4% excluding autos, compared with economist forecasts of a 0.6% rise in both measures. Nonetheless, the underlying numbers showed a firming in the data alongside upward revisions.The Empire State manufacturing survey rose to a four-year high of 25.6 in July from 19.3 in June. The U.S. import price index edged up in June.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR -0.15%  yield fell half a basis points to 3.363% and the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR +0.95%  yield rose 1.5 basis points to 1.689%, according to Tradeweb.Nutting: The Fed used to rock the markets at this time of yearWorden: In Bizarro Market, stocks rise along with pessimismStates that workers want to escape from the most	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=484EA088-0C1C-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
Amazon employees hotter than Google’s, Facebook’s	By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatchThe e-commerce company tops its two rivals in at least one area: Amazon /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN -0.25%  employees are hotter than employees from other tech giants like Google /quotes/zigman/93888/delayed/quotes/nls/googl GOOGL -0.20%   and Facebook /quotes/zigman/9962609/delayed/quotes/nls/fb FB -1.08% , according to a social networking app.The conclusion was based on data from Hinge, a New York-based social networking and dating app, which uses Facebook data to create user profiles and match young professionals.When shown a profile, a user can swipe right to indicate a desire to connect, or swipe left to indicate no interest in the person.Amazon employees turned out to be more attractive than most, with users right-swiping on their profiles about 14% more often than the average Hinge user. Microsoft /quotes/zigman/20493/delayed/quotes/nls/msft MSFT +0.74%  was at No. 2 with 8%, while Google was at 7%, and Facebook at 2.3%.Overall, employees of tech companies “on average are very attractive,” the report said.“Employees at four of the five tech companies are all more sought after than non-techie Hinge users,” the company said.There was one exception: Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL -1.17% .The iPhone maker’s employees received a score of negative 0.2%, which means “Apple is about average attractiveness when compared to all Hinge users,” the company said.The Hinge team also measured pickiness based on the rate by which users said ‘No, thanks,” by swiping left.Well, it turned out Amazon employees were the least picky, rejecting potential matches nearly 15% below the average rate.Facebook employees were the pickiest of the five tech companies, dismissing suggested matches 7.5% below the average rate, followed by Apple and Google.Karen Fein, Hinge’s marketing director, said the company did the study focused on tech companies to “raise the conversation” when it comes to dating apps.“We’re saying that there are other details that matter to determine how interested you might be in another person,” she told MarketWatch. “It’s not just about looks. ... Where you work actually impacts the way others perceive you.”Hinge, which has 14 employees, just got $4.5 million in funding from a group of investors, including Founders Fund and Lowercase Capital, the firm said.Yahoo earnings: Focus on Alibaba, display businessGoogle team to hunt Web threats, hackers	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=8A01392E-0C43-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Oil ends below $100 a barrel, lowest in two months	By William L. Watts and Claudia Assis, MarketWatchBrent crude futures ended at a three-month low.On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for delivery in August /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 -0.96%  were down 95 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $99.96 a barrel after trading as low as $99.01. That was the lowest settlement since May 6.August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -1.08%  on London’s ICE futures exchange ended off 96 cents at $106.02 a barrel. That was Brent’s lowest settlement since April 7.“Easing fears of an Iraqi supply disruption and tepid fuel demand levels continue to erase the geopolitical risk premium (Iraq and the Ukraine) that boosted both [WTI and Brent] markets to nine-month highs late last month,” said Eugene McGillan, strategist at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., in a note.Analysts at JBC Energy noted that all three major oil-forecasting agencies — the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration — have cut their forecasts for growth in oil demand this year.Libya is preparing to resume oil exports as separatists have said they intend to comply with an agreement to reopen key oil ports. Expectations for a rebound in long-depressed Libyan oil production helped push oil futures lower last week.A “closer reading” suggests, however, that plenty of supply risks remain, said Tim Evans, an energy futures analysts at Citi, in a note.“ While we don’t advise stepping in front of the decline in price, we do think that what has shifted most dramatically over the past 2-3 weeks is market sentiment rather than the actual situation on the ground, and that sentiment can shift just as dramatically to a more bullish mode without much of a transition,” Evans said.The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly report on U.S. crude oil inventories Tuesday afternoon, while the Energy Information Administration’s more influential report will be released Wednesday morning.Analysts surveyed by energy information firm Platts project a 3 million barrel drop in U.S. commercial crude-oil stocks in the week ended July 11.In product markets, Nymex reformulated gasoline blendstock for August /quotes/zigman/5926402/delayed RBQ4 -0.99%  — the benchmark gasoline contract — fell 2.65 cents, or 0.9%, to $2.8986 a gallon while August heating oil traded /quotes/zigman/9821456/delayed HOU4 -0.63%  at $2.85, down nearly 1.74 cents.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Lesson from 1996: Fight the Fed on stocks and befriend the trendSix countries that make up half the world’s population5 reasons not to retire abroad	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0D892430-0BE2-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Gold slips in wake of Yellen’s Senate testimony	By Sue Chang and Shawn Langlois, MarketWatchGold for August delivery /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 -0.93%  slid $9.60 to $1,297.10 an ounce. On Monday, prices took their hardest hit of the year, dropping 2.3% amid an investor rush into equities.Yellen, who was testifying in front of the Senate Banking Committee, said hiking interest rates is not a panacea for easing financial stability risks.September silver /quotes/zigman/12294966/delayed SIU4 -0.76%  also slipped, edging down 3 cents to $20.89 an ounce.Evan Lucas of IG Markets says that a strong earnings season is shaping up, and that will continue to weigh on gold prices going forward.“Yes, the bears will point to estimates being lowball and the market is likely to discount the results somewhat,” he said. “However, the signs are that the U.S. is standing on its own two feet after so much fiscal support.”Investors will get a clearer picture on that front throughout Tuesday’s session, with the testimony from Janet Yellen due out at 10 a.m. Eastern. Before that, retail sales for June and the NY Fed Empire manufacturing survey for July will be released.Elsewhere in metals trading, October platinum /quotes/zigman/19534176/delayed PLV4 -0.34%  fell $8, or 0.5%, to $1,485 an ounce, while September palladium /quotes/zigman/18010104/delayed PAU4 +0.37%  retreated $3.45 to $868.55 an ounce.

Apple, IBM team up to create apps, sell phones	By Daisuke WakabayashiThe deal underscores Apple’s push to expand the iPhone’s and iPad’s reach into the business world--beyond their traditional base among consumers -- while IBM looks to move more of its business software onto the mobile devices increasingly used by employees.A partnership between the two companies would have been unthinkable 30 years ago when Apple famously attacked IBM in an iconic commercial entitled “1984,” painting IBM as a big-brother-like figure protecting the status quo while Apple’s Macintosh provided a pathway to freedom.But the two companies have evolved since those days. While Apple still produces Mac computers, its main products are its mobile devices. IBM sold its personal-computer business to Lenovo Group in 2005, repositioning the company as a software and computer-services provider.“In ‘84, we were competitors. In 2014, I don’t think you can find two more complementary companies,” said Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in a joint interview with IBM CEO Virginia Rometty. “This is a really landmark deal.”The two companies said they hope to tap into the expertise of IBM’s consultants and relationships with corporate customers to create business apps that offer the simplicity -- a hallmark of Apple products -- of today’s consumer apps. The apps will draw on IBM’s computing services such as security, device management and big-data analytics. Under the agreement, IBM’s employees will provide on-site support and service of Apple products inside companies.Read an expanded version of this article at WSJ.com.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=62A2A0E4-0C60-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Stock mostly flat now.BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis tells MarketWatch, “The quarter was very unimpressive,” noting that it was the weakest GAAP revenue result since Marissa Mayer took over.“They missed on display materially,” Gillis says. “And that’s the one piece of the business they have direct control over.”Now, Yahoo “is selling less stock of Alibaba, which some people are excited about,” he added.Earnings call to start in a few minutes.Yahoo shares now down a fraction.Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said she and her team are “not satisfied” with the company’s second-quarter results.Yahoo reported a 3% drop in adjusted revenue and its GAAP net income fell 72% year-over-year.“While several areas showed strength, their growth was offset by declines,” Mayer said in a statement.  A key area of concern is display ads in which Yahoo reported adjusted revenue of $394 million, down 7% year-over-year. Analysts were expecting $426 million. “Display remains an area of investment and transition,” Mayer said. “In Q2, we saw display revenue decline, further highlighting the fact that we need to work faster to ameliorate the negative trends.”Initial reactions to Yahoo results on TwitterFair to wonder when exactly Yahoo will be judged as an online ad business again.

Its closely watched gross margin widened to 64.5%, compared with 59.6% in the first quarter and its boosted forecast of 64%, plus or minus a couple points.“Our second-quarter results showed the strength of our strategy to extend the reach of Intel technology from the data center to PCs to the Internet of Things,” Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said in a statement.Shares climbed about 4% after hours and have risen more than 20% this year.Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., supplies most of the chips that serve as calculating engines in PCs and server systems.

Treasurys fall for a second day after Yellen	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe benchmark 10-year note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +0.27%  yield, which rises as prices fall, was up half a basis point at 2.552%. Treasury prices had bounced around, but stayed near unchanged for most of the session.The central bank chair reiterated her prior commitment to near-zero policy rates, but said the Fed could move sooner to hike rates if economic data continues to surprise to the upside. Nonetheless, she noted considerable uncertainty about the economy, and said that some stock valuations look stretched .“Our view is that they’ll move at this moderate pace,” said Mike Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors’ intermediary business. “There’s a balance between where we are from an inflation perspective – which the Fed views as modest – and the fact that while the labor market has improved, there is still slack.”Traders have subdued expectations for when the Fed hikes rates, especially given uncertainty about the rate-hike process. Market participants forecast the first rate hike to come in July 2015, according to CME FedWatch, which makes calculations based on fed funds futures contracts.Treasurys had fallen Tuesday after a round of strengthening economic data. Sales by U.S. retailers in June rose by the smallest amount since January. The 0.2% gains, or 0.4% excluding autos, compared with economist forecasts of a 0.6% rise in both measures. Nonetheless, the underlying numbers showed a firming in the data alongside upward revisions.The Empire State manufacturing survey rose to a four-year high of 25.6 in July from 19.3 in June.

Hershey shares edge up after announcing price increase	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Shares of Hershey /quotes/zigman/229230/delayed/quotes/nls/hsy HSY -0.35% edged up 0.4% in after-hours trade after the company announced a price increase of about 8% for its packaged candy and grocery brand to help offset significant increases in input costs. The company said it expects to report second-quarter adjusted earnings and sales that are relatively in line with its forecasts, as it doesnt expect the price increases to have a material impact on 2014 results. Hershey expects adjusted second-quarter earnings per share of 75 cents to 77 cents, surrounding the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet of 76 cents a share. For 2014, the company now projects sales growth to be at the low end of its long-term target of 5% to 7% and expects commodity costs to be greater than previously estimated, resulting in a slight decline in gross margin.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=01978F90-FE15-46AE-9048-FF794D00B532&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Yellen will focus more on how conditions are expected to evolve later in the year and beyond and these numbers neither rule out a turn lower in demand or a turn higher.”Speaking of Yellen, here’s what could get traders yelling this a.m., courtesy of Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets:“The main event comes later this morning with FOMC Chair Yellen delivering her twice yearly testimony to Congress. While she has generally been dovish to date, any change from that could bring a strong response from the street.  At its last meeting the Fed moved up its timetable for the end of tapering to October from the December the street had expected. Since then, US job growth has continued to accelerate and an increasing number of FOMC members have been calling for earlier action on interest rates. “MarketWatch’s Barbara Kollmeyer has the deets on the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch fund manager survey, which (surprise!) shows extreme bullishness on equities.

That difference between those who are overweight versus those that are underweight is the survey’s highest reading since early 2011, and the second-strongest response ever for the bank’s monthly report that takes the pulse of fund managers.So we’ve been hearing some bullish articulations in recent days (See: S&P 500 has more steam left than we thought, Goldman says).

In his day job, he’s the founder of Pimco, the world’s largest bond fund manager.As you’ll recall, the company has been hit with investor redemptions from its flagship Total Return Fund /quotes/zigman/132344/realtime PTTRX  for over a year now. The highly-talked-about departure of CEO Mohamed El-Erian intensified scrutiny. A front-page story in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday didn’t help matters, calling attention to continued struggles to overcome recent challenges. Among the tidbits, Gross threatened to quit more than once, following El-Erian’s departure.Entirely separately, Gross also has an op-ed in USA Today about the problem of inequality. Here’s a quote:“All these statistics point to an enduring loss of purchasing power by American workers, relative to inflation and corporate profits. Wall Street can secretly slap itself on the back, but it shouldn’t. It can thrive with a more balanced partnership. It could wither without it.”File this one under: clues to the end of this bull market. Your blogger had a chance to attend a lunch with folks from MFS Investment Management on Tuesday, where chief investment strategist James Swanson had an interesting comment about how corporate credit spreads are a leading indicator of when stocks are about to turn.As you may be aware, the premium yields that investment-grade corporate bonds are paying over comparable Treasurys are very low, and junk bond yields are at record lows. That’s led some to fear a reversal.“You have to conclude that they are very rich markets and they keep tightening,” Swanson said.Once those spreads start to widen, it might be a warning sign that a turn for the worse could be coming to the stock market. In past cycles, spread widening typically took place well in advance of a hit to the stock market, with volatility picking up in between. The lesson: keep an eye on spreads. djiaYour browser does not support iframes.The Dow is trying to finish in the green, despite the red coming out of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.

The surprising impact of reinvestment QE	By Ivan MartchevI thought that if the Fed balance sheet goes from a tad over $800 billion to a tad under $4.4 trillion, reinvestment QE would go up fivefold, as that indicates $3.6 trillion in balance-sheet growth. It turns out it is quite a bit more complicated than that.The $800 billion before was deemed necessary to collateralize currency in circulation so paper money would seem less paper and more money. Since QE started in late 2008, the currency in circulation is up to $1.28 trillion, indicating the demand for hoarding cash has increased. Elevated unemployment and a lot of self-employed activities from people trying to make ends meet not always taxed properly boosts the demand for cash and cash transactions.Still, the Fed balance sheet is multiples of that cash in circulation and many investors think this indicates an impeding day of reckoning that will wipe out the dollar and cause hyperinflation. While I will be the first to admit that a mistake in the Feds gigantic monetarists machinations can have grave consequences, I have to also say dont be so fast with calls of hyperinflation.Cash in circulation does not move the economy on its own; its actually a small factor. The total amount of credit does — the old M3 — which is no longer reported, but if reconstituted, it would be north of $16 trillion. It is that M3 growth the Fed was targeting with its QE operations. Still, the money on the Feds balance sheet has no credit multiplier and no longer acts as seed money. Before interest on excess reserves, those same excess reserves in the banking system (that the Feds rising balance sheet created) were being lent in the fed funds market and circulated in the fractional reserve-banking system multiplying at a rate of 10 times, only checked by the level of required reserves also set by the Fed. While the level of required reserves has not changed, interest on excess reserves that is 25 basis points (bps) higher than the fed funds rate stops the credit multiplier process.Sure bank 1 can make loans with excess reserves, but bank 2 that sees deposit growth because bank 1 made a loan out of its excess reserves will keep that money as its own excess reserves if it cannot make a loan . That way the level of excess reserves in the system does not change and is always controlled by the Fed — this is Money and Banking 101. While those excess reserves have no credit multiplier effect, they do stimulate marginal lending — that was the whole goal of QE, to unclog the financial system so it can stop it from deleveraging and from creating even bigger problems. Now such marginal lending is accelerating, and a drainage of excess reserves by the Fed is coming sooner or later, which should be preceded by the end of this policy on reinvesting of maturing bonds from the Feds balance sheet — dubbed here for brevity reinvestment QE.So I did more research on this reinvestment QE business and came upon a staff working paper from the Federal Reserve itself: The Federal Reserves Balance Sheet and Earnings: A Primer and Projections. In it, Fed economists look at different scenarios for the normalization of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (aka, the Feds balance sheet). Enterprising minds are urged to read it in its entirety. I found several peculiar parts that I will briefly discuss below. On page 10 there is an estimate of the size of reinvestment QE that is about to be ongoing after the tapering ends:After purchases end, under the assumption that the FOMC begins to allow all asset holdings to roll off the portfolio as the first step in the exit strategy, SOMA holdings should begin to decline. However, because the Federal Reserve sold or redeemed almost all of the Treasury securities with less than three years remaining maturity in the portfolio as part of the maturity extension program in 2011-2012, the portfolio holds few shorter-dated Treasury securities at the time redemptions began. Therefore, as shown in the bottom left panel, when roll off begins in February 2015, only a minimal amount of securities are maturing, and Treasury securities do not immediately decline. As shown in Table 2, Treasury securities that are maturing become sizeable in 2016 and then Treasury holdings decline quickly.According to the Fed economists analysts of the Feds own balance sheet, there is no sizable reinvestment QE in 2015 from maturing Treasury securities. There are, of course, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that have not been listed in the above-referenced protection, but Operation Twist from 2011 that extended the maturities of the Fed balance-sheet holdings has created a vacuum of maturing bonds right at the time of QE tapering-could this be by design? According to those same economists, the Feds reinvestment program of maturing MBS should end about six months before the first fed-funds rate hike.Right now, fed funds futures indicate that the market expects fed-funds rate hikes somewhere between June and December 2015. Fed-funds futures are traded at 100 minus the expected fed-funds rate in percent. The projected fed funds rate goes from 33.5 bps in June 2015 to 79.5 bps in December 2015; currently that rate is officially targeted at 0-25 bps but spends most of its time near 10 bps.The FOMC statement that denotes the end of reinvestment QE, which surprisingly looks to not be as large as I had originally anticipated, should be the yellow flag that a rate hike is coming. The FOMCs yellow-flag statement is probably coming in early 2015 if economic conditions continue to improve. This should cause volatility in both bond and stock markets to rise as there simply will be no Fed support in the way.Implications for the dollarThe dollar has not gone anywhere in three years (see the ETF that represents the unleveraged U.S. Dollar Index). In theory, it should be having a much stronger gain as interest rates are forecast to go up in 2015. When the dollar rally starts will probably be decided by when interest rates start going up. The dollar, of course, does not move in a vacuum, as currencies are unique instruments that have no absolute value but multiple relative values against each other. In this case, this ETF is based on the U.S. Dollar Index, which itself is weighted 57% toward euros.Since the Europeans are actively trying to weaken the euro with negative deposit rates at the ECB, we have a situation where the Fed is getting ready to tighten monetary policy, and the ECB is doing the opposite. One can look at it that the Feds action will ultimately strengthen the dollar on the U.S. side and the ECB actions will weaken the euro on the European side. I would not be surprised if the dollar zooms toward the end of 2014 as the two central banks that reign over the financial systems of the worlds two largest economies — if we consider the euro zone as one economic bloc — are trying to do the same thing on both sides of the same exchange rate (since the dollar index is weighted 57% toward euros).Ivan Martchev is a investment specialist with institutional money manager Navellier and Associates.

Yahoo can keep more Alibaba shares; CEO Mayer says results disappointing: live blog	 Yahoo Inc. .bgChannel, .bgRealtimeChannel, .bgRevision { display: none; } /quotes/zigman/59898/delayed /quotes/nls/yhoo YHOO reported second-quarter results on Tuesday.The web giant reported an adjusted second-quarter profit of 37 cents a share on revenue of $1.04 billion.Tech reporter Benjamin Pimentel and tech columnist Therese Poletti are live-blogging the earnings call from San Francisco.Here’s the feed of the call, which is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. PDT. Follow Therese on Twitter @tpolettiFollow Ben on Twitter @benpimentelyhooYour browser does not support iframes.Analyst asks about the lack of shareholder returns and no revenue growth in the last two years. Mayer says this quarter included a set back in PC display ads but she feels good about the business. Goldman points out that the company has returned over $6 billion to shareholders in stock buybacks.Mayer says that this is probably the last quarter of Yahoo earnings before the Alibaba IPO. Both Mayer and Goldman talk about the great partnership the company has with Alibaba. The fact that Yahoo will sell fewer shares at the IPO is a demonstration of Yahoo’s belief in Alibaba’s future going forward. Q&A begins. Analyst asks about display ads and Alibaba.

Bank of America: Profits, sales expected to decline	By Sital S. Patel, MarketWatchEarnings: The nation’s second-largest bank by assets is expected to report second-quarter earnings of $3.16 billion, or 27 cents a share, compared to $3.57 billion, or 32 cents a share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.Revenue: The bank is expected to report a decline in revenue. The consensus estimates is $21.65 billion for the quarter, compared to $22.73 billion a year ago.Stock react: Shares have gained 1.5% so far in 2014, but are 12% below their 52-week high of $18.03 hit on March 21, 2014. Shares have lagged the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund /quotes/zigman/246222/delayed/quotes/nls/xlf XLF +0.70% , which tracks financial stocks in the S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX -0.19% , and is up 5.2% year-to-date. Analysts have an average price target on the stock of $17.44, according to FactSet. Bank of America shares closed at $15.81 on Tuesday ahead of results.Legal issues: The Charlotte, N.C.-based bank is said to be in negotiations with the Justice Department and a number of states over its handling of bad mortgage securities, according to reports. The settlement figure asked by the government is $17 billion, although talks have are said to be stalled between the two sides, according to media reports. This would be in addition to the $6.3 billion the bank settled with the Federal Housing Finance Agency earlier this year over its mortgage investments. Two mega-banks have already settled with the DOJ over similar charges. Citigroup Inc. /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C +1.80%  for $7 billion and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. /quotes/zigman/272085/delayed/quotes/nls/jpm JPM +3.52%  for $13 billion. Look for whether the bank increases reserves this quarter for this potential settlement. The Fed has 75 days to respond from the submission date of May 27. Expect news on or before August 10th.Stress tests: The bank resubmitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve in May, after the bank announced a capital error of $4 billion due to an accounting issue. The bank was forced to suspend its plan to return capital to shareholders. Look for further details on how the error was discovered and by whom, and any impact on the bank’s capital ratios.Other issues: Look for updates on expenses from a decrease in delinquencies and mortgage originations to get a sense of the mortgage market and the impact from rising interest rates on refinancing.More must reads from MarketWatch:What you can learn from the Comcast call from hellApple, IBM team up to create apps, sell phonesTattoo removal surges 440% over the last decade	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F61A2670-0B9E-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15
House passes bill funding highway projects	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill to extend federal transportation funds through May 2015. The White House on Monday backed the $10 billion measure, a move that increases its odds of passing the Democrat-led Senate. Conservative groups have slammed the bill for using what they call gimmicks, like letting corporations contribute less to pensions, which thereby boosts the governments tax revenue. Without a deal, the Transportation Department has said it would cut back on payments to states starting in August. The House vote was 367 to 55.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=7BB989F0-AD24-44D9-B767-DBC272FE6E40&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Intel CEO upbeat as earnings, sales improve	By Rex Crum, MarketWatchSpeaking on a conference call to discuss Intel’s results, Krzanich said the company “exceeded expectations” during the quarter due to improvements in the economy that drove sales in Intel’s desktop and notebook business lines.Krzanich said Intel /quotes/zigman/20392/delayed/quotes/nls/intc INTC +0.70%  was “seeing clear signs” of a refresh in the PC market for small-and-medium-sized businesses in particular, but that the consumer side of the industry “remains challenging.” During the quarter, Intel’s PC client group revenue rose 6% from a year ago, to $8.7 billion, while data center group sales climbed 19%, to $3.5 billion.Krzanich’s comments, and Intel’s results, added some credence to recent data from technology research firm Gartner Inc. that showed worldwide PC sales recorded a slight gain in the second quarter, which brought an end to two years of declines in PC shipments.In after-hours trading, Intel shares rose 4%, after the company reported a profit of $2.8 billion, or 55 cents a share, on revenue of $13.8 billion for its second quarter. During the same period a year ago, Intel earned $2 billion, or 39 cents a share, on $12.8 billion in sales. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast Intel to earn 52 cents a share on $13.7 billion in revenue.Intel also remained upbeat about its business prospects, as the company said it expects third-quarter revenue to be in a range of $13.9 billion to $14.9 billion, while analysts had forecast sales of $14.02 billion for the quarter.Along with its earnings and outlook, Intel said it would add $20 billion to its stock buyback plan, and repurchase $4 billion in stock during its third quarter.More tech news from MarketWatch:Yahoo’s Mayer “not satisfied” with company’s resultsGoogle team to hunt Web threats, hackersFormer White House press chief may be headed to Apple	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0608A776-0C64-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

Fed Chair Yellen gives investors mixed messages	By Dave Fry“If the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target likely would occur sooner and be more rapid than currently envisioned.She repeated earlier peer warnings that interest rates would rise sooner than expected if employment gains continue. This is a surprise to most traders. It seems a mathematical certainty, given how the unemployment rate is miscalculated, that the unemployment rate would fall. Yellen also noted possible overvaluation in biotech, social media and small-cap stock-market sectors, which seemed outside the Feds bounds of commentary.Later, Yellen moderated her message, merely stating the job market was still too weak.In sum, her message appeared as contradictory and convoluted as any good economist’s.There was plenty in the way of economic data Tuesday. China saw an increase in loan demand which some viewed as healthy. In Germany economic sentiment per the ZEW Index dropped to 271 vs. a prior 29.8. U.K. inflation rose 1.9%, which was substantially higher than expected. And Nomura demanded Portuguese bank Espirito Santo repay a $100 million debt. (This bad bank business in the may drip, drip, drip until the euro-zone contagion grows as before.)In the U.S., meanwhile, retail sales were weak as headline data grew only 0.2% vs. 0.6% expected and a prior 0.5%. Ex-autos & gasoline, the report was even weaker at 0.0% vs. 0.5% expected and a prior 0.3%. The Empire State Manufacturing Survey soared to 25.6 vs. 17.8 expected and a prior 19.28. Much of that gain may be due to the success of New York States promotion to move business there and gain a 10-year tax exemption. Export prices: -0.4% vs. 0.2% expected and prior 0.1%; import prices rose slightly, 0.1% vs. 0.4% expected and a prior 0.1%. Business inventories fell slightly to 0.5% vs. a prior 0.6%.Earnings news headlines included a fair report but weak guidance from Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs. JP Morgan revenues and earnings dropped 7%, which beat lowered estimates, but details were grim as around 5,000 mortgage bankers were shown the door.Leading market sectors higher included: Financials (XLF), Banks (KBE), Utilities (XLU), Transports (IYT), India (EPI) and the U.S. dollar (UUP).Leading market sectors lower included: Gold Miners (GDX), Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ), Silver Miners (SIL), Small Caps (IWM), Energy (XLE), Biotech (IBB), Social Media (SOCL), Retail (XRT), Consumer Discretionary (XLY), Consumer Staples (XLP), Health care (XLV), Australia (EWA), Solar (TAN), Russia (RSX), Germany (EWG), Austria (EWO), Spain (EWP), Gold (GLD), Silver (SLV), Crude Oil (USO), Natural Gas (UNG), and Bonds (TLT).The top 20 market movers by percentage change in volume whether rising or falling is available daily.We produced a short chart video of Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR Fund (XLY ) given the poor retail sales report.Volume increased dramatically as selling consumed trading.

Feds George says economy ready for higher rates	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The U.S. economy, with a strengthening job market and rising inflation, is ready for higher interest rates, said Esther George, the president of the Kansas City Fed, on Tuesday. In a dinner speech in Kansas City, George called for the Fed to raise short-term interest rates at a steady pace. George did not give a specific date she wanted the Fed to lift-off, but she said it should come relatively soon. The Fed must remain stoic in the face of any market volatility that stems from the tightening, she said. George, a noted hawk on the Fed policy committee, is not a voting member this year. She laid out two principles for how the Fed should approach the exit, saying the central bank should take steps to return to a Treasury-only balance sheet. At the moment, the Fed holds $1.7 trillion of mortgage-backed securities on its $4.3 trillion balance sheet. And she said the central bank should not try to use the balance sheet to control longer-term interest rates.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=07026BF4-F215-45A5-8B16-56DEC465CCF6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

China grows a little faster than expected last quarter	LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Chinas economy grew 7.5% in the second quarter from a year earlier, data out Wednesday showed, ticking up from a 7.4% expansion in the January-March period. The result just beat expectations for 7.4% growth, according to results from both Reuters and Wall Street Journal surveys of economists. The mild improvement likely reflected a raft of mini-stimulus measures announced by the government at the start of the quarter. The result was also in line with the governments target of 2014 growth at about 7.5%, as stated by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. Chinese stocks initially moved higher on the data but then quickly retreated, possibly in reaction to separate statistics on first-half housing sales, which were down 9.2% from a year earlier. Hong Kongs Hang Seng Index /quotes/zigman/2622475/delayed HK:HSI +0.16% was up 0.1% compared to a 0.3% gain ahead of the numbers, while the Shanghai Composite /quotes/zigman/1859015/delayed CN:SHCOMP -0.11% was down 0.1%, swinging from a pre-data gain of 0.1%. The Australian dollar /quotes/zigman/4867876/realtime/sampled AUDUSD -0.3555% also fell, dropping to 93.53 U.S. cents from 93.63 U.S. cents minutes earlier.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=788BD2A1-1078-4C59-AF2C-D88B283EEF10&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-15

It said it opposed interference by Vietnam and had taken “necessary measures to safeguard the safety of operations” by COSL.Vietnam protested Chinese drilling in the area after it began in early May and has sent coast guard vessels to confront the rig.

Chinas June data relatively strong, but markets slip	LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Chinese economic data for June, released Wednesday morning, printed mostly above forecasts, though the numbers failed to lift markets in the face of a separate report showing a drop in housing sales. Industrial output rose by 9.2% from a year earlier, accelerating from Mays 8.8% growth and besting an expected gain of 9% according to respective surveys of economists from The Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Urban fixed-asset investment, watched as a measure of construction activity, was up 17.3% for the January-June period, slightly ahead of forecasts that the measure would remain at the 17.2% level recorded in the January-May print (fixed-asset investment is reported on a year-to-date basis). Retail sales for June rose 12.4%, as tipped in the Reuters and Wall Street Journal polls, slowing a little from Mays 12.5% increase. However, the data were quickly followed by other numbers on Chinas housing market for the first half of the year, which showed housing sales down 9.2% from a year earlier. Likely because of this, Hong Kongs Hang Seng Index /quotes/zigman/2622475/delayed HK:HSI +0.02% trimmed its 0.3% pre-data gain to 0.2%, while the Shanghai Composite Index /quotes/zigman/1859015/delayed CN:SHCOMP -0.37% traded fractionally lower, swinging from a 0.1% gain. The Australian dollar /quotes/zigman/4867876/realtime/sampled AUDUSD -0.3668% , often sensitive to Chinese economic data, fell to 93.44 U.S. cents from 93.63 U.S. cents, while Australias S&P/ASX 200 stock index /quotes/zigman/1653884/delayed AU:XJO +0.0018% was down 0.1% after trading flat before the release.

China GDP beats, but will there be more stimulus?	By Michael Kitchen, MarketWatchThe uptick in Chinese gross domestic product growth surpassed forecasts that expansion would hold to the 7.4% rate seen in the first quarter, according to separate surveys of economists from Reuters and The Wall Street Journal.The result was also in line with the government’s target of 2014 growth at “about 7.5%,” as stated by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.The mild improvement likely reflected a raft of “mini-stimulus” measures announced by the government at the start of the quarter, and while most economists saw the latest GDP number as positive, they disagreed over whether it was strong enough to exclude more such stimulus support going forward.China’s economic growth “this year looks set to remain close to the official government target of 7.5%, [and] subsequently the recent data flow does not demand any type of ‘stimulus package’ or more broad-based easing,” wrote TD Securities head of Asia research Annette Beacher.Beacher said that the second-quarter GDP also “confirmed that once again a ‘Chinese hard landing’ remains a distant tail risk.”However, economists at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch weren’t so sure, saying that “there are still strong headwinds as a consequence of the anti-corruption campaign and property downturn.”Given a high comparison base with last year, China’s economy would need to grow 2%-2.1% on a quarterly basis to hit the 7.5% annual target, the Merrill Lynch team said. Compared to the previous quarter, April-June GDP rose 2%.“We believe Beijing is quite serious about its 7.5% growth target as it needs a stable economic and financial backdrop as it steps up its anti-corruption campaign, so the new government will most likely continue its mini-stimulus in the face of higher base effect and some strong headwinds” in the second half of the year, they wrote.In any case, the GDP data were strong enough to prompt Australia & New Zealand Banking Group to revise its full-2014 China growth outlook to 7.5% from 7.2% previously, even as it predicted Beijing would lower its GDP expansion target to 7% for next year.The GDP print came amid a gush of other data also released Wednesday, with strong numbers for industrial and retail activity in June but a weak report on housing sales.Industrial production — which according to Reuters, accounted for 45% of China’s economy in 2012 — surprised to the upside, rising by 9.2% from a year earlier against an expected gain of 9%, according to the surveys from The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.The improvement also marked an acceleration from May’s 8.8% growth.However, data for the real-estate sector, also crucial to the Chinese economy, showed further declines.Housing sales for the first half of the year were down 9.2% from the same period in 2013, though the figure represented a modest recovery from the 10.2% year-on-year drop for the January-May period. (Chinese housing data are reported on a year-to-date basis.)	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E26AA5F6-0C9C-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Dollar extends gains after Yellen’s comments	By Hiroyuki KachiThe dollar most recently rose to ¥101.70 compared with ¥101.68 late Tuesday in New York. Meanwhile, the euro fell to $1.3537 from $1.3568.The greenback’s rise during Asia session tracked its overnight gain in the wake of comments by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen that interest rates would climb earlier and faster than expected if U.S. data on inflation and employment continue to improve.“If the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated by the (Fed) ... then increases in the federal-funds rate target likely would occur sooner and be more rapid than currently envisioned,” she told the Senate Banking Committee. The Fed has held its benchmark short-term rate near zero since late 2008.The dollar /quotes/zigman/4868099/realtime/sampled USDJPY +0.0430%  went as high as ¥101.78 in mid-morning before turning top heavy. Market participants pointed out that selling orders are stacked up around ¥101.80-¥102.00, keeping a lid on further gains.“U.S. interest rates are unable to rise successfully,” said Kyosuke Suzuki, head of FX and money-market sales at Societe Generale. “With groundwork to allow the dollar buying not being set, it is hard to expect the situation to lean toward a stronger dollar this week.”Mr. Suzuki expects the greenback to trade in a tight range of ¥101.20-¥102.00 for the rest of the week.Given the recently stronger correlation between the dollar-yen and U.S.-Japan interest-rate differentials, the reaction of U.S. long-term rates to economic data needs to be closely monitored, said Junya Tanase, chief FX strategist at J.P. Morgan.The dollar could go either way against the yen over the short term, but is more likely to fall, given strong downside pressure on U.S. Treasury yields and weakness in the dollar across the board, Mr. Tanase said.Investors may need to be more cautious about the risk of a dollar-yen fall in the case of weak U.S. economic data such as producer prices, industrial output and capacity utilization, later Wednesday, he said.In other currency trading, the euro /quotes/zigman/4868097/realtime/sampled EURJPY -0.2084%  fell to ¥137.65 from ¥137.96.The WSJ Dollar Index /quotes/zigman/9625991/realtime XX:BUXX +0.15%  , a measure of the dollar against a basket of major currencies, was up 0.1% to 73.10.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Recap of Janet Yellen’s appearance before SenateDecoding Yellen: Sooner rate hike means March at the earliestChina GDP beats, but will there be more stimulus?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CBA89E5C-0CAD-11E4-98A7-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Oil futures rebound on China data, U.S. supplies	By Eric YepOn the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for delivery in August /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 +0.69%  traded at $100.39 a barrel at 0501 GMT, up $0.43 in the Globex electronic session. August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 +0.18%  on London’s ICE Futures exchange rose $0.07 to $106.09 a barrel.China’s economy grew 7.5% in the second quarter, compared with 7.4% in the first quarter, marginally topping market expectations of 7.4% growth.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported a 4.8 million-barrel drop in U.S. oil stockpiles for the week ended July 11. The more closely watched data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later Wednesday and analysts expect an inventory drop of 2.6 million barrels.The August contract for Brent crude is set to expire today. Morgan Stanley had said in its weekly commodity manual that Brent faced selling pressure in the short term through the August expiry. The physical market appeared oversupplied for now as crude loadings rebounded at a time of poor refining margins, and the issue was further compounded by the reopening of Libyan ports, it said.“As a result, finding buyers willing to take delivery of Brent going into expiry may be difficult,” Morgan Stanley said.Meanwhile, Libya’s oil production has reportedly risen to about 554,000 barrels a day as production ramps up faster than expected at the country’s largest field Sharara, an oil official said Tuesday.Nymex reformulated gasoline blendstock for August /quotes/zigman/6362154/delayed RBU4 +0.39%  --the benchmark gasoline contract--rose 92 points to $2.9078 a gallon, while August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821456/delayed HOU4 +0.0035%  traded at $2.8572, 17 points higher.ICE gasoil for August changed hands at $881.00 a metric ton, up $7.50 from Tuesday’s settlement.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Why your morning corn flakes could milk your moneyCharting a bullish July technical backdrop	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B4D51CF8-0CB4-11E4-98A7-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
America’s biggest untapped market is hiding in plain sight	Until recently, corporations, marketers and entrepreneurs paid little attention to men and women aged 50 and over. There was, after all, little to spark their interest in a group whose members were thought to be frugal and set in their ways. But now marketers are realizing that they can no longer afford to ignore adults.Madison Avenue bears its share of the blame. Big advertising has bred notions about older people that simply don’t hold true for baby boomers who reflect the new face of aging. What’s required to reach them, and too often missing, is a broader understanding of the Age Wave and how to appeal to this group that differs so dramatically from their parents and grandparents — in both longevity and lifestyle.Boomers are transforming aging, defining it with more vigor, motivation and purpose. They don’t aspire to the old retirement dream dominated by idle leisure, even disengagement. Most intend to work well into their traditional retirement years, many by choice. They return to school, start new careers, volunteer in their communities, and seek purposeful activities.As a group, the 78 million-strong boomer generation has unrivaled amounts of money to spend. Representing 32% of the U.S. population, Americans aged 50+ currently earn almost $2 trillion collectively in annual income, and control 77% of the total net worth of U.S. households — almost $46 trillion. Even though boomers are largely ignored by advertisers, they represent 50% of all discretionary spending power. In fact, their per capita discretionary spending is 2.5 times the average of younger households.Because of their demographic’s huge size, when they reach any stage of life, boomers create huge opportunities for companies that can meet their needs — whether financial, interpersonal, or even hormonal. For example, boomers didn’t just eat food — they transformed the snack, restaurant, and supermarket industries; they didn’t just wear clothes — they changed the fashion industry; they didn’t just go to work — they disrupted the workplace; they didn’t just go to the doctor — they altered health care.And boomers won’t simply grow old. They will transform aging itself.The ‘Age Wave’ is comingAs the boomers mature, five key factors will reshape America’s marketplace for goods and services — and how and where you invest:1. Boomers are going to live longer than any group ever hasA 90- or 100-year lifespan will become commonplace. And as they search for the “fountain of health,” they will try all sorts of things to stay healthy and young longer. Watch for growth in anything and everything that can forestall or minimize physical aging — from joint replacement surgeries to vitamin supplements, nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals to botox skin treatments and anti-aging spas and/or medical clinics.2. Boomers will reinvent themselves again and againThey changed majors in college and haven’t stopped shape-shifting since. Twenty percent have changed religions and 50% have changed spouses. They are also far less likely than previous generations to be brand loyal — and far more open to new ideas and products. This appetite for trying new things and lifelong learning will not only propel the tech industry (for everything from mind-expansion software to smart homes), but will breathe new life into colleges and universities both as centers of adult learning as well as retirement housing meccas.3. New adult life stages will require a wide range of products and servicesFor example, the “empty nest” life stage will unleash an abundance of “discretionary time” — to be filled with everything from walking tours of Europe to cooking classes at the local Y. And watch for grandparents to be the power consumers of everything from toys to college tuitions to starter homes — for their progeny.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9DCBA8CE-0BB0-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Cruise industry woos solo travelers	But there are quite a few reasons why cruising solo may be more appealing, and less expensive, than in the past. Boomers represent more than 50% of cruisers overall, according to  Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the cruise industry trade organization, and some CLIA members say as many as 10% of their passengers are solo travelers.“We’ve seen a jump in solo travelers,” says Priscilla O’Reilly of  Grand Circle Cruise Line , which owns and operates a fleet of 15 small ships and riverboats. “Today, solo travelers represent one out of four passengers on our line, up from one out of five only five years ago.”Predictably, both large cruise ships and riverboats are expanding their efforts to woo this growing market segment.An important note: Many people confuse solo cruising with themed singles cruises. Solo cruisers opt to travel alone and aren’t necessarily interested in connecting socially with other single people. “Singles cruises” are organized to connect singles with other unmarried people for romance or friendship.Why cruising can be idealCruising eliminates many of the hassles typically associated with travel, which can be more stressful when you’re alone:Passengers aren’t burdened with the logistics of arranging for hotels, excursions and transfers.Cabins are a “home away from home” for the entire length of the journey; you pack and unpack once.Cruisers experience the safety and security of being part of a group — with plenty of crew onboard to tend to their needs — but can also spend time alone.All-inclusive pricing on some lines helps control costs and can add convenience; no reaching for your wallet each time you want a snack or drink.Chuck Flagg, who owns a Cruise Holidays franchise outside Atlanta, says he sees solo travelers checking destinations off their bucket lists. Cruises can make a travel goal easy. “This ranges from seeing the tulips blossom in Holland, to visiting the Galápagos Islands, to Russian River cruising to setting foot on Antarctica,” Flagg says.A growth in single roomsHistorically, one of the biggest barriers to solo cruising has been the “singles supplement,” a hefty surcharge imposed on single travelers. “The cruise industry, as a rule, bases pricing on two people in a stateroom,” Flagg says. The normal supplement is 200% of the cruise fare.But with a growth of single travelers, the industry is changing.For one, single cabins are becoming more common. Norwegian Cruise Lines has been a pioneer in designing cabins for solo cruisers. The modern 100-square-foot studio staterooms on some of its newer ships are specifically designed for singles; they open to a common lounge area — a virtual living room where passengers can meet for a drink, watch TV or chat.In June, Cunard, owned by Carnival Corp. /quotes/zigman/322132/delayed/quotes/nls/ccl CCL -0.76%  , announced it was adding single staterooms with oversize windows on its refurbished Queen Elizabeth. Riverboat cruises, another growing area, also offer single cabins on some ships.Experts recommend solo cruisers book early. Because the number of single staterooms (on cruise ships and riverboats) is limited, these cabins often sell out quickly.Comparison shop on single supplementsIf you do book a double cabin, you may relish the extra space. But it comes at a price. Check around, because single supplements vary widely.“I have seen everything from the supplement being waived in the case of some river cruise lines to ones as low as 150% of the per-person rate,” says Flagg. “Lower rates often appear about 45 days before sailing,” he says.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0C11616E-07E4-11E4-87AC-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew sounds alarm on cyber intrusions: live blog	CNBC’s Delivering Alpha hedge fund conference is under way in New York. We’ll be hearing from a number of industry heavyweights, including John Paulson, Leon Cooperman and Carl Icahn. MarketWatch’s Sital Patel and William Watts are live blogging the event here.Tax inversions are something that can’t be addressed by administrative action, Lew says.Moving away from cybersecurity, what about inversions?Lew says he’s calling for “economic patriotism” and emphasizes a call for “comprehensive business tax reform.” If that can’t be done quickly, something else needs to be done to shut the door on inversions.Lew says he expects to see more activity where false information is put out via social media. There needs to be an end to the taboo against disclosing breaches.Lew ends prepared remarks and sits down for a Q&A with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, who asks the Treasury secretary whether he used his cell phone while in China.Lew says he did, but that he’s always cautious when he does so.Lew says cyber security must be the responsibility of “management at all levels.”Many firms are reluctant to report cyber security breaches out of fear of damage to their reputations, but this has to stop, Lew says. He also calls on Congress to pass tougher cyber security legislation.Firms need to be aware not only of counterparties’ financial risk, but also their cyber security risk, Lew says.There have been more than 250 distributed denial of service attacks against U.S. financial institutions since 2011, Lew says. So far, they’ve made life inconvenient for banks and their customers, but the risk of a “catastrophic” attack can’t be ignored.We’re under way and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is focusing on the threat of “cyber intrusions.”The Tell is MarketWatch’s fast and engaging look at trends and themes in the day’s markets.

A German recession would put the euro back in danger	By Matthew LynnAnd yet, look under the bonnet, and there are some troubling signs. Industrial production is falling. Exports are down. Wages are stagnating. The inflation rate is so low it may soon slip into outright deflation. By the third quarter of this year, it looks as if Germany will be in recession.That will change the dynamics of the euro zone, and not for the better.Until now, the single currency, while it has been a catastrophe for the peripheral nations of southern Europe, has worked well for Germany. And Germany is by far the strongest power within the European Union. Not surprisingly, it has been doing everything in its power to keep the euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/realtime/sampled EURUSD -0.2867%   together.But once it gets hits by the currency just like many others, that will inevitably change. With a weakening Germany, the euro will look a lot more fragile than it has for the past year.The signs of a slowdown in the German economy are not hard to see.Last week, we learned that industrial production — which matters a lot more in Germany than it does in most other major advanced economies — shrank by 1.8% in May compared with April. Construction, often a good leading indicator of where the economy is going, was down by 4.9%.Both imports and exports fell in May, hardly an indicator of an economy that is booming. On an adjusted monthly basis, exports were down 1.1% month-on-month, as other countries stopped buying as many German-made cars and chemicals, while imports dropped by 3.4%, as factories looked at their order books and decided they didn’t need so many raw materials, while squeezed consumers did a bit less shopping. The country still racked up a big trade surplus — but there is not much good in that if all it reflects is that imports are shrinking faster than exports.Other indicators are not much better. Inflation is slumping, as it is right across the euro zone. For June, it was running at annualized rate of just 1%, and in May it was only 0.6%. As a general rule, companies don’t moderate price rises because demand is too strong — usually it is because it is too weak. That was reflected in the retail sales figures for May. They were down by 0.6%, following a 1.5% fall in April.Most economists are still forecasting a decent rate of growth of around 2% for Germany this year. But not everyone. High Frequency Economics is predicting a contraction in the Germany economy for the second quarter of the year. Keep that going for two quarters in a row, and that is a recession.The bond markets, which are usually a lot better at spotting trouble ahead than most others, have already noticed that something is up. The yield on a 10-year bund, as German government bonds are known, have been falling steadily all year and it is now down to 1.2%, very close to its all-time low. Bond yields don’t fall when an economy is expanding strongly. They drop because the smart money thinks recession and deflation are just around the corner.It is not hard to figure out what is going wrong. There is a lot of hype about the formidable German industrial machine, and while it has many excellent companies, basically it is workshop for the rest of Europe. Of its exports, 69% go the rest of the continent. Its biggest trade partner is France, which alone accounts for 9.2% of German exports. Asia has been growing, but it still accounts for only 16% of what the country sells overseas.And Europe, of course, is a terrible market right now, and not about to get better any time soon.Just take France, for example. Since 40% of German gross domestic product is made up of exports, and a tenth of those go straight across the border to France, its neighbor by itself accounts for 4% of Germany’s GDP. And the French economy is stagnant, with sales and confidence slipping month by month.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=51B45F66-0C24-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
U.S. wholesale prices resume upward trend in June	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - U.S. wholesale prices rose in June to more than overset a surprise drop in the prior month, as the cost of energy surged, the government said Wednesday. The producer price index increased a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in June after a 0.2% decline in May, the Labor Department said. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had predicted a 0.3% increase in the PPI. Excluding the volatile categories of food, energy and trade, core wholesale prices rose a smaller 0.2%. The price of goods advanced 0.5% in June, led by the biggest increase in gasoline since the fall of 2012. Wholesale drug prices also rose sharply. Yet the cost of food fell 0.2%, mostly because of lower grain and cheese prices. Services prices moved up 0.3%. Wholesale prices have risen an unadjusted 1.9% in the past 12 months, down from a two-and-a-half year high of 2.1% in April. Personal consumption, an index designed to foreshadow changes in the consumer price index, rose 0.5% in June. The personal consumption index is up 2.2% in the past year.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B3EE9380-46FA-4327-96AE-0E02374FE8F5&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Unemployment for the three months to May dropped to 6.5% from 6.6% in April, but wage growth slowed to its weakest pace since comparable records began in 2001. The Bank of England has signaled it wants to see a stronger rise in incomes before raising rates, and the weak salary data could ease pressure on the central bank to hike interest rates this fall.Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said in a note that the weak earnings growth seems to be biased down by a surge in incomes a year ago due to a change in taxation. If the current level of pay remains at these levels, earnings growth should recover in August, he said.“Unless the economy and the labor market suddenly change direction, we continue to expect the first policy tightening to take place in November this year,” Shaw said.Inflation data out on Tuesday showed faster growth in consumer prices than expected, raising calls for BOE Governor Mark Carney and fellow bank officials to tighten policy.

Our Market Society has made a deal with the devil	By Paul B. Farrell, MarketWatchBut for the rest of the world, capitalism’s a losing bargain with a devil: Why? A billion people live on less than two dollars a day. With global population exploding to 10 billion by 2050. Thomas Piketty warns inequality between the rich and the rest will get wider, more dangerous. Pope Francis warns “Inequality is the root of social ills,” fueling killings, wars, revolutions.For years we’ve been asking: Why does capitalism blindly drive the human brain down this self-destructive path, whether it’s money, global warming, gun sales or voting rights? Why more books and ministers filling arenas with the message, God Wants You to Be Rich? Why is Pope Francis warning that a new “worship of the ancient golden calf has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money and the dictatorship of an impersonal economy?” Why?There is someone who brilliantly explains why free-market capitalism is controlling our brains, sabotaging our world: Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel, author of bestseller “What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets, and Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?”For more than three decades Sandel’s been teaching us why capitalism is undermining human morality. And why we choose to deny it. Why do we bargain away our moral soul? His classes number over a thousand. You can even take his course online free . He summarized capitalism’s takeover of the human conscience in “What Isn’t for Sale?” in the Atlantic. Listen:“Without being fully aware of the shift, Americans have drifted from having a market economy to becoming a market society ... where almost everything is up for sale.” Capitalism is America’s new “way of life where market values seep into almost every sphere of life and sometimes crowd out or corrode important values, non-market values.” His course should be required for Wall Street insiders, corporate CEOs, and all 95 million Main Street investors.Here’s an overview: “The years leading up to the financial crisis of 2008 were a heady time of market faith and deregulation — an era of market triumphalism,” says Sandel. “The era began in the early 1980s, when Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher proclaimed their conviction that markets, not government, held the key to prosperity and freedom.”Then in the 1990s the “market-friendly liberalism of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair ... consolidated the faith that markets are the primary means for achieving the public good.” Yes, Ayn Rand’s “pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism” took over America’s brain, our soul, became the nation’s collective unconscious. For both the GOP and Dems.Today “almost everything can be bought and sold,” warns Sandel. “Markets, and market values, have come to govern our lives as never before.” Yet few are aware of this historic shift. “We did not arrive at this condition through any deliberate choice. It is almost as if it came upon us,” says Sandel.As a result, “market values were coming to play a greater and greater role in social life. Economics was becoming an imperial domain. Today, the logic of buying and selling no longer applies to material goods alone. It increasingly governs the whole of life.” Everything has a price.Examples everywhere: “For-profit schools, hospitals, prisons ... outsourcing war to private contractors ... police forces by private guards ... drug companies aggressive marketing of prescription drugs prohibited in most other countries.” Ads in “public schools ... buses ... corridors ... cafeterias ... naming rights to parks and civic spaces ... blurred boundaries within journalism, between news and advertising ... buying and selling the right to pollute ... campaign finance in the U.S. that comes close to permitting the buying and selling of elections.”But the 2008 crash ended our faith in conservative free-market capitalism: “The financial crisis did more than cast doubt on the ability of markets to allocate risk efficiently. It also prompted a widespread sense that markets have become detached from morals,” says Sandel. But so what? “Why worry that we are moving toward a society in which everything is up for sale?”Two big reasons concern Sandel, both echo the warnings of Pope Francis and Piketty: One is inequality: “Where everything is for sale, life is harder for those of modest means.” If wealth just bought things like yachts inequalities might not matter. “But as money comes to buy more and more, the distribution of income and wealth looms larger.” Second, corruption: “Putting a price on the good things in life can corrupt ... the meaning of citizenship.”	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=1B919502-0C4C-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

How much do you spend bribing your kids?	By Christine DiGangi, Credit.comKids on their parents’ payroll are doing all right: The average child 10 years old or younger receives $1,360 a year in allowance, bribes, rewards and gifts from his or her parents, or about $113 a month, according to a new survey from coupon site Voucher Cloud. The data was drawn from polling 2,174 American parents of children between 5 and 10 years old. The margin of error for this sample is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.Parents feel pressured to pay childrenThe majority of moms and dads in this survey (71%) said they regularly give their kids money, and they shell out cash for a variety of reasons: 77% give a monthly allowance, 61% give money as a reward for good behavior and achievements, 55% say the cash is a bribe to make kids behave better, 46% give cash for birthdays and holidays, and 44% pay their children for doing chores.To pay each kid about $100 a month can take a huge chunk out of parents’ budgets, and they know it. The majority of parents surveyed (65%) said they would like to give their children less money, but they feel obligated to dole it out. Of the parents who wished to provide their kids less cash, 45% said they feel like they’re competing with the parents of their children’s friends, 24% said they don’t want to disappoint their children, and 17% said their children like expensive things and need enough money to buy them.Paying kids versus paying debtAn extra $100 a month can make a huge difference for a family with debt obligations. If you’re trying to find a way to cut back on monthly expenses, your kids’ allowances should be an easy place to start. Here are a few things you can do with that extra cash :If your finances are in tip-top shape, then sure, giving children allowance makes sense. As far as bribes go, that’s probably not the best strategy for teaching kids about money, but all parents are entitled to employ their chosen child-rearing techniques.At the same time, if you have debt, flexible parts of your budget (like giving your kids cash) should be the first to go toward tackling those bills. The longer debt goes unaddressed, the more expensive it will become, and if you’re planning on paying for your children’s college later on, you may find yourself unable to contribute because you have years of interest charges to reckon with.Budgeting requires thinking about the future. If you want to give your children monetary rewards, that’s fine, but you should make sure it’s the best use of your money. Check your credit scores to see if you have areas for improvement ( you can do so for free through Credit.com ), and if you see the need to work on your debt management, take that as a sign you need to re-evaluate your finances. You can even use the change in cash flow as a teaching opportunity -- your kids need as much financial education they can get.More from Credit.com:A Simple Checklist to Get Out of DebtHow to Improve Your Credit ScoreDoes Checking My Credit Score Hurt My Credit?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=DA3CF4A6-0C60-11E4-A2D9-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Bank of America profit falls 43% on legal charges	By Saabira ChaudhuriShares rose 1.6% and then quickly reversed course in recent premarket trading as investors digested the legal charge and a somewhat messy earnings comparison.The bank said it had reached a $650 million deal with American International Group /quotes/zigman/557836/delayed/quotes/nls/aig AIG -0.09%   to resolve all outstanding residential mortgage-backed securities litigation.Charlotte-based Bank of America /quotes/zigman/190927/delayed/quotes/nls/bac BAC +1.54%   reported a profit of $2.29 billion, compared with $4.01 billion a year earlier. The results include a litigation charge of $4 billion, up from a year earlier charge of $471 million. On a per-share basis, earnings were 19 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected seven cents a share including litigation.Revenue dropped 4.3% to $21.75 billion, topping analysts’ expectation of $21.61 billion.Bank of America’s second-quarter litigation expense is on the high end of what many on Wall Street had expected. Litigation expenses were also a key part of last quarter’s earnings, when the bank set aside $6 billion, higher than analysts were expecting and enough to push results into the red. Much of the money was set aside for an expected mortgage-securities settlement with the Justice Department, which is still pending three months later.That deal is, the bank hopes, one of the last big pieces of crisis-era litigation that it has to work through, though Bank of America and the government still remain far apart on how much the lender should have to pay. The Journal reported last month that the bank has offered to pay some $12 billion, which would include both cash and consumer relief, but the Justice Department has demanded billions more. Citigroup Inc. /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C +1.80%  settled its mortgage-securities probe with the Justice Department this week, and J.P.

There’s a big hole in the bull case for stocks	By Mark Hulbert, MarketWatchCHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — Some say the stock market’s high price-to-earnings ratio is justified by low interest rates.That seems plausible, right? Think again. There is precious little historical support for this notion.To be sure, virtually everyone I hear from or talk to is certain that above-average high P/E ratios are justified by low rates. The belief is so widespread on Wall Street that few have bothered to examine the historical record.If they did, they would be very surprised indeed.One analyst who did take the trouble to do so is Clifford S. Asness of AQR Capital Management. More than a decade ago, he published his analysis of data extending back more than a century. Titled “ Fight the Fed Model ,” his study appeared in the fall 2003 issue of the Journal of Portfolio Management.Asness’ findings are best understood in terms of a statistic known as the “R-squared,” which reflects the degree to which fluctuations in one thing predicts or explains changes in another. The R-squared ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating the highest possible degree of predictive power and 0 meaning there is no detectable relationship.The table reports the R-squareds that Asness derived from tests covering 1926 to 2001. Notice that, regardless of whether you’re using the P/E to forecast the market’s one- or 10-year return, you’ll do a whole lot better by not adjusting it according to prevailing interest rates.That is bad news for today since the stock market’s current P/E is well above the historical average. Based on trailing 12-month earnings, the S&P 500’s current P/E is 19 — 23% higher than the 15.5 average since 1871. The cyclically adjusted version of the P/E — the one championed by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller of Yale — stands at 26, which is 56% higher than the long-term average.How did anyone ever come to believe that the P/E should be adjusted by interest rates? I can think of two possible explanations: one based on lazy thinking and the other on Wall Street’s bullish bias.I mention the first possibility because Asness found some statistical support for the interest-rate-adjusted P/E over the 20-year period between 1982 and 2001. It might therefore be that some believers in the adjusted P/E genuinely believed they had history on their side, even though they were focusing on only a small and unrepresentative subset of the full record.My hunch, however, is that Wall Street’s bullish bias is the bigger reason why so many think an interest-rate-adjusted P/E is superior to the unadjusted. The adjusted version does have some superficial plausibility, and that’s all Wall Street needed to tell a story for why we should buy into a market that is otherwise increasingly overvalued.The real test will come when interest rates begin to rise, as most economists and investors expect in coming years. If this bullish bias is really what’s going on, then Wall Street will be quick to jettison the interest-rate-adjusted P/E and look for alternate “stories” to tell for why we should invest in stocks.Click here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Sentiment Indexes.More from MarketWatch:Fund managers are most bullish on stocks since early 2011Warren presses Yellen to get tougher on big banksThe best way to loan your child money to buy a home	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=56373F94-0C2F-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Right and left finally agree: Obama has checked out	By Darrell Delamaide, MarketWatchIt’s one thing if hardened critics like Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly asks whether the Obama presidency is “imploding,” as she did last month , citing a string of foreign policy debacles and domestic scandals.Or if Republican lobbyist Ed Rogers says Obama “seems to have taken something like an early retirement,” as he did in his Washington Post blog earlier this month, finding that the president’s recent speeches reveal “a state of mind that suggests he has checked out.”It is another, however, if the chief U.S. commentator for the Financial Times, Edward Luce, takes Obama to task, as he did this week, in an op-ed titled “Farewell to trust: Obama’s Germany syndrome.”Luce takes the flap over the CIA spying on an ally like Germany as symptomatic of an administration that has lost the trust of the public both at home and abroad.The British journalist notes that Obama dismisses such charges as cynical, but Luce rejects that label for himself and other critics in the press.“Most reporters are better described as skeptical,” Luce says. “A cynic believes there is nothing new under the sun. A skeptic resists gullibility. On the basis of the latter, Mr. Obama does not appear to relish being chief executive.”Kelly dismissively refers to Obama’s response to crisis as “smiling, golfing and at this very moment partying,” but Luce, too, notes that Obama has played golf 179 times while in office, much more than avowed golf lover George W. Bush, and headlined 393 fundraisers, more than double his predecessor’s total.“If Mr. Obama put half as much effort into co-opting or wrong-footing his opponents as he does raising cash from the wealthy, people might be less skeptical,” Luce writes.Veteran journalist Patrick Smith, who has written for liberal publications like The Nation and the New Yorker, also takes Obama to task for the German spy scandal and the insufficient response by American officials.“I can think of two names for this,” Smith wrote this week in Fiscal Times. “One is ‘outmoded arrogance.’ The other is ‘asleep at the wheel.’ Whatever the moniker, some measure of incompetence lies behind it.”When MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski interviewed Obama last month on the subject of Iraq, network commentator Donny Deutsch, an avowed Democrat, said, “I’ve never seen a less-engaged look in his eyes.”Deutsch added: “He almost seemed — I don’t want to say checked-out because that is not the right thing — but watching him, his cadence was different. He feels like he almost wants to go home at this point.”Another commentator on that program, Mark Halperin, said that Obama’s answers on the Syrian situation were nuanced and accurate, but people expect more from a president than great analysis of problems.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=842A1560-0C53-11E4-911A-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Treasurys Lew says show economic patriotism, end inversions: live blog	CNBC’s Delivering Alpha hedge fund conference is under way in New York. We’ll be hearing from a number of industry heavyweights, including John Paulson, Leon Cooperman and Carl Icahn. MarketWatch’s Sital Patel and William Watts are live blogging the event here.Griffin is asked to defend “payment for order flow” and other nuances of high-frequency trading.Payment for order flow has a long history and has replaced a number of reciprocal arrangements that used to exist. The market, like much of the economy, has separated into areas of “excellence.”Griffin says there are more synergies in media. The question is, which assets can be bought given so many are controlled by a small number of shareholders.Next up, the usually media-shy Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel.He’s asked about the reported run by 21st Century Fox at Time Warner Cable, which the cable firm reportedly rebuffed.Griffin, a shareholder of both, says he thinks “we’ll get to yes.”Where do panelists see a substantially stretched market?Lee says biotech, social mediaErdos says Euro is over-valued, we are not in a credit bubble if we grow into it.Marshall says he doesn’t understand valuations for social media like WhatsApp. “Wherever you see disruption models” are where there are investing opportunities”Like retail and banks right now.Jane likes China and says does have some opportunities. Aviod China internet firms.  Jane says volatility across the board, we have cheaply priced valuations.Emerging markets overall are trading at least 40% cheaper.Paul Marshall says Mexico looks interesting, long-short emerginng markets.But China is a massive value trap.Erdoes says credit card spending is up, delinquencies are down the U.S. economy is looking fine, we have all sorts of great conditions out there.Jane Mendillo says U.S. economy has improved very well, unemployment levels are lower, the Fed has to tread a very thin line.“Time to take the training wheels off,” says MendilloUnemployment levels are down to historic levels where the Fed would be talking about raising rates. We have this very dovish policy, predicated Janet Yellen.The risk is that the Fed is percieved to be behind the market, says Paul Marshall.Marshall says he doesn’t think we are in a bubble yet but world market capitalization has increased by $20 trillion in the last few years.We have to make that adjustment, this is unprecedented.Paul Marshall says Janet Yellen should stick to her daily job, when asked about her comments yesterday.Evans asks panel if Mary Callahian Eros should be the next CEO of JPMorgans..Crowd laughs.Jane Mendillo answers by saying, yes she coud be.This after CEO Jamie Dimon talked about succession plans at the firm, in light of his diagnosis of throat cancer. Panel talks about what the strategies are the best one.Eros: it’s about how you invest and not particularly about what indexes you invest in.Mary Callahan Eros says goal in asset management is to be the best not the biggest.“We deliver alpha everyday”Up next is the Global Stage panel with Kelly Evans.Panelists are Lee Ainslie of Maverick Capital, Mary Callahan Eros from JPMorgan, Paul Marshall of Marshall Wallace and Jane Mendillo of Harvard Management CompanyLaughter from the crowd as Lew refuses to answer questions about whether portions of the stock market are overvalued.Lew says he believes the carried interest provision, which allows hedge fund fees to be taxed as capital gains rather than regular income, is used inappropriately. Probably not a popular position with the crowd here.Ugh, the dreaded debt ceiling.Lew says he hopes everyone “learned their lesson” from previous showdowns and its impact on the economy. “I hope we never go back to what we saw last October” when the debt-ceiling threat raised the specter of default, he says.Lew says a top  U.S. corporate tax rate in the 20s percentage wise would help spur normalization of tax rates around the world. While the U.S. has a high marginal corporate tax rate, a slew of loopholes makes the effective rate more toward the world norm.Tax inversions are something that can’t be addressed by administrative action, Lew says.Moving away from cybersecurity, what about inversions?Lew says he’s calling for companies to show some “economic patriotism” and emphasizes a call for “comprehensive business tax reform.” If that can’t be done quickly, something else needs to be done to shut the door on inversions.Lew says he expects to see more activity where false information is put out via social media. There needs to be an end to the taboo against disclosing breaches.Lew ends prepared remarks and sits down for a Q&A with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, who asks the Treasury secretary whether he used his cell phone while in China.Lew says he did, but that he’s always cautious when he does so.Lew says cyber security must be the responsibility of “management at all levels.”Many firms are reluctant to report cyber security breaches out of fear of damage to their reputations, but this has to stop, Lew says. He also calls on Congress to pass tougher cyber security legislation.Firms need to be aware not only of counterparties’ financial risk, but also their cyber security risk, Lew says.There have been more than 250 distributed denial of service attacks against U.S. financial institutions since 2011, Lew says. So far, they’ve made life inconvenient for banks and their customers, but the risk of a “catastrophic” attack can’t be ignored.We’re under way and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is focusing on the threat of “cyber intrusions.”The Tell is MarketWatch’s fast and engaging look at trends and themes in the day’s markets.

21st Century Fox offered to buy Time Warner, was rebuffed	By Amol SharmaTime Warner said in a statement that the offer was not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders, and that its strategic plan will create significantly more value for the company “and is superior to any proposal that Twenty-First Century Fox is in a position to offer.”Separately, 21st Century Fox /quotes/zigman/18008450/delayed/quotes/nls/foxa FOXA -2.47%   confirmed that it made an offer that Time Warner rejected. The company added that the two sides are not currently in any discussions.Time Warner /quotes/zigman/528906/delayed/quotes/nls/twx TWX +17.28%  said the offer was to swap each of its shares for 1.531 non-voting Fox shares and $32.42 in cash. According to people familiar with the matter, the offer valued Time Warner at $80 billion, or $85 per share.Any deal, if consummated, would reshape the media industry. Time Warner’s lucrative cable channels, including TNT, TBS and HBO, would be part of a portfolio with 21st Century Fox’s FX, Fox News and the Fox broadcast network. The companies also would have the dominant film and TV studio business if Warner Bros. and Twentieth Century Fox were under one roof.Shares of Time Warner jumped 15% in premarket trading to $83.10. Fox shares added 10 cents to $35.26.Fox has suggested that synergies of a combination could be worth more than a billion dollars, but it wanted to have discussions to fully ascertain value of those savings and Time Warner hasn’t been willing to talk, one of the people said. Fox proposed selling off CNN, the one Time Warner asset it felt regulators would balk at being combined with Fox, which already owns Fox News channel, a CNN competitor.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:There’s a big hole in the bull case for stocks10 worst states to live in if you lose your jobTattoo removal surges 440% in the last decade	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=6960DF04-0CEC-11E4-ADF3-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Ackman rebukes Allergan over response to Valeant bid	By David BenoitThe letter, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, says Allergan /quotes/zigman/217110/delayed/quotes/nls/agn AGN +0.09%   has violated its fiduciary duty by not negotiating over the $53 billion takeover offer from Valeant and Ackman’s firm, which Allergan has rebuffed. It blames Valeant’s /quotes/zigman/122461/delayed/quotes/nls/vrx VRX -0.0084%   current stock price on a “scorched earth, negative information campaign against Valeant.” It asks that Allergan directors “first apologize” and then negotiate.An Allergan spokeswoman didn’t immediately comment.The letter is the latest volley in a bitter battle between the two companies since late April, when Valeant and Ackman’s firm, Pershing Square Capital Management LP, unveiled their overture to the California-based Botox maker. Pershing Square built a position of about 9.7% of Allergan and has signed a pact with Valeant that would give it a fixed amount of Valeant stock if the deal happens.Ackman is attempting to call a special meeting of Allergan shareholders, where he would seek to remove six of Allergan’s nine directors, thereby opening the door for the now-hostile cash-and-stock offer to proceed.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:There’s a big hole in the bull case for stocks10 worst states to live in if you lose your jobAmerica’s biggest untapped market is hiding in plain sight	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=1F3EBAB4-0CEB-11E4-ADF3-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Industrial production rises slower-than-forecast 0.2% in June	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in June to take the second-quarter rise to an annual rate of 5.5%, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a 0.3% rise, and there was a mix of upward and downward revisions going all the way back to February. Manufacturing output rose 0.1%, mining output climbed 0.8% while utilities output dropped 0.3%. Capacity utilization stayed at 79.1%, a touch below the 79.2% consensus.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C13D26BF-AC43-4A38-925A-FDA3798CEC96&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Time Warner confirms rejected unsolicited bid from 21st Century Fox	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Time Warner Inc. /quotes/zigman/528906/delayed/quotes/nls/twx TWX +17.34% on Wednesday confirmed that it has rejected an unsolicited bid from 21st Century Fox /quotes/zigman/18008450/delayed/quotes/nls/foxa FOXA -2.39% to acquire all of its shares for 1.531 Fox shares and $32.42 in cash. In a statement, Time Warner said there is significant risk and uncertainty surrounding the valuation of Foxs non-voting stock and the companys ability to manage a combination of such scale and size. There are considerable strategic, operational, and regulatory risks to executing a combination with Twenty-First Century Fox, the company said in a statement. The Time Warner board is confident the company can offer greater value to shareholders by sticking with its current strategic plan. Time Warner shares were trading up more than 15% on news of the bid, while Fox shares were slightly higher.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=88348B74-6EF1-4268-9BE9-D9A4808D780B&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Treasurys fall for a third day on pickup in wholesale prices	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe producer price index increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in June, according to Labor Department data. That’s higher than the 0.3% expected by MarketWatch-polled economists, marking a 1.9% rise over the past year. Core wholesale prices that exclude volatile categories edged up 0.2%.A pickup in inflation during recent readings has caused some investors to suggest that rising cost pressures may force the Federal Reserve to lift its near-zero policy rate target sooner than expected. Central bank leaders have clung to their low-rate policies, suggesting that the labor market hasn’t fully rebounded and inflation remains benign.Treasury prices, which had been slightly lower on the day, extended a fall. The benchmark 10-year note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR +0.39%  yield, which rises as prices fall, was up a basis point at 2.559%. The yield is set to rise for its third consecutive session.Market participants will return their focus to Washington, where Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is scheduled to complete her second day of Congressional hearings. She appears before the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. Eastern.Other data on the docket Wednesday includes industrial productions at 9:15 a.m., followed by a housing market index at 10 a.m. See the full economic calendar.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR +0.12%  yield rose a basis point to 3.374%, and the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR +1.06%  yield climbed 1.5 basis points to 1.706%.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Hulbert: There’s a big hole in the bull case for stocksDerek Jeter’s Yankees aren’t even New York’s most popular teamAmerica’s biggest untapped market is hiding in plain sight	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=93BB974A-0CE6-11E4-98A7-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Wholesale prices in June turn higher again	By Jeffry Bartash, MarketWatchThe producer price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in June after a surprise 0.2% decline in May, the Labor Department said . Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had predicted a 0.3% increase in the PPI.Wholesale prices remain elevated compared to earlier in the year. The PPI has risen an unadjusted 1.9% in the past 12 months, compared to just 1.2% as recently as February. Still, that’s well within the range the Federal Reserve considers acceptable and inflationary pressure earlier in the production cycle appears to be tapering off.The price of goods advanced 0.5% in June, led by the biggest increase in gasoline since the fall of 2012.Wholesale drug prices also rose sharply, up 1.4%.Yet the cost of food fell 0.2%, mostly because of lower grain and cheese prices.The cost of providing services, such as brokerage advice or catering, moved up 0.3% last month.Excluding the volatile categories of food, energy and trade, “core” wholesale prices rose a smaller 0.2% in June.Personal consumption, an index designed to foreshadow changes in the consumer price index, rose 0.5% in June. The personal consumption index is up 2.2% in the past year.The true cost to Americans is better seen through the consumer price index, which measures what people actually pay since wholesale price changes are not always passed on to customers. The consumer price index for June will be released early next week.Also read: Decoding Yellen: Sooner rate hike means March at the earliestU.S. risks fiscal crisis from rising debt: CBO	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=82331964-0CDF-11E4-ADF3-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

HCA shares rise 4.8% as company raises outlook	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- HCA Holdings Inc. shares /quotes/zigman/1545475/delayed/quotes/nls/hca HCA +7.55% surged almost 5% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the company raised its earnings guidance for the second quarter and full year. Results for the second quarter of 2014 exceeded our internal expectations, both in terms of our core operations and healthcare reform, said CEO R. Milton Johnson in a statement.

Live blog and video of Janet Yellen appearance before the House	Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will go before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday to discuss the central bank’s semi-annual monetary policy report. While Yellen’s testimony is no longer a secret, she will be grilled by as many as 61 members of Congress.

Rep. Scott Garrett, a Republican from New Jersey, seemed troubled by that answer. “A rule is useful input, but I just won’t go further than that,” Yellen said.Yellen said the Fed doesn’t have a target for equity values. The central bank instead  looks to see if valuations are outside historical norms.“In that sense, I am not seeing alarming warning signals,” she said.“Threats to financial stability are at a moderate level,” Yellen said. There may be pockets of stretched valuations, but “not generally,” she added. Yellen tells Rep. Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York, that the Fed hasn’t laid out a specific timeline for the first rate hike. She will not be pinned down on this. Most Fed officials see lift-off in 2015 but there is no exact timing, she notes. “There is no clear date,” she concludes.Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Republican of Michigan, who wrote the Fed reform bill, tells Yellen that, under the bill, the Fed can pick the rule to follow.Yellen replies there is no evidence that adopting a monetary policy rule is the best way to run a central bank.@EconomicsOne, right or wrong, would tell Yellen that a crisis is EXACTLY when you need rule based policy rather than discretion.— Dan Greenhaus (@DanBTIG) July 16, 2014Yellen defends the Fed’s openness, saying the U.S. central bank is the most transparent central bank in the world.Yellen says mathematical rules are best used as guides for policymakers. Yellen is pretty blunt about her opposition to the House Republican bill, saying it would be a “grave mistake” for Fed to commit to follow a mathematical rule.Rep. Hensarling is pressing Yellen about her weekly lunches with Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. He wants the Fed to disclose more about these closed-door  talks. Yellen is resisting.Q&A is starting.

Now Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California, and the ranking minority member of the panel, returns the fire, blaming Republicans for the slow recovery.Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a Republican from Texas, and the chairman of the House Financial Services panel, is making a strong opening statement in favor of a Republican bill that would require the Fed to follow a mathematical rule from when to raise or lower interest rates.Whilst the statement may be similar, Yellen will face seperate questions and thus we could see her drop a market moving comment #Fed— Joshua Mahony (@Joshua_AlpariUK) July 16, 2014We’re underway.Yellen’s testimony is expected to be nearly identical to the prepared remarks she gave Tuesday to the Senate Banking committee. Later on Wednesday, we have a speech from Richard Fisher, the president of the Dallas Fed, and the central bank’s Beige Book report on current economic conditions.The last time Yellen delivered her monetary policy report to the House panel in February, the hearing lasted until 4 p.m.The new Fed Chairwoman had promised to stay until all members of the committee who were present had a chance to ask her questions.The Fed also caused a stir in a discussion of asset prices in its monetary policy report to Congress.

Intel rises, Yahoo falls after earnings results	By Rex Crum, MarketWatchIntel /quotes/zigman/20392/delayed/quotes/nls/intc INTC +6.75%  climbed more than 6% to reach a 52-week-high of $33.95 a share after the semiconductor giant reported better-than-expected second-quarter results and offered an upbeat third-quarter forecast. Late Tuesday, Intel said it earned 55 cents a share, on $13.8 billion, up from 39 cents a share, on $12.8 billion a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast Intel to earn 52 cents a share on $13.7 billion in sales.The world’s largest chip maker said its results were helped by gains in PCs and data-center-related sales.Other chip stocks followed Intel’s lead, with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. /quotes/zigman/216580/delayed/quotes/nls/amd AMD +2.49% , Micron Technology Inc. /quotes/zigman/75433/delayed/quotes/nls/mu MU +1.00%  and Texas Instruments Inc. /quotes/zigman/7971332/delayed/quotes/nls/txn TXN +0.66%  on the rise.SanDisk Corp. /quotes/zigman/54370/delayed/quotes/nls/sndk SNDK +0.70% , which reports quarterly results after Wednesday’s market close, rose by 1% to $106.51 a share. The gains from semiconductor stocks and others helped lift the Nasdaq Composite Index /quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime COMP +0.18%  almost 19 points to 4,434, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index /quotes/zigman/1468249/delayed SOX +0.68%  also rose almost 1%.But Yahoo /quotes/zigman/59898/delayed/quotes/nls/yhoo YHOO -4.83%  failed to rally due to broad disappointment with the Internet company’s latest results.Late Tuesday, Yahoo reported a decline in earnings and total revenue from a year ago, as display ads, a key measure of the company’s health, also fell.

Why Colombia makes a nice alternative to Brazil	By Peter KohliIm approaching the picks based on specific sectors which I think will do well on their own, namely consumer goods, finance and infrastructure.Colombia has gone through its political and economic turnaround, and it now offers a very good macroeconomic story. For me, its a particularly auspicious sign that the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, won re-election, thereby giving foreign investors more comfort and the country more stability, to say nothing of the fact that he, unlike his opponent, is committed to ending 50 years of rebel conflict in the country.Colombias economy grew 5.9% last year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Interest rates are 4.75%, and inflation is among the lowest in Latin American countries at 3.10%. The country holds an investment grade rating from all three top rating agencies, Moodys, Fitch and S&P.Colombia can boast a near doubling in foreign direct investment in the last year. Equity benchmarks saw jumps of at least 20% in the local currency.A strong middle class is emerging; According to the World Bank, the percentage of the population in the middle class has risen to 28% from 15% over the past 10 years.As millions work their way up the social and income ladder, they spend more on personal goods, require more access to credit and finance, and start to demand better and more reliable infrastructure from their governments. Colombia said some $12 billion will be invested in infrastructure projects this year, mostly roadwork.Of course, international companies like Unilever /quotes/zigman/202185/delayed/quotes/nls/un UN +0.80%  are well positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for consumer goods by Colombias growing middle class. The major domestic companies are mostly private, including Alpina Productos Alimenticios , which provides food and dairy products,and HACEB , which provides consumer appliances. Although publicly traded General Motors /quotes/zigman/1466682/delayed/quotes/nls/gm GM +0.11%  has a majority stake in its Colombian car manufacturer GM Colmotores , the subsidiary is not listed on an exchange.There are very few Colombian ADRs trading on the U.S. exchanges. However, there is Avianca Holdings /quotes/zigman/22086801/delayed/quotes/nls/avh AVH -0.84% , an airline, and BanColombia /quotes/zigman/214164/delayed/quotes/nls/cib CIB +0.68%  in the finance sector.Going the ETF route, there is the Global X FTSE Columbia 20 ETF /quotes/zigman/1494972/delayed/quotes/nls/gxg GXG +0.60% . Among the top holdings are BanColombia and holding company GrupoSura , as well as Almancenes Exito , a retail company that taps into the consumer sector. Although the latter company, technically, has an ADR /quotes/zigman/476405/delayed/quotes/nls/alaxl ALAXL 0.00% , it does not appear to trade. GXG also includes several companies that tap into the infrastructure sector including Cementos Argos and Inversiones Argos.Despite the promise in the other sectors, Colombia is undeniably a commodity export-driven economy, enjoying a huge surplus over the last four years. For those bullish on the sector, consider Ecopetrol /quotes/zigman/10263/delayed/quotes/nls/ec EC +1.77% , the largest and primary petroleum production operation in Colombia. Theres also Toronto-based Pacific Rubiales Energy /quotes/zigman/41596/delayed CA:PRE +3.32% , which runs Colombias biggest oil field.Unlike Chile, whose commodities are tied more directly to trade with China, Colombias major commodity trading partner is the U.S., followed by the E.U. Thus the health of its commodity sector depends on the growth of the U.S. and E.U., rather than expansion in China.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E80EB87D-5727-4CA4-8563-353D2B76C84A&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Oil gains after surprise inventories drop	By Claudia Assis, MarketWatch , Eric YepU.S. crude-oil inventories fell by 7.5 million barrels in the week ended July 11, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Analysts polled by Platts had expected a decline of 3 million barrels.The EIA also said that gasoline stockpiles rose by 200,000 barrels, and distillate inventories, which include heating oil, increased by 2.5 million barrels. The analysts surveyed by Platts had expected gasoline inventories to increase 1.2 million barrels, and distillates stocks to increase 2 million barrels.Light, sweet crude futures for August delivery /quotes/zigman/2196851/delayed CLQ4 +0.95%  rose $1.31, or 1.3%, to $101.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after ending Tuesday at their lowest price since early May.August Brent crude /quotes/zigman/2648929/delayed UK:LCOQ4 -0.09% , which trades on London’s ICE Futures exchange, advanced 16 cents to $106.19 a barrel. The August contract for Brent crude is set to expire Wednesday.Futures got a boost earlier Wednesday from positive macroeconomic data from China showing that the Chinese economy grew 7.5% in the second quarter. That beat forecasts of 7.4% growth and a 7.4% expansion in the first quarter. China is the world’s top importer of oil.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said in its weekly commodity manual that Brent faced selling pressure in the short term through the expiration of contracts in August. The physical market appears oversupplied for now as crude supplies rebound at a time of poor refining margins. The issue is further compounded by the reopening of Libyan ports, it said.“As a result, finding buyers willing to take delivery of Brent going into expiry may be difficult,” Morgan Stanley said.Nymex reformulated gasoline blendstock for August /quotes/zigman/6362154/delayed RBU4 -0.19%  -- the benchmark gasoline contract -- was flat at $2.90 a gallon, while August heating oil /quotes/zigman/9821456/delayed HOU4 -0.09%  was down less than a penny to $2.85.Home-builder confidence at 6-month highIndustrial production rises slower-than-forecast 0.2%America’s biggest untapped market is hiding in plain sight	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B4D51CF8-0CB4-11E4-98A7-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Fox’s bid for Time Warner means it’s time to buy Viacom	By Tomi KilgoreAlthough 21st Century Fox /quotes/zigman/18008450/delayed/quotes/nls/foxa FOXA -4.66%   said it wasn’t currently speaking to Time Warner, after the company rejected its $80 billion buyout bid, Tony Wible, analyst at Janney Capital Markets, said there should be more bids coming.“This is just the opening salvo,” he said.Wible is expecting more mega deals in the media sector, as content providers scramble to react to the consolidation among content distributors, such as AT&T’s /quotes/zigman/398198/delayed/quotes/nls/t T +0.65%  agreement to buy DirecTV /quotes/zigman/11635210/delayed/quotes/nls/dtv DTV +0.14%   for $49 billion, and Comcast’s /quotes/zigman/89307/delayed/quotes/nls/cmcsa CMCSA +0.35%   deal to buy Time Warner Cable /quotes/zigman/528868/delayed/quotes/nls/twc TWC +0.29%  for about $45.2 billion.So while there may be more room for Time Warner shares to rise, Wible said investors are better off looking elsewhere to take advantage of the merger frenzy in the sector. “Who might be next? Viacom,” Wible said. Keep in mind Wible had said in early June that Fox buying Time Warner would make a lot of sense.“It’s the ideal time” for content companies to merge, Wible said, because “if you’re not buying now, there’s going to be fewer [companies] to buy in the future.”The analyst believes CBS Corp. is in the market for a cable network, and he believes reuniting with Viacom would provide the company with the greatest benefit. The companies were one entity before separating in 2006, and Sumner Redstone is the executive chairman of both companies.Viacom’s Class B shares /quotes/zigman/7563825/delayed/quotes/nls/viab VIAB +4.36%   rallied 5% in early trade Wednesday. They have lagged the broader market so far this year, rising just 1.7% year to date versus a 7% gain in the S&P 500 index.Meanwhile, Time Warner shares /quotes/zigman/528906/delayed/quotes/nls/twx TWX +16.00%   were up 17%, to hit the highest level seen since August 2001.Other content providers that Wible sees as potential buyout candidates include Discovery Communications /quotes/zigman/112277/delayed/quotes/nls/disca DISCA +6.71%   and Scripps Networks Interactive /quotes/zigman/511428/delayed/quotes/nls/sni SNI +3.33%  . Their shares surged 5.6% and 2.9%, respectively, early Wednesday.More must reads from MarketWatch :There’s a big hole in the bull case for stocks9 reasons Apple’s stock price will keep risingRight and left finally agree: Obama has checked out	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=252F9FA8-0CE9-11E4-BFB2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

If God wants you to be rich why deal with the devil?	By Paul B. Farrell, MarketWatchBut for the rest of the world, capitalism’s a losing bargain with a devil: Why? A billion people live on less than two dollars a day. With global population exploding to 10 billion by 2050. Thomas Piketty warns inequality between the rich and the rest will get wider, more dangerous. Pope Francis warns “Inequality is the root of social ills,” fueling killings, wars, revolutions.For years we’ve been asking: Why does capitalism blindly drive the human brain down this self-destructive path, whether it’s money, global warming, gun sales or voting rights? Why more books and ministers filling arenas with the message, God Wants You to Be Rich? Why is Pope Francis warning that a new “worship of the ancient golden calf has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money and the dictatorship of an impersonal economy?” Why?There is someone who brilliantly explains why free-market capitalism is controlling our brains, sabotaging our world: Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel, author of bestseller “What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets, and Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?”For more than three decades Sandel’s been teaching us why capitalism is undermining human morality. And why we choose to deny it. Why do we bargain away our moral soul? His classes number over a thousand. You can even take his course online free . He summarized capitalism’s takeover of the human conscience in “What Isn’t for Sale?” in the Atlantic. Listen:“Without being fully aware of the shift, Americans have drifted from having a market economy to becoming a market society ... where almost everything is up for sale.” Capitalism is America’s new “way of life where market values seep into almost every sphere of life and sometimes crowd out or corrode important values, non-market values.” His course should be required for Wall Street insiders, corporate CEOs, and all 95 million Main Street investors.Here’s an overview: “The years leading up to the financial crisis of 2008 were a heady time of market faith and deregulation — an era of market triumphalism,” says Sandel. “The era began in the early 1980s, when Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher proclaimed their conviction that markets, not government, held the key to prosperity and freedom.”Then in the 1990s the “market-friendly liberalism of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair ... consolidated the faith that markets are the primary means for achieving the public good.” Yes, Ayn Rand’s “pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism” took over America’s brain, our soul, became the nation’s collective unconscious. For both the GOP and Dems.Today “almost everything can be bought and sold,” warns Sandel. “Markets, and market values, have come to govern our lives as never before.” Yet few are aware of this historic shift. “We did not arrive at this condition through any deliberate choice. It is almost as if it came upon us,” says Sandel.As a result, “market values were coming to play a greater and greater role in social life. Economics was becoming an imperial domain. Today, the logic of buying and selling no longer applies to material goods alone. It increasingly governs the whole of life.” Everything has a price.Examples everywhere: “For-profit schools, hospitals, prisons ... outsourcing war to private contractors ... police forces by private guards ... drug companies aggressive marketing of prescription drugs prohibited in most other countries.” Ads in “public schools ... buses ... corridors ... cafeterias ... naming rights to parks and civic spaces ... blurred boundaries within journalism, between news and advertising ... buying and selling the right to pollute ... campaign finance in the U.S. that comes close to permitting the buying and selling of elections.”But the 2008 crash ended our faith in conservative free-market capitalism: “The financial crisis did more than cast doubt on the ability of markets to allocate risk efficiently. It also prompted a widespread sense that markets have become detached from morals,” says Sandel. But so what? “Why worry that we are moving toward a society in which everything is up for sale?”Two big reasons concern Sandel, both echo the warnings of Pope Francis and Piketty: One is inequality: “Where everything is for sale, life is harder for those of modest means.” If wealth just bought things like yachts inequalities might not matter. “But as money comes to buy more and more, the distribution of income and wealth looms larger.” Second, corruption: “Putting a price on the good things in life can corrupt ... the meaning of citizenship.”	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=1B919502-0C4C-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Jim Cramer’s wrong — the Fed should talk valuations	By Steve Goldstein, MarketWatchJim Cramer — and he was, and is, hardly alone — and others thought this was inappropriate.“I disagree with the Federal Reserve’s decision to single out a couple of sectors where expectations are too great,” he said, to quote part of his mini rant .“Next time, Fed Chief Yellen, it might pay to point out that there are plenty of cheap stocks out there, too. At least that way you can help us make money, not just lose it.”Oh my goodness, can you believe this?First of all — help you make money? The Fed hasn’t helped you make money? Quantitative easing one, two and three haven’t helped you make money?Interest rates at zero for going on six years haven’t helped you make money?A discount rate of basically nothing hasn’t helped you make money?Making it easy for companies to borrow to buy back their stock hasn’t helped you make money?Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke explicitly said that one of the transmission mechanisms for QE to help the economy was precisely through the wealth effect engendered by stock market gains.But it’s not just that — ARE YOU KIDDING ME? — that yes, the Fed has helped stock-market investors make money.It’s also the Fed’s job to look at financial stability. The Dodd-Frank Act not only set up the Financial Stability Oversight Council, in which the Fed and other regulators monitor these issues specifically, but it expanded the central bank’s role in surveilling major banks and a handful of big firms in the financial sector, like American International Group.So, yes, the Fed should be keeping an eye on the stock market, as well as a host of other markets. It’s not remotely out of bounds for the central bank to discuss valuations, especially as it was asset prices gone awry (housing, and dot-com stocks) that caused the last two recessions, including, by the way, the worst one since the Great Depression. That would seem to be within the Fed’s mandate of price stability and maximum employment.No one’s expecting the Fed to initiate a price target on, say, Facebook, and by the way, they’re not going to. But it’s absolutely warranted and acceptable for the Fed to talk about the stock market and segments within it.For goodness sake, the Fed is debating ferociously over when to make the first interest rate hike — and even then, Janet Yellen goes out of her way to say rates will be lower for longer. Not only is she pledging to make conditions good for stocks, she also said the market as a whole wasn’t overvalued.By the way, Yellen has yet to talk about one of her powers — to raise margin requirements at broker/dealers.That would be one way for the central bank to calm asset prices in stocks without impacting borrowing costs for consumers and companies.Cramer, to his credit, says Yellen might want to consider such a move. But maybe the issue really is just a few sectors, and not the market as a whole. If Yellen is of that belief — and that is consistent with what she says, after all — then using her platform to talk down a few sectors is totally appropriate and less of a sledgehammer to the market as a whole.And it’s the best way for Yellen to help Cramer make more money.There’s a big hole in the bull case for stocksBank of America, DoJ discuss mortgage settlementAmerica’s biggest untapped market is hiding in plain sight	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=4254239A-0CEB-11E4-ADF3-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Home builders are optimistic for first time in six months	By Ruth Mantell, MarketWatchThe overall builder housing-market index rose four points to 53 in July, the National Association of Home Builders /Wells Fargo reported. Readings above 50 signal that builders, generally, are optimistic about sales trends. July’s result follows five months of pessimistic readings.Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a July reading of 50, compared with 49 in June.A strengthening labor market is perking up builders, said David Crowe, NAHB’s chief economist.“As employment increases and those with jobs feel more secure about their own economic situation, they are more likely to feel comfortable about buying a home,” Crowe said.Separate data show that employers are hiring more and announcing fewer layoffs, while workers are becoming increasingly confident . However, headwinds do remain for the housing market. Homes prices escalated over the past year, and some families have been priced out. In addition, it’s still tough for many borrowers to pass lenders’ strict standards and get a mortgage.On Thursday, the government will provide its latest monthly snapshot of new residential construction, and economists polled by MarketWatch expect housing starts to tick up to an annual rate of 1.02 million for June, compared with a 1 million pace for May . For context, economists say about 1.7 million starts are needed each year to maintain current stock and meet demand for replacement and second homes.Details of NAHB’s report show that its gauge of home builders’ views on upcoming sales of single-family homes rose six points to 64 in July, while a barometer of builders’ views on present sales rose four points to 57. A gauge of prospective-buyer traffic increased three points to 39.There’s a big hole in the bull case for stocks10 worst states to live if you lose your job	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F73041B4-0CEA-11E4-98A7-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Larger-than-expected inventories drop pushes oil higher	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- U.S. crude-oil inventories fell by 7.5 million barrels in the week ended July 11, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Analysts polled by Platts had expected a decline of 3 million barrels. Oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange added to gains after the report, with oil for August delivery up $1.19, or 1.2%, to $101.15 a barrel. The EIA also said that gasoline stockpiles rose by 200,000 barrels, and distillate inventories, which include heating oil, increased by 2.5 million barrels. The analysts surveyed by Platts had expected gasoline inventories to increase 1.2 million barrels, and distillates stocks to increase 2 million barrels.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=A1611949-1086-4D39-ABE0-DC6F3BD2951E&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Bank of America’s fixed-income revenue rises, bucking trend	By Saabira ChaudhuriExcluding adjustments to the value of the bank’s /quotes/zigman/190927/delayed/quotes/nls/bac BAC -2.05%  debt, FICC trading revenue was $2.4 billion in the second quarter, up 5% from the year earlier, driven by stronger performance from mortgage and municipal products. The increase was partially offset by declines in foreign exchange and commodities.On a call with reporters Wednesday morning, Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson said the comparison was helped by “weaker second-quarter levels last year.” He noted that trading volumes were a little depressed in the second quarter of 2013 as the Federal Reserve began talking about scaling back its bond buying program.The results come after Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported adjusted FICC revenue that slumped 12%, 15% and 8.6% respectively from the year earlier. All have been hampered for the past several quarters by a slow economic recovery, both at home and abroad, which dampened clients’ appetite for more complex, riskier trades.On Tuesday, J.P. Morgan and Goldman reported that some clients had turned more active in the quarter’s final weeks, helping the banks avoid a steeper drop. Both neither offered investors much comfort that the June pickup would continue.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.More must-reads from MarketWatch:There’s a big hole in the bull case for stocks9 reasons Apple stock will keep risingRight and left finally agree: Obama has checked out	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=032F9064-0CF5-11E4-ADF3-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Bank of America, DoJ discuss mortgage settlement	By Devlin Barrett and Christina RexrodeLawyers for Bank of America /quotes/zigman/190927/delayed/quotes/nls/bac BAC -2.09%   had requested the meeting, but it ended Tuesday with no progress made toward a final deal, people familiar with the discussions said.The bank is offering $13 billion, to be paid in both cash and consumer relief, but the Justice Department is asking for billions more, according to people familiar with the matter. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the bank was in talks to pay at least $12 billion.The bank announced Wednesday, in second-quarter earnings results, that it had set aside $4 billion in litigation expenses and said it was for “previously disclosed legacy mortgage-related matters”--likely a nod to both the AIG cases and the Justice Department negotiations.

Ivory Coast to offer bonds as hunt for yield rages on	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- The African nation of Ivory Coast was set to sell dollar-denominated sovereign debt on Wednesday, despite defaulting twice since 2000, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal . The country was planning to sell at least $500 million in 10-year bonds, which may yield around 5.875%. Ivory Coast is likely to benefit from a surge of investor money into riskier bonds as investors search for higher-yielding investments amid low interest rates. The Ivory Coast has been growing quickly, but has been challenged by two civil wars in the last decade. Other African countries may follow, with Senegal in talks to arrange a debt offering, according to The Financial Times . Kenya sold bonds last month to strong demand.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=F3E3E010-B4A4-438B-93E6-D391284B12D0&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Home-builder confidence highest in six months: NAHB	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Home builders turned optimistic this month, with a gauge of their confidence rising four points to 53 in July, hitting the highest level in six months, according to National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo data released Wednesday.

9 reasons Apple’s stock will keep rising	By Jeff Reeves, MarketWatchAs such, I make a habit of checking in on Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +1.06%  every three months or so. In December, I gave 10 reasons to buy Apple in this column; the stock is up 18% since then, double the S&P 500’s gain. After strong earnings in April, however, I warned there may be trouble on the horizon.And now that Apple has tacked on about 30% in three months, the stakes are raised. So is Apple stock gathering steam, set to jump amid the company’s earnings report Thursday? Or is this big run over the last few months too much, too quickly?While it may sound like a flip-flop after my take in April (or, maybe a flip-flop on April’s flip-flop from December?), I actually think Apple has more upside to come this year.Here are a host of reasons why, and what to look for when the company reports earnings Thursday after the stock market closes:Momentum: Let’s start here, because this is the name of the game for stocks like Apple. The shares are up 30% in the past three months, pushing above its 50-day moving average. The stock has surged 60% in the past year as the negativity that plagued Apple gave way to optimism. It’s reductive but true: Cult stocks like this go up because they’ve gone up.Enterprise: The tech giant has long had a stranglehold on a modest group of consumers who have jumped head first into the Apple ecosystem. A recently announced partnership with IBM /quotes/zigman/230066/delayed/quotes/nls/ibm IBM +2.10%  will deliver a suite of business apps, cloud services and even enlist IBM as a sales force for Apple gadgets. Between this move, the slow death of BlackBerry /quotes/zigman/19622165/delayed/quotes/nls/bbry BBRY -8.41% and untapped potential of the enterprise market, things are looking up for Apple as a supplier of business devices instead of just consumer gadgets. It will be crucial to watch enterprise performance metrics — Thursday’s report will provide clarity — but things are looking up.Emerging markets: Apple’s biggest money maker is the iPhone, which accounts for about half of the company’s revenue. And the iPhone’s biggest opportunity lies in China, where Apple products are popular. If you recall, a big reason for Apple’s surge a few months ago was the strength in iPhone sales, thanks to double-digit growth in China . It’s also worth noting that Mac sales have been red hot in emerging markets, growing at a double-digit pace as PC sales decline. This kind of broad brand appeal will serve Apple well in regions like China and Latin America in the years ahead.Profitable OS: Much is made about Google /quotes/zigman/30194416/delayed/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.05%  and Android’s market share of about 80% of global smartphone shipments. However, market share doesn’t equal profit share. Despite Google’s dominance, Apple raked in $10 billion in App Store sales last year, more than about $1.3 billion for Google Play. That’s a huge margin. Furthermore, Adobe /quotes/zigman/67665/delayed/quotes/nls/adbe ADBE +0.21%  broke down recent Christmas e-commerce trends a few months ago, and Apple was the runaway winner among mobile shoppers. According to Adobe, “iOS-based devices drove more than $543 million in online sales, with iPad taking a 77% share. Android-based devices were responsible for $148 million in online sales, a 4.9% share of mobile-driven online sales.” Say what you want about scale, but Apple clearly knows how to get people to spend money on its devices, meaning simply comparing device shipments grossly underestimates Apple’s potential.Cash king: Apple boasted $53.6 billion in operating cash flow last year, and counts over $150 billion in cash and investments. When it comes to a balance sheet, Apple has perhaps the widest moat of any company on Wall Street. Of course, the cash stockpile as of March was actually down from the beginning of the year, so it will be informative to get an update.Deal potential: Apple recorded its biggest deal this year with the purchase of Beats for $3 billion. That shows Apple isn’t afraid to spend in the Tim Cook era, even if his predecessor, Steve Jobs, was averse to buyouts and external talent. The Beats deal may not transform the business, but considering the company moved $1.5 billion in sales last year, it seems very likely to pay for itself via high-end accessory sales packed with Apple’s gadget power. These kinds of deals are necessary for a company of Apple’s size to keep growing.Buybacks: That big cash stockpile didn’t shrink much on the Beats deal. That’s because the price tag is dwarfed by the $90 billion allocated to share buybacks as of a few months ago. Sure, that’s way above cash flow and a big chunk of the outstanding cash, but at current pricing, that will suck up almost 16% of Apple stock outstanding. That’s a huge boost to shareholders as it will fuel earnings per share growth. The buybacks could even provide a tailwind in Thursday’s report.Dividends: While we are on the topic of delivering cash to shareholders, Apple last quarter increased its dividend to 47 cents per share (split adjusted). That increases the yield to a modest 2% on current pricing. However, dividends are still a mere 30% of projected profits for fiscal 2014. That means Apple can continue to increase its dividend even if future profits don’t grow — which they surely will — and without dipping into that copious cash stockpile.Rotation to quality: One of the big stories in 2014 has been the flight from risky momentum stocks, be they 3D printers or biotechs or fashionable IPOs that have flamed out. Apple is a real company, with real profits, and investors have been seeking out this kind of investment lately over riskier alternatives. The rally among old tech stocks has been conspicuous this year, with some of the market leaders being semiconductor plays like Micron Technology /quotes/zigman/75433/delayed/quotes/nls/mu MU +1.06% and Intel /quotes/zigman/20392/delayed/quotes/nls/intc INTC +6.78% . If you’re looking for tech exposure, you could do worse than a mega-cap tech company like Apple. Sure, innovation remains a challenge and that buzzword “disruption” gives some the heebie-jeebies. But most investors would take an entrenched smartphone giant like Apple over a cash-bleeding cloud IPO seven days a week.More from MarketWatch:There’s a big hole in the bull case for stocksAmerica’s biggest untapped market is hiding in plain sightObama urges immediate action on ‘inversions’	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=48933F24-0CE7-11E4-BFB2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Tesla looking at California for battery factory: report	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Tesla Motors Inc. /quotes/zigman/118681/delayed/quotes/nls/tsla TSLA -0.21% is taking a closer look at California as the place to build its battery factory after state lawmakers proposed new tax breaks and regulation changes that would speed construction and lower costs, The Wall Street Journal reported. California had been considered a distant fifth state vying for the factory, which would cost about $5 billion to build and employ more than 6,000 people. Tesla makes its cars in Fremont, in the San Francisco Bay Area, and its headquarters is in Palo Alto. California has set into play various legislative proposals and actions that have enabled it to come back into consideration, the newspaper quoted Tesla spokesman Simon Sproule as saying.

Recap of live blog of Janet Yellens appearance before the House	Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen spoke to the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday to deliver  the central bank’s semi-annual monetary policy report. While Yellen’s testimony is no longer a secret, she will be grilled by as many as 61 members of Congress. Greg Robb live-blogged the proceedings.spyYour browser does not support iframes.10_yearYour browser does not support iframes.Also read: Day One: Yellen says Fed could move soonerDecoding Yellen’s commentWarren presses Yellen on living willsWelcome to the second day of Yellen’s report to Congress on monetary policy. Yesterday, Yellen that if the labor market keeps surprising the central bank, then rate hikes might come sooner and faster. She stressed that that time has not yet arrived. The Fed also caused a stir in a discussion of asset prices in its monetary policy report to Congress. The report noted that stock market valuations for small firms, social media, and biotechnology firms “appear to be stretched.”The last time Yellen delivered her monetary policy report to the House panel in February, the hearing lasted until 4 p.m.The new Fed Chairwoman had promised to stay until all members of the committee who were present had a chance to ask her questions.Later on Wednesday, we have a speech from Richard Fisher, the president of the Dallas Fed, and the central bank’s Beige Book report on current economic conditions.Yellen’s testimony is expected to be nearly identical to the prepared remarks she gave Tuesday to the Senate Banking committee. We’re underway.Whilst the statement may be similar, Yellen will face seperate questions and thus we could see her drop a market moving comment #Fed— Joshua Mahony (@Joshua_AlpariUK) July 16, 2014Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a Republican from Texas, and the chairman of the House Financial Services panel, is making a strong opening statement in favor of a Republican bill that would require the Fed to follow a mathematical rule from when to raise or lower interest rates.Partisan sniping has already started.Hensarling criticizes Democrats for reacting hysterically to his bill to reform the Fed. Now Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California, and the ranking minority member of the panel, returns the fire, blaming Republicans for the slow recovery.Here is a link to details about the House Republican plan to reform the Fed. Hensarling announces that the hearing will end at 1 p.m. Eastern, so it won’t be a marathon.Yellen has begun to read her statement. Takes a few minutes. Quick market update: S&P 500 Index + 0.3%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.5%Crude is up $0.77 to $100.74.Gold is up $5 to $1,302 an ounce.Yellen is very close to wrapping up her prepared remarks. One more page!Q&A is starting. First question, the House Republican reform bill.Rep. Hensarling is pressing Yellen about her weekly lunches with Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. He wants the Fed to disclose more about these closed-door  talks. Yellen is resisting.Yellen is pretty blunt about her opposition to the House Republican bill, saying it would be a “grave mistake” for Fed to commit to follow a mathematical rule.Yellen defends the Fed’s openness, saying the U.S. central bank is the most transparent central bank in the world.Yellen says mathematical rules are best used as guides for policymakers. @EconomicsOne, right or wrong, would tell Yellen that a crisis is EXACTLY when you need rule based policy rather than discretion.— Dan Greenhaus (@DanBTIG) July 16, 2014Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Republican of Michigan, who wrote the Fed reform bill, tells Yellen that, under the bill, the Fed can pick the rule to follow.Yellen replies there is no evidence that adopting a monetary policy rule is the best way to run a central bank.Yellen tells Rep. Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York, that the Fed hasn’t laid out a specific timeline for the first rate hike. She will not be pinned down on this. Most Fed officials see lift-off in 2015 but there is no exact timing, she notes. “There is no clear date,” she concludes.“Threats to financial stability are at a moderate level,” Yellen said. There may be pockets of stretched valuations, but “not generally,” she added. Yellen said the Fed doesn’t have a target for equity values. The central bank instead  looks to see if valuations are outside historical norms.“In that sense, I am not seeing alarming warning signals,” she said.“A rule is useful input, but I just won’t go further than that,” Yellen said. In another financial crisis, the Fed might decide to open its discount window to brokerage firms. Rep. Scott Garrett, a Republican from New Jersey, seemed troubled by that answer. #Yellen: We’ve just lived through a period when simplistic rules would have performed “miserably” & would have produced “dreadful” results.— John Dearie (@John_Dearie) July 16, 2014Yellen downplays risks to banking system from global hotspots such as Ukraine and the Middle East.“Direct financial implications for our banking system would not be large,” she said.Headwinds for the economy include low productivity, lack of credit, and households gloomy about their future income potential, Yellen said. However, most indicators of the economy suggest improvement, she notes.Yellen said that many Americans are hurt by structural factors in the labor market.

The Fed has a variety of tools it can use to raise interest rates. In the distant future, the Fed’s balance sheet will shrink in size, she adds.The slow recovery is the result of the financial crisis, Yellen said.What is her estimate of the existing output gap? Yellen says her “back-of-the-envelope” estimate is that the gap is a little over 2% of GDP. Yellen says she expected a rebound in housing by now.Why is it still lethargic?“I can’t give you a precise reason,” she replies. “I have to say I am somewhat surprised,” she added.  Credit is tight and some builders are facing supply constraints, she notes. Yellen has not had much impact on markets today.S&P 500 +0.4%Nasdaq Composite + 0.4%Our colleagues at The Tell are live-blogging CNBC’s Delivering Alpha hedge fund conference. Yellen is clear that the House Republican reform bill would increase short-term political pressure on the central bank.The hearing has ended.Capitol Report is a round-up of news and analysis provided by MarketWatch reporters, editors and commentators based in our Washington, D.C bureau and throughout the U.S.Follow us on Twitter: Follow @capitolreport !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js;fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,script,twitter-wjs);	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=31004424-C2D4-D574-5422-D1A0E8FA015D&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Feds Fisher calls for reinvestment taper in October	WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said ending asset purchases this fall isnt enough -- the Fed should should start to taper the reinvestment of maturing securities in October. Monetary policy is a bit like duck hunting. If you want to bag a mallard, you dont aim where the bird is at present, you aim ahead of its flight pattern. To me, the flight pattern of the economy is clearly toward increasing employment and inflation that will sooner than expected pierce through the tolerance level of 2%, he said in a speech at the University of Southern California. Minutes from the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed many want to wait until, or after, rates start increasing before ending reinvestment. Fisher meanwhile said rates should rise early next year, or potentially sooner, depending on the pace of economic improvement. Fisher, one of the most hawkish members, has a vote on the FOMC this year.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E8ECC69C-E7F7-4686-B4B7-26DACC6EAEB2&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
You may never have to buy another book again	By Quentin FottrellScreen grabs of a page testing Kindle Unlimited, which were cached here before being pulled down, offer “unlimited access” to over 600,000 titles — including “Life of Pi,” “The Hunger Games” and “Harry Potter” series — and thousands of audiobooks on any device for $9.99 a month. Amazon /quotes/zigman/63011/delayed/quotes/nls/amzn AMZN +0.52%   already has a “Kindle Owners Lending Library,” which permits Amazon Prime members to borrow one book a month (membership costs $99 a year).“Right now I would say Amazon is the biggest and best bet to become the Netflix of e-books,” says technology consultant Jeff Kagan. Amazon has a ready-made library of titles, and the infrastructure in place after two decades in the online retail industry, he says, but it can’t afford to get left behind as consumers move from downloading to streaming and renting. “The business model of the industry is changing. That creates enormous growth opportunities for current leaders in the e-book space — namely Amazon.com,” Kagan adds.Publishing experts say more companies are finding ways to allow readers to swap e-books, read them for a monthly subscription, or rent them from an e-library. Kindle owners who are also Amazon Prime members can already choose from over 300,000 books to borrow for free with no due dates, but they may only choose one book a month. Services such as eBookFling.com and Lendle.me give Kindle and Barnes and Noble’s Nook customers access to tens of thousands of other potential e-book lenders for a 14-day period.So far, however, there is no book-streaming or rental service with the scope and selection of Spotify for music, or Netflix for movies and television. “I’m skeptical that the economics of e-book subscriptions will be compelling enough for authors published by the big corporate houses to play along,” says Simon Lipskar, the president of Writers House, a literary agency in New York. “Subscriptions are fabulous models for the branded platform, fabulous for the heavy-use consumer — and usually quite wretched for the creators of the works.”Also see: The download is dead; long live the streamBut consumers want the same flexibility they have with music and movies. “We’re increasingly addicted to instant gratification,” says Evan Carroll, digital media analyst and co-author of “Your Digital Afterlife.” That, he says, is why people stream music with Spotify and Pandora, and movies through Netflix and Hulu. “I anticipate that we will see more e-book publishers take this approach in the near future,” he says. Peter Hildick-Smith, president of book market researcher Codex Group, agrees. “It’s the next logical step in the market’s evolution,” he says.There is a burgeoning market in e-book rentals. Safari Books Online — which has a website and apps on iOS and Android — has partnered with over 100 publishers to provide access to technology e-books on a subscription model; it has over 30,000 IT e-books. “Think of it as Netflix streaming for professional developers,” says Safari’s director of marketing Troy Petersen. Texas Southern University and California State rent text e-books at discounts of up to 60% off the print price through CourseSmart.com, a digital service that began in 2007 and partners with 100 universities and colleges.Startup Oyster Books charges $9.95 a month for unlimited reading, and offers more than 500,000 titles from over 1,600 publishers. “Oyster’s challenge will be to prove that they can make the model profitable for Oyster,” says Mark Coker, founder of e-book distributor Smashwords.com. Rival Scribd offers unlimited books for rent for $8.99, with 300,000 books from more than 900 publishers. Entitle offers two e-books a month for $9.99, including new releases and best sellers, such as “Hard Choices” by Hillary Clinton and “Mr. Mercedes” by Stephen King.It will be an uphill battle to get mainstream publishers and authors onboard, experts say. A successful e-book rental or subscription service will need to convince publishers that the service augments — rather than replaces — traditional e-book retailer sales, Coker says. It may make more sense to rent books, however, considering people tend to read them just once: “A song is a three- to four-minute customer experience, which is often repeated with the same song multiple times,” he says. “A book is a multi-hour experience, but is seldom read a second or third time.”If e-book rentals take off, they may only make financial sense for avid readers. “Paying $9.95 a month for the premium Spotify is probably more than I used to spend on purchasing songs or albums,” says Neil Schlager, founder of Schlager Group, a publisher of materials for students and teachers, “but I’m happy to do it because the service has value to me.” But e-books prices are still low compared with print copies, Coker says. Amazon charges $9.99 for new and best-selling e-books. “Any e-book subscription or rental service needs to meet or beat what retailers are already doing,” he says.(This story has been updated.)	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=0EA9DA46-CE47-11E2-A536-002128040CF6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Don’t short this dull market	By Lawrence G. McMillan, MarketWatchMany financial areas are displaying some of the lowest volatility in memory. Is this a danger sign or just part of a longer-term bullish trend? In some sense, it’s both.That is, it’s the latter (a longer-term bullish trend), until that trend is broken. Hence, selling now because volatility is low isnt a good idea. One would be better served to wait for volatility to begin to increase before jettisoning his positions.The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.42%  exhibited some intraday volatility of late (consider last Thursday’s sharply lower opening, followed by a day-long rally to recoup most of the losses; or consider yesterday’s higher opening, which turned into an 18-point drop in SPX after Fed Chairman Janet Yellen spoke). However, from a larger point of view, the 20-day historic volatility of SPX remains at extremely low levels. It is currently a mere 6.7%, and was recently as low as 5.5%. Those are very low levels, but they reflect what is happening (using closing prices).When volatility is low, stock prices are generally rising and can continue to rise for long periods. Witness the low volatility period that began in mid-2005 and essentially persisted through February of 2007. It is generally not a good time to sell, unless your timing is impeccable. Ever hear of the old saying, “Never short a dull market”? It’s an old saying for a reason — it’s generally true.Let’s review the indicators. the chart of SPX is in an uptrend, and during this phase of the bull market — which began in late 2011 — it has paid to heed this trend. While other indicators might have generated sell signals along the way, the trend of SPX hasnt faltered. There is short-term support near the 1,950 area, and it has been tested several times — most recently last Thursday. Below there, there is support at 1925 The mid-June lows, and then major support at 1,900 below that (the top of the trading range from March to May, 2014). In my opinion, a violation of the 1,925 support would break the bullish trend and would be quite negative. Even a violation of the 1,945 level might be enough to break the trend. But certainly, as long as SPX is above 1,950, the trend is bullish.Equity-only put-call ratios continue to remain on sell signals. In essence, both ratios are moving higher and, as long as that is the case, they will remain on sell signals. While we consider these to be important indicators, they are subservient to the major trends of SPX and VIX.Market breadth (advances minus declines) indicators have deteriorated since SPX last made new all-time highs, on July 3. As a result, both breadth oscillators that we follow generated sell signals. They remain on those sell signals currently. On recent days, breadth has been struggling to remain positive even when SPX is higher.Cumulative breadth is the running total of daily breadth. When SPX made those all-time highs on July 3, cumulative breadth also was making new all-time highs. This was true whether one calculated breadth using NYSE data or calculated it using “optionable stocks only” data. It’s a positive confirmation that cumulative breadth and SPX were making new all-time highs together. Often, one sign of a major top is that the indexes make new highs, but cumulative breadth lags behind. That hasnt been the case. Having said that, there is a possible divergence setting up. SPX is within a handful of points of a new all-time high today, but cumulative breadth has fallen back more than that. This may constitute a negative divergence, but it’s probably too soon to say that definitively.Meanwhile, volatility indexes (VXST) /quotes/zigman/2766221/delayed VIX -5.35% /quotes/zigman/2772139/delayed XX:VXV -3.19%  have remained subdued. As noted above, that is generally positive for stocks. If VIX is trendless or is trending lower, then stocks can rise quite easily. It is only when volatility begins to trend higher that a bearish signal arises for stocks. At this time, I continue to feel that as long as VIX is below 13, it is in a bullish state for stocks.As long as we’re talking about VIX, one more thing can be considered: many are citing the low levels of VIX as signs of complacency and as danger signs for the stock market. Yet, as we pointed out earlier, 20-day historical volatility of SPX is below 7. It is a general rule of thumb that one can compare VIX with 20-day historical volatility. If the latter is 7, where would these “VIX critics” have VIX trade? It’s already trading between 11 or 12, which is a huge premium to actual volatility. So, it isn’t true —again, in my opinion — that VIX is low because of complacency. It’s low because actual (realized, historical, statistical) volatility is low.Finally, the construct of the VIX futures is a good intermediate-term indicator. The futures are all trading at premiums to VIX, and the term structure continues to slope rather steeply upward. These are bullish signs, and so this construct is bullish — as it has been since late 2011.In summary, there are sell signals in put-call ratios and breadth, but the trends of SPX and VIX are still bullish. The latter two are very important, and so we will remain bullish for the intermediate-term as long as those two trends persist.Lawrence G. McMillan is president of McMillan Analysis Corp.

Pound rises to 22-month high against the euro	By Joseph Adinolfi, MarketWatchThe euro fell to 0.7897 pound sterling from £0.7917 late Tuesday.The dollar has continued to gain against the euro despite soft U.S. PPI and industrial production data, as remarks from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen Tuesday that interest rates would climb earlier and faster than expected if U.S. data on inflation and employment keep improving continue to offer support.The euro fell to $1.3529 from $1.3568 late Tuesday.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback’s strength against six currencies, rose to 80.5270 Wednesday from 80.3900 Tuesday.“If the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated by the (Fed) ... then increases in the federal-funds rate target likely would occur sooner and be more rapid than currently envisioned,” Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee. The Fed has held its benchmark short-term rate near zero since late 2008.The loonie rose to 93.05 cents from 92.96 cents, after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the central bank will maintain its overnight interest rate at 1%, as it seeks to curb a recent spike in inflation. The country’s total CPI inflation moved up to around 2% in recent months, nearly doubling from earlier in the year.Speculators have been buying the Canadian dollar because they believe that the rise in inflation in Canada will prompt the central bank to raise interest rates before the Fed does, said Michael Woolfolk, global markets strategist at BNY Mellon.The BOE could raise interest rates as early as the first quarter of 2015, Woolfolk said, while investors expect European interest rates to remain low for the foreseeable future.“Money that is held in Europe is rotating out of Europe and into England and the U.S. as investors search for higher yield,” Woolfolk said.Recap of Janet Yellen’s appearance before SenateDecoding Yellen: Sooner rate hike means March at the earliestChina GDP beats, but will there be more stimulus?	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CBA89E5C-0CAD-11E4-98A7-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Benchmark Treasurys swing higher after data, Yellen	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe benchmark 10-year note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR -0.51%  yield, which falls as prices rise, was down a basis point at 2.540%. The yield is set to snap a two-day rise.Data on Wednesday showed the producer-price index increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in June, according to Labor Department data. That’s higher than the 0.3% expected by MarketWatch-polled economists, marking a 1.9% rise over the past year. Core wholesale prices that exclude volatile categories edged up 0.2%.A pickup in inflation during recent readings has caused some investors to suggest that rising cost pressures may force the Federal Reserve to lift its near-zero policy rate target sooner than expected. Central bank leaders have clung to their low-rate policies, suggesting that the labor market hasn’t fully rebounded and inflation remains benign.Yellen on Wednesday held tight to previous remarks as she spoke before the House Financial Services Committee. Her statements on Tuesday in front of the Senate Banking Committee suggested the Fed could move to raise rates sooner if the labor market keeps surprising to the upside.Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said in a speech that the economy is moving toward its inflation and employment targets. He suggested slowing the reinvestment of its maturing bondholdings this fall, an action that more dovish policy members had wanted to put off.Data on Wednesday also showed that industrial production rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in June, missing expectations of a 0.3% rise. A gauge of home-builder confidence hit the highest level in six months.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR -0.65%  yield fell a basis point to 3.347%, and the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR +0.83%  yield climbed 1.5 basis points to 1.706%.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Hulbert: There’s a big hole in the bull case for stocksDerek Jeter’s Yankees aren’t even New York’s most popular teamAmerica’s biggest untapped market is hiding in plain sight	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=93BB974A-0CE6-11E4-98A7-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Gold edges up after three days of losses	By Shawn Langlois and Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatchGold for August delivery /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.16% /quotes/zigman/11829489/delayed GCQ4 +0.16% rose $2.70, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,299.80 an ounce. A day earlier, gold prices lost ground as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s dovish testimony sapped any chance for gains. This after the biggest drop of the year befell them to start the week.Walter de Wet, commodities strategist at Standard Bank, says gold seems a bit toppy, despite the fact that it has let off some steam in recent sessions.“While some of the new speculative longs in the market may be justified based on (largely unpredictable) political tension in e.g. the Middle East and Eastern Europe, we believe that these longs won’t stick because the fundamental drivers are lacking,” he said.On Wednesday, gold spent some time above the $1,300 level, but wasn’t able to hold there. In U.S. economic news, Yellen delivered a second day of testimony to lawmakers, and a reading on industrial production rose, albeit slightly less than expected.Elsewhere in metals trading, September silver /quotes/zigman/12294966/delayed SIU4 -0.50%  gave up 12 cents to finish at $20.77 an ounce. October platinum /quotes/zigman/19534176/delayed PLV4 -0.34% rose 70 cents to $1,485.70 an ounce, while September palladium /quotes/zigman/18010104/delayed PAU4 +0.37%  added $8.20, or 0.9%, to settle at $876.75 an ounce.

Why I prefer dividend-paying stocks like Wells Fargo	By Bill GundersonI much prefer dividend-paying stocks to fixed-income instruments such as CDs and bonds. I have a portfolio of 25 dividend-paying stocks designed for income-oriented investors. The yield on that portfolio is around 3.1%, which is higher than the CD rate and the 10-year Treasury rate. In addition to the income component of the portfolio, investors also have a chance to participate in capital appreciation.Now that can go both ways — the portfolio can also go down. But over the next few years, dividend-paying stocks should provide investors with better capital appreciation than fixed-income securities. The only way fixed income is going to appreciate considerably is if interest rates go down, and I do not see how rates can go much lower over the next five years. That is why I continue to prefer a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks as a fixed-income alternative.Looking at historical returns, the Treasury bond market /quotes/zigman/1480195/delayed/quotes/nls/tlt TLT +0.49%  has averaged 6.8% over the last five years, whereas the WisdomTree Trust LargeCap Dividend Fund /quotes/zigman/1496861/delayed/quotes/nls/dln DLN +0.51%  has averaged more than 20% over that same time period. As we look out over the future investment horizon, I think dividend-paying stocks are going to do even better over the next five years relative to the bond market than the prior five years. Declining interest rates have helped bond market returns over the last few years, but what about the next five?Another thing to remember about owning fixed-income securities is that you own debt. As an investor, you become a lender, not an owner. You are lending money to an institution, a government, a company, a municipality or a state. When you are a lender, you are subject to interest-rate and credit risk. While credit quality has improved over the last few years, the 10-year Treasury yield has climbed from 1.2% to 2.5%, and that has not been good for debt investors.Neither bonds nor dividend-paying stocks are riskless investments. Fixed-income investments are subject to interest-rate and credit risk. Dividend-paying stocks are subject to market risk. That is why I believe in an actively managed portfolio of stocks in order to help manage that risk.One name in my income portfolio of dividend-paying stocks is Wells Fargo /quotes/zigman/239557/delayed/quotes/nls/wfc WFC -0.56% .Best Stocks Now analysis..............Data from Best Stocks Now appWells Fargos market capitalization is $273 billion and ranks as one of the largest banks in the world.

Stocks may be outshined by Treasurys as Fed hikes rates	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchLike many market watchers, the CRT Capital Group interest-rate strategist has been trying to make sense of the unexpected rally in long-term Treasurys this year, which has helped hold down a wide range of consumer borrowing costs, from mortgage rates to student loans.But it was a series of unrelated articles in Barron’s that illuminated the current psychology of his own market, and led him to the conclusion — which he quickly penned in an 1,100 word note to clients — that Treasurys are poised to outperform riskier investments when the Federal Reserve finally jacks up its key lending rates.“The back end of the Treasury market likes the idea of Fed tightening,” Ader said by telephone, referring to his expectations of the relative performance of long-term U.S. government debt.The 10-year Treasury note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR -0.47%  yield fell by nearly 60 basis points to 2.44% in May from its peak at just over 3% at the end of last year, defying the expectations of most investors, but benefiting a small group who called it correctly. The benchmark note last yielded 2.54%.That’s pushed the Barclays 10-20 year Treasury index to returns of 7.7% so far this year, and the 20+year index up 12.8%. By comparison, a broad bond index has returned 3.7% and the S&P 500 stock market index /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.36%  has returned 8%, excluding dividends.Yet most on Wall Street are still calling for long-term yields to rise if improving economic data force the Fed to lift target fed funds rates earlier than expected. For lots of investors, the notion of a higher fed funds rate leads to the idea that benchmark yields must necessarily jump as well.Treasury investors aren’t the only ones watching for rate hikes. Across the markets there’s a pervasive sense of fear, which was highlighted in separate articles in the last issue of Barron’s (the publication is owned by the same parent company as MarketWatch). First, there’s the fact that junk-rated bonds have some of the lowest yields in recorded history. Then there’s exuberance in the equities market despite a muddling underlying economy. That’s peppered with fears that it can’t continue and talk of growing asset bubbles .“We don’t know when this will end, but rather think that the correction many worry [is coming] in stocks or credit or junk, given the more subdued nature of economic activity, seems about right,” Ader wrote.All of those asset classes have benefited as the Fed dropped rates to near zero and took unprecedented monetary-easing actions in the wake of the financial crisis. But the central bank is now winding down its stimulus and getting ready to hike rates amid a ho-hum economic recovery. In that context, what goes up must go down, Ader asserted.Investors in other markets are hunkering down for the reversal. Among other things, many mutual funds, from J.P. Morgan Asset Management to BlackRock , are holding more cash than they used to.“If and when the Fed does turn to a more hawkish bias, as much as we think it will hurt Treasurys, it will hurt other things more and so prove a steadying influence on our market at the sort of levels we’ve seen these last few months,” Ader writes.Benchmark yields may still rise when the Fed hikes, pushing down their prices. But that could pale in comparison to the underperformance in the risk markets, which have run-up further and faster than in the Treasury market, positioning them for a bigger fall. In that sense, U.S. government debt could be the “emergency exit” where the rest of the capital markets take cover.More from MarketWatch:Fox’s bid for Time Warner means it’s time to buy ViacomStanley Druckenmiller: Fed making very dangerous betSlim chances seen for tax ‘inversion’ clampdown, analysts say	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=9F7D3BD6-0CED-11E4-98A7-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Benchmark Treasurys rise after data, Fed	By Ben Eisen, MarketWatchThe benchmark 10-year note /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR -0.47%  yield, which falls as prices rise, was down a basis point at 2.541%. The yield is set to snap a two-day rise.Data on Wednesday showed the producer-price index increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in June, according to Labor Department data. That’s higher than the 0.3% expected by MarketWatch-polled economists, marking a 1.9% rise over the past year. Core wholesale prices that exclude volatile categories edged up 0.2%.A pickup in inflation during recent readings has caused some investors to suggest that rising cost pressures may force the Federal Reserve to lift its near-zero policy rate target sooner than expected. Central bank leaders have clung to their low-rate policies, suggesting that the labor market hasn’t fully rebounded and inflation remains benign.Yellen on Wednesday held tight to previous remarks as she spoke before the House Financial Services Committee. Her statements on Tuesday in front of the Senate Banking Committee suggested the Fed could move to raise rates sooner if the labor market keeps surprising to the upside, indicating that the central bank would continue to adjust its outlook as the economy shifts.“The flow of what she said is plain and simple: it ain’t an exact science. We’re all investors trying to boil it down to an exact science,” said Jim Sarni, managing principal at Payden & Rygel.Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said in a speech that the economy is moving toward its inflation and employment targets. He suggested slowing the reinvestment of its maturing bondholdings this fall, an action that more dovish policy members had wanted to put off.Data on Wednesday also showed that industrial production rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in June, missing expectations of a 0.3% rise. A gauge of home-builder confidence hit the highest level in six months.The Fed also released its Beige Book indicator of economic conditions, which suggested that the labor market is improving across the U.S.The 30-year bond /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR -0.48%  yield fell 1.5 basis points to 3.351%, and the 5-year note /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR +0.59%  yield climbed 1.5 basis points to 1.704%.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Hulbert: There’s a big hole in the bull case for stocksDerek Jeter’s Yankees aren’t even New York’s most popular teamAmerica’s biggest untapped market is hiding in plain sight	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=93BB974A-0CE6-11E4-98A7-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Apple and IBM: From ‘Think’ to ‘Think Different’ to ‘Think Again’	By Rex Crum, MarketWatchIn a nutshell, what IBM Corp. /quotes/zigman/230066/delayed/quotes/nls/ibm IBM +1.92% and Apple Inc. /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL +0.63% announced late Tuesday was a partnership to develop a new group of apps for businesses, and bring IBM’s so-called Big Data and analytics technologies to the iPhone and iPad. IBM will also sell Apple’s iPhones and iPads with those apps built in to customers around the world. And we’re not talking about just making an IBM program or two work better on the iPad. This deal involves more than 100 new apps built from scratch specifically for Apple’s iOS platform.If you’ve heard some rumbling underfoot, don’t be alarmed. It’s just Steve Jobs turning over in his grave.“Steve Jobs didn’t care about enterprise users, and the culture has taken time to change,” said Steve Milunovich of UBS.The reasoning behind Apple’s joining with IBM is simple: While it’s great selling devices that allow consumers to watch Netflix /quotes/zigman/87598/delayed/quotes/nls/nflx NFLX -1.06%  and play “Minecraft,” the company wants to expand the use of the iPhone and iPad into the business market. Chief Executive Tim Cook has said on several occasions that Apple needs to do more in the enterprise segment, and when Cook says Apple is going to do something he follows through.It’s not as if Jobs didn’t do the same when it came to running his vision through Apple; it just didn’t involve devoting large-scale time and resources to the needs of companies like IBM. But with Apple having what are arguably the most popular mobile devices on the market, yet also facing ongoing challenges from Google Inc.’s /quotes/zigman/93888/delayed/quotes/nls/googl GOOGL -0.07% Android devices, such as those from Samsung, the company needs to do more to expand its customer base, even if the immediate results are viewed as incremental. It’s as much a psychological approach as a practical one.“IBM is the gold standard in enterprise data and analytics solutions,” said Gene Munster, who covers Apple for Piper Jaffray. “[But] in terms of benefit to Apple, we do not expect the partnership to have a measurable impact.” Munster has estimated that Apple’s iOS products are already used by 98% of Fortune 500 companies.So why would Apple embark on a partnership that may not really do much for its bottom line?“Apple has a good share of mobile devices in the enterprise; now the issue is enabling greater use,” said Milunovich. “A big win for Apple is having IBM’s salesforce hawking iPhones and iPads and IBM service supporting the devices.”IBM is set to report its quarterly results Thursday, and Apple is slated to do the same on July 22. Both companies will certainly be questioned about their new partnership and their new way of thinking about and working with each other. Sam Palmisano is retired, and Steve Jobs is no longer with us, and Cook and IBM’s Ginni Rometty have set the stage to Think Again about what Apple and IBM mean to each other.Nine reasons Apple’s stock will keep risingnIntel’s CEO is upbeat after earnings, outlookYahoo’s Mayer has nothing to celebrate	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C47A0C3C-0CFE-11E4-BFB2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

GE in talks to sell household appliances business: Bloomberg	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- General Electric Co. /quotes/zigman/227468/delayed/quotes/nls/ge GE +1.53% is in talks to sell its household appliances business, which had more than $8 billion in sales last year, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. A sale could fetch between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion, the people said. GE made an unsuccessful attempt to dispose of the division in 2008 and only recently decided to try again after completing its $17 billion acquisition of Alstom SAs energy assets, the report said. The sale would be part of GEs strategy of divesting businesses in sectors in which it is neither a leading player nor set for growth.

Economy, labor market expanding across U.S.: Beige Book	By Greg Robb, MarketWatchThe Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes about the economy, said only two districts, Boston and Richmond, reported a slightly slower pace of growth since May.Tourism was one area of strength, expanding in all districts. Retail sales were said to grow modestly, led by car sales. Manufacturing was an other area of broad strength.Housing activity varied across the country, with reports of mixed demand.Stocks added to gains after the Beige Book was released. The Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/zigman/627449/realtime DJIA +0.35% was up 75 points to 17,135,Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen told Congress this week that she’s focused on labor market conditions. If job growth continues to exceed expectations, the Fed could hike rates sooner than expected, she noted.Yellen also is focusing on weak wage growth as a sign of slack in labor markets.The Beige Book said that, aside from higher wages to attract skilled workers, wage pressures remained modest.The Fed is also watching inflation, which has trended higher in recent months.The report found price pressures were “generally contained” with most of the 12 Fed districts reporting “slight to modest” price increases for both inputs and finished goods.Several districts reported higher prices for meat, dairy products, construction materials, and some metals.The Beige Book is based on information collected before July 7.

Pentagon starts space launch competition	By Doug CameronThe U.S. Air Force said Wednesday it had issued a request for proposals to launch an intelligence agency satellite in 2016, which is expected to pit the incumbent United Launch Alliance LLC against the space firm launched by entrepreneur Elon Musk.The contest comes earlier than expected and at a time when Mr. Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, has engaged in a fierce lobbying battle with ULA, pushing the Pentagon to open more space launches to competition.SpaceX has also sued ULA and the Pentagon to break up their multiyear exclusive contract for sensitive satellite launches that has given them a near monopoly on the military and intelligence market.Air Force leaders said earlier this year that a contest wasn’t planned until 2015.The Pentagon paved the way for competitive military launches in 2012 in the wake of sustained criticism from lawmakers over the cost of the ULA contract, which was extended last year. ULA has defended its record in reducing launch costs.The Air Force had planned to open an initial 14 launches to competition, but this year reduced that to seven or eight, citing planning changes and the better-than-expected durability of some existing satellites.SpaceX is expected to secure regulatory approval this year to launch smaller military payloads, and is developing a rocket for larger launches that would allow it to pursue all available Pentagon contracts.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=B1E7F0A8-0D11-11E4-BFB2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

Worm shortage means rising bait costs for fishermen	By Scott CalvertThe culprit is bad weather in Ontario, the Canadian province where nightcrawlers are handpicked in the wild and shipped south by the millions. First, the long winter delayed picking from March to May. Then a dry May kept the moisture-loving creatures burrowed deep underground.This spring’s dearth of Canadian nightcrawlers, the worst in 26 years, according to suppliers, has caused havoc with supply chains, affecting mom-and-pop bait shops and nationwide sellers. Some stores have raised prices, while others have held the line. At the same time, some bait shops say they have noticed little change in supply or price.DMF Bait Co., a major wholesaler in Waterford, Mich., had to pay its Canadian suppliers double the usual price, said Chief Executive Dan Beaudoin. Even so, the company couldn’t fill all its orders for the first time in its 37-year history. Though the crimp in supply has eased, he said his company is still paying 80% more than usual.DMF has raised prices on its customers, which include Wal-Mart Stores Inc. /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed/quotes/nls/wmt WMT +0.01% and other national chains, by about 20%.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=6E682612-0D21-11E4-BFB2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

What Fox’s Time Warner bid means for you	By Quentin Fottrell, MarketWatch21st Century Fox Inc.’s /quotes/zigman/18008450/delayed/quotes/nls/foxa FOXA -6.22%   bid for Time Warner Inc. /quotes/zigman/528906/delayed/quotes/nls/twx TWX +16.97%   valued the latter at $80 billion or $85 a share, according to reports . 21st Century Fox confirmed it made an offer, but said the two companies are not in talks. Time Warner said the bid involved swapping each of its shares for 1.531 nonvoting Fox shares and $32.42 in cash, but flagged “significant” uncertainty around the valuation of Fox’s non-voting stock. “There are considerable strategic, operational, and regulatory risks to executing a combination with Twenty-First Century Fox,” the company said in a statement. (In 2013, News Corp. /quotes/zigman/18008448/delayed/quotes/nls/nws NWS -0.17%  , which owns The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch, spun off Fox.)More movies, television shows and live sporting events being produced by one company means less competition and more seller power, says Samuel Craig, director of the Entertainment Media and Technology Program at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “Consumers may see a slight increase in their cable bill to see the content they want,” he says. As media reports of the bid have suggested, it’s unlikely that the Federal Communications Commission would allow one company to own both CNN and Fox News, he adds. “That would be an easy property for Rupert Murdoch to sell,” Craig adds. “It’s pretty dramatic how Fox News’s growth has outpaced that of CNN.”While most Americans still fork out for cable, fewer people are going to the movies. The number of tickets sold fell 1.5% to 1.34 billion in 2013, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Fox could bring some new perspective here, Craig says. “The opportunity here is to do a better job developing all the properties they have with DC Comics,” he says. “Fox may do a better job with the DC Comics.” Time Warner hasn’t had the same financial success with DC Comics that Disney has had with Marvel , according to data from BoxOfficeMojo.com. Disney has its own studio, Marvel Studios, devoted to the X-Men and Spider-Man franchises. DC Comics’s biggest superheroes include Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman.Also see: Whatever happened to the cable TV revolution?As consolidation continues, sports fans may also have fewer cable operators that show their live events, says Charles Warner, a media consultant and part-time professor at The New School for Public Engagement. “Live sports events are really important,” he says. Last May, FOX Sports won the U.S. English-language rights for the World Cup in Russia (2018) and Qatar (2022) beating offers from both ESPN and NBC. When people TIVO and DVR programs, they fast-forward through the advertisements, but that’s not possible if they want to watch a live sporting event. “Advertisers will pay more for live events,” Warner adds.Any deal would have to pass the Department of Justice’s antitrust review, which would depend heavily on how it defines each entertainment and news market, says Michael Hodel, equity strategist at Morningstar. “The FCC review is defined by the public interest,” he says. “All the FCC would have to do is conclude that the deal is not in the public interest to reject it.” That said, since the mid-1990s, “there’s been very little regulation over the scope of properties a media conglomerate can own in the U.S.,” says Aram Sinnreich, media professor at Rutgers University. The European Union takes a more hands-on approach to regulation of the amount of properties one media company may own, he adds.Media analysts are divided over the impact of such consolidation.“I would bet that most consumers don’t know that Comcast owns NBC,” says Dan Rayburn, a principal analyst with Frost & Sullivan. “And why should they? As long as good shows get made and they get to watch the shows they want, the average consumer could care less who owns that broadcast station.”But Patricia Aufderheide, communications professor at American University in Washington, D.C., disagrees: “Anyone who needs information to act in the world, which would be all of us, should be concerned about concentration of ownership and control.”And while some stiff antitrust hurdles remain, the biggest of all is that Time Warner rebuffed advances. But, Craig adds, “Rupert Murdoch is not one to give up.”See also:What you’ll save by ditching cable TV	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=24918752-0D19-11E4-BFB2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Ground offensive likelier in Gaza: Israel official	By Nicholas Casey and Joshua Mitnick“I think that every day that passes makes the possibility more evident, “ the official said during a briefing for reporters at Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv. His assessment, he said, was based on knowledge of Israeli cabinet deliberations.Despite Israel’s success in limiting the costs inflicted by rocket fire from Hamas and other Palestinian militant factions, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli authorities have repeatedly warned that they are prepared to escalate the war to end the rocket barrages, which have caused one death and disrupted daily life across the country.While underscoring the increasing impatience of Israel’s political and military establishment with Hamas and making plain that there were contingency plans for the re-occupation of the Gaza Strip, the senior military official said most Israeli policy makers still opposed any attempt to end Hamas rule in Gaza.A day after an Egyptian cease-fire plan crumbled after only six hours, the number of Palestinian dead in Gaza passed 200, as Israeli warplanes continued to target what it said were Palestinian militants and their infrastructure.The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said 209 Palestinians had been killed and 1,560 were injured since fighting escalated on July 7. Among the dead were at least 24 women and 39 children, it said.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=CA3ABE6E-0D1C-11E4-BFB2-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
John Paulson: Allergan cant continue alone	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Billionaire John Paulson of Paulson & Co. said Wednesday that Allergan Inc. /quotes/zigman/217110/delayed/quotes/nls/agn AGN +0.85% may be able to fight off Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.s /quotes/zigman/122461/delayed/quotes/nls/vrx VRX +1.89% bid for a bit but it may not be able to stand alone for an extended period. Paulson, speaking at the Delivering Alpha conference, also praised Valeant and said no other pharmaceutical company has done as much as Valeant to enhance shareholders value. The hedge fund manager plans to have a conference call with Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Thursday on his effort to unseat Allergans board. Valeant shares climbed 1.8% and Allergan shares rose 0.7%.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=11602A73-896C-4441-8988-A030E37A0078&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
Morgan Stanley earnings: Watch bond trading, wealth management	By MarketWatchEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet are expecting the bank to report earnings of 55 cents a share, up from 45 cents a share in the same period a year ago. Morgan Stanley /quotes/zigman/182639/delayed/quotes/nls/ms MS +1.56%  beat estimates in the first quarter with per-share earnings of 74 cents, or 68 cents excluding accounting adjustments.Revenue: The bank is expected to report revenue of $8.224 billion, down from $8.5 billion a year ago, according to FactSet. First-quarter revenue totaled $8.93 billion, a 10% increase from the year earlier.Stock performance: Morgan Stanley shares are up 3.5% in the year to date. That is less than the 5% gain by the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF /quotes/zigman/246222/delayed/quotes/nls/xlf XLF -0.17%  Key issues: Like its rivals, Morgan Stanley is expected to report a decline in revenue from trading in fixed income, currencies and commodities, given low volumes and volatility during the quarter. However, Morgan Stanley is generally regarded as better positioned than rivals such as Goldman Sachs in trading, as it accounts for less of its overall revenue and is generally weighted toward equities, which have far outperformed fixed income. In the first quarter, Morgan Stanley surprised investors with a rise in fixed-income trading, which bucked the trend in the broader industry.Citigroup Inc. /quotes/zigman/5065548/delayed/quotes/nls/c C +1.08%  , J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. /quotes/zigman/272085/delayed/quotes/nls/jpm JPM +0.76%   and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/188479/delayed/quotes/nls/gs GS +0.77%   reported FICC revenue fell 12%, 15% and 8.6% respectively in the second quarter from the year earlier. But Bank of America Corp. /quotes/zigman/190927/delayed/quotes/nls/bac BAC -1.90%  surprised investors on Wednesday with a 5% gain in FICC trading, which it said was driven by strength in mortgage and municipal products. A day earlier, J.P. Morgan and Goldman said they had seen a pickup in activity in the last few weeks of the quarter, which helped them avoid even steeper declines.Any weakness in trading will likely be offset by a stronger performance in investment banking, given the pickup in M&A activity and debt and equity issuance in the quarter, which should translate into higher fee income. Investors will also watch for an update on wealth management, a cornerstone of Chief Executive James Gorman’s strategy for boosting profit. Morgan Stanley expanded its wealth-management presence last year by buying out the remaining stake of a joint venture with Citigroup.“We continue to prefer Morgan Stanley over Goldman Sachs due to its asset gathering mix which accounts for 62% of 2015 estimated earnings and ongoing FICC restructuring,” analysts at J.P. Morgan Cazenove wrote in a recent note.More must reads from MarketWatch :9 reasons Apple’s stock will keep risingPlan to cut up California into six states moves toward voteRight and left finally agree: Obama has checked out	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=EFC4EC14-0D20-11E4-ADF3-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
21st Century Fox bond prices fall on Time Warner bid	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Bonds sold by 21st Century Fox /quotes/zigman/18008451/delayed/quotes/nls/fox FOX -4.64% fell in price Wednesday after the entertainment company said it pursued an $80 billion buyout of Time Warner Inc. /quotes/zigman/528906/delayed/quotes/nls/twx TWX +17.07% . While the offer was rejected, 21st Century Fox was said to be determined to acquire the company, which could increase the bidders leverage. 21st Century Fox bonds maturing in 2043 saw the premium yields offered over comparable Treasurys rise to 1.47 percentage points on Wednesday from 1.34 percentage points on Monday. Time Warner bonds maturing in 2044 saw their yield premiums rise by 1 basis point on the day to 1.46 percentage points, according to MarketAxess. Standard & Poors Ratings Services said its BBB+ rating on 21st Century Fox was unaffected by the bid for Time Warner.	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=C7614524-4F15-4911-A730-D96C485709B7&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16

U.S. stocks gain; Dow sets its 15th record of the year	By Anora Mahmudova and Barbara Kollmeyer, MarketWatchNEW YORK (MarketWatch) — The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record level on Wednesday for the 15th time this year, as better-than-expected corporate earnings and deal talk lifted broader markets.The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, which said that economic conditions and labor markets showed improvement across the country into early July, gave stocks a late lift.The S&P 500 /quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime SPX +0.42%  closed 8.29 points, or 0.4%, higher at 1,981.57.

Google earnings: Costs, ad pricing in focus	By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatchHere’s what else investors can expect:Earnings : Google /quotes/zigman/93888/delayed/quotes/nls/googl GOOGL -0.41% is expected to post a profit of $6.23 a share, compared with a net income of $4.78 a share in the year-earlier period, according to a consensus survey by FactSet.Revenue : The Mountain View, Calif.-based Internet company is expected to report revenue of $12.32 billion, up from $11.1 billion in the same period last year.Stock react : Google shares took a hit in April after the company reported a jump in expenses related mainly to its $3.2 billion acquisition of Nest Labs. But the stock has recovered since then, rallying about 5% in the last three months.Key areas to watch : Google’s expenses and profit margins could be in focus once again in its second-quarter report. Wall Street will also be paying attention to trends in ad pricing. The growth of Google’s mobile ad business has also meant lower ad prices, although that’s expected to stabilize with a more integrated system for digital ads.Still, Google is expected to report another quarter of strong growth, underscoring its position as a dominant player in online advertising.Despite worries about costs and margins, investors have also generally been supportive of Google’s bid to expand to new arenas, shown by the interest in Google Fiber and Google Glass, and its bid to expand its presence in e-commerce.On Monday, FBR Capital analyst initiated coverage on Google with an outperform rating and a price target of $674.In a note to clients, FBR Capital analyst William Bird said Google had “one of the widest moats in media and a good deal of optionality around extending its competitive advantage into display advertising, digital content, travel, and payments.”“Google offers very attractive exposure to each of the key structural growth areas of the Internet—namely, search, online video, mobile, and the app economy,” he wrote.Other must-read stories from MarketWatch:GoPro camera captures cop vs. cop skirmish in MiamiApple portrayed IBM as Orwellian ‘Big Brother’ 30 years ago	http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=E9791F60-0D07-11E4-98A7-00212803FAD6&siteid=yhoof2	2014-07-16
