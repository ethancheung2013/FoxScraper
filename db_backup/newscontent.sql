The University of Michigan issues its index of consumer sentiment for June, 2014 on Friday, June 27, 2014. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Strong job growth lifted U.S. consumer confidence this month, as Americans looked past the economys dismal first quarter performance.The University of Michigan says that its index of consumer sentiment rose slightly to 82.5 in June from 81.9 in May. That is still below Aprils reading of 84.1, which had been the highest in almost a year.ADVERTISEMENTThe reading suggests consumers shrugged off the economys first quarter contraction. Still, the survey was conducted before the government said the economy shrank much more than previously estimated, at an annual rate of 2.9 percent rather than 1 percent.And better confidence hasnt yet translated into more spending.Steady hiring is improving Americans finances, the survey found. Forty percent of respondents said their finances had improved in June, the most in seven years.	2014-06-27

Meanwhile, hiring rose in 36 states and declined in 14.ADVERTISEMENTThe biggest drops in unemployment rates occurred in Illinois, where the rate fell to 7.5 percent from 7.9 percent, and Massachusetts, where it fell to 5.6 percent from 6 percent. Georgia reported the largest increase, to 7.2 percent from 6.9 percent.Nationwide, employers added 217,000 jobs in May, the fourth straight month of gains above 200,000. Thats the first such stretch since 1999. The unemployment rate remained at 6.3 percent, matching a five-year low.	2014-06-20
432	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/06/25/economy-in-freefall-1q-revision-shows-shrinkage-2/	Economy in freefall? 1Q revision shows shrinkage of 2.9%	Americas economy shrank at a drastic 2.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter, a far more alarming picture than ones painted in two previous government estimates -- including one that actually claimed modest growth.The new figure released Wednesday by the Commerce Department is nearly three times lower than last months preliminary estimate of 1 percent shrinkage -- at the time the worst three-month performance since 2009 -- and far greater than the 0.1 percent growth estimate in April. The sluggish economys woes have been widely attributed to an unusually cold winter, but the latest figure -- the biggest difference between second and third estimates since 1976 -- could indicate far greater problems.ADVERTISEMENTWhile economists attributed those bad numbers to weather and other factors, the jarring number, dubbed "an absolute disaster" by Wall Street blog ZeroHedge.com -  is more difficult to dismiss. Fox New contributor and economist Peter Morici said there were several factors that can help explain away the lousy performance. But he said there are reasons for concern."Businesses scaled back their investment, and that is a bit foreboding," said Morici. "They just dont believe the presidents ballyhoo about this being a breakout year."The number will be revised once more next month, when the Commerce Departments Bureau of Economic Analysis makes historical revisions. But the negative 2.9 percent  figure is nearly three times lower than the  preliminary estimate of 1 percent released last month, and marks the worst performance for a three-month period since 2009. A still earlier initial estimate, in April, predicted growth of .1 percent for the quarter. The wide gap between estimates was problematic to many economists."That disparity really calls into question the accuracy of the measurement," noted Morici.The White House sought to downplay the precipitous drop, by looking ahead toward what it believes will be solid growth in the current quarter."First-quarter GDP was revised down today, largely reflecting a re-estimation of consumer spending on health care, which was substantially lower than originally reported, as well as exports, which were below the initial estimates," said Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, which counsels President Obama on the economy. "The GDP data can be volatile from quarter to quarter; a range of other data show a more positive picture for the first quarter, and more up-to-date indicators from April and May suggest that the economy is on track for a rebound in the second quarter."But Republicans blamed Obama policies for holding up the economy.“It’s clear the White House doesn’t know which way is up, just two months ago bragging that ObamaCare was helping the economy and now we’re seeing the worst economic report since the low point of the recession in 2009," said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. "The Republican House has sent Harry Reid and Democrats in the Senate dozens of bills to help jump-start our economy and it’s time they stop standing in the way.”The economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the final three months of 2013, and some economists are optimistic that the poor performance in January, February and March was a mere blip. Data such as employment, manufacturing and services sectors point to a sharp acceleration in growth early in the second quarter. Macroeconomic Advisers recently forecast the economy will grow at a 3.6 percent annual rate in the April to June period, according to The Wall Street Journal. Economists have previously estimated severe weather slashed as much as 1.5 percentage points from GDP growth in the first quarter, but even taking that into account would still leave a precipitous drop in performance.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 1 percent rate. It was previously reported to have advanced at a 3.1 percent pace. Exports declined at a 8.9 percent rate, instead of 6 percent pace, resulting in a trade deficit that sliced off 1.53 percentage points from GDP growth. Weak export growth has been tied to frigid temperatures during the winter.\n\nBusinesses accumulated $45.9 billion worth of inventories, a bit less than the $49 billion estimated last month. Inventories subtracted 1.70 percentage points from first-quarter growth, but should be a boost to second-quarter growth.Depsite the gloomy news, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose modestly in morning trading.\n  	2014-06-25

Pictures’ musical “Jersey Boys,” a Warner Bros. Pictures release. (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures, Keith Bernstein)The Associated PressAhead of his Broadway adaptation "Jersey Boys" on Friday, Clint Eastwood, 84, shares his thoughts on how to stay young, his first time acting and why America is "floundering":ON DIRECTING LATE IN LIFEADVERTISEMENTYou have more experience as you get older. You have more to draw on, as long as you dont lose your faculties. You can play on that if youre lucky enough genetically or you take good enough care of yourself, or a combination of the two. You can go ahead and experiment with things. Theres so many different stories to tell out there. You can be 21 or 81. ... If you tell yourself, "Im too old to do that" — bulls---. Youre not too old to do anything.ON HIS FIRST ACTING EXPERIENCEAs a kid, I didnt know what I wanted to do. I was forced to do a one-act play when I was in an English class. ... We had to put it on for the senior high school. This was junior high school. Jesus. We were all talking about cutting school and not showing up. And I did the play and it was successful. Everybody kept going around saying, "Oh that was fun." And I said, "Yeah, but I never want to do that again, ever." I was adamant about it. And here I am.ON AMERICAI think were floundering. Both of the last two regimes got into a spending spree that put us into a recession longer than any recession before. Everybody talks about living within your means, but nobody really wants to do it, at least in government. I have strong feelings about that because I was born in 1930. I was a Depression kid. It was a long time before my parents got stable. I lived with grandparents and various relatives while they were struggling, so its just engrained in me.ON MISSING ACTINGNo, not particularly. There are less parts as you get older. But you can also do things like "Gran Torino" where you can experiment with some of your past things.ON CASTINGSelling yourself as an actor is tough to do. You go in there, you do interviews. Theres 10, 15 guys your height, weight, everything and they all want the same thing. Youre going, "Oh, s---. What are the odds?" The odds were against me for quite a few years, say from 53 to 59. I did a lot of other jobs other than acting, thats for sure. Thats why when Im casting, I always cast off-types for stuff. Otherwise, Id hire everybody. Because Ive been there.___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jake_coyle.	2014-06-16

The Cascade Valley Hospital Foundation based in Arlington, Washington, has raised $1.7 million.Those three organizations are working together to coordinate distribution of all the local money raised, in an effort to avoid some of the problems associated with recovery in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and at disaster sites around the world. They have met regularly with service providers, government officials and other nonprofits in Arlington to avoid duplication of efforts or unfair distribution and come to agreement on how to prioritize their work.About half the money was distributed immediately, mostly in direct help for victim families including checks totaling $450,000 given directly to 52 families who lived on Steelhead Drive, the street destroyed by the mudslide. More dollars will be given directly to families as more money comes in, Parekh said.Plans made for most of the rest of the money raised so far will address long-term needs such as economic development and mental health services.In addition to the official fundraising efforts, individual families have used crowdsourcing to raise money for a variety of needs. A handful of efforts on a crowd-funding site called GoFundMe have raised a total of nearly $100,000 so far.The official and unofficial efforts havent had to work very hard to get the money flowing."Its just been pretty incredible how generous people from all over have been," said Nichole Webb Rivera, who has raised more than $25,000. Rivera lost her parents, her 19-year-old daughter and her daughters fiancee in the March 22 mudslide that killed 43 people.Rivera said she and her husband have been so inspired by what has happened since the tragedy that they are in the process of moving from Houston to Darrington, Washington, to use the money theyve raised to help rebuild the community. Rivera is debating whether to start a charity or a business cooperative to incubate small-business startups in Darrington.From the official fundraising efforts, checks of $5,000 to $10,000 have gone to everyone who either lost a home or a family member in the disaster. About $150,000 worth of gas cards have gone to people stuck behind the mudslide because they have had to drive long distances to get to work. More than $25,000 will send Darrington kids to camp this summer. About $200,000 is aimed toward economic development and relief.Nonprofit officials expect the community will have long-term economic, physical and psychological needs and some of the money raised will go toward long-term needs in Oso, Darrington and Arlington, said Colin Downey, spokesman for the Western Washington region of the American Red Cross.Although the Washington state attorney generals office has not received any complaints involving charitable solicitations for victims of the Oso slide, state officials hope people will continue to be vigilant about reporting problems and checking out groups that ask for money."Disasters typically bring out unscrupulous activity," said Rebecca Sherrill, charities program manager for the Washington Secretary of States office, which also keeps an eye on Washington charities.	2014-05-21

Becker, left, from the University of Chicago, receiving the 1992 Nobel Economics Prize from Swedens King Carl Gustaf, during the Nobel awarding ceremony in the Concert Hall in Stockholm. Becker died Saturday, May 3, 2014, at Northwestern Hospital from complications after an extended illness. He was 83. (AP Photo/Tobbe Gustavsson,File)Gary Becker, an influential economist who pioneered the use of economics in fields as diverse as crime, marriage, and education, died Saturday at the age of 83 following complications from a surgery.Using economics to uncover lessons about everyday life is now common. But before Becker, economists limited their research almost exclusively to matters of finance and money.ADVERTISEMENTBecker won a Nobel prize in 1992 for having “extended the domain” of economics, and is remembered by many.“If there’s one central figure in the revolution that broke apart the fetters around economics, it was Gary,” said Edward Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard who learned economics from Becker.Becker’s thinking revolutionized many areas. One was crime.“In the 1950s and 1960s intellectual discussions of crime were dominated by the opinion that criminal behavior was caused by mental illness and social oppression, and that criminals were helpless ‘victims,’” Gary Becker said in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 1992.“Such attitudes began to exert a major influence on social policy, [reduced] the apprehension and conviction of criminals, and provided less protection to the law-abiding population.”Becker argued, that, contrary to prevailing wisdom, criminals are often more rational than people give them credit for.“Some individuals become criminals because of the financial rewards from crime compared to legal work,” Becker argued, concluding that because of that, harsher penalties and greater enforcement would decrease crime.Over the following two decades, arrest rates and punishments generally increased and crime fell dramatically, although whether they caused the drop is still debated.Gary Becker worked closely with Milton Friedman and was also colleagues with his son, David Friedman. Friedman defended Becker’s ideas.“A lot of liberal ideology, which sees itself as pro-poor, is patronizing-- kind of saying ‘people commit crimes because they’re too stupid.’ Whereas the economic approach is to say ‘we assume everybody equally rational. That I wouldn’t want to be a criminal, but I have a different set of opportunities,’” Friedman told FoxNews.com.Crime was just one of many things Becker influenced. For example, Becker investigated why extremely popular restaurants that have long lines don’t take advantage of that by simply expanding or raise prices.The reason, Becker concluded, is that many people like going to places simply because other people also like to do so. As long as the restaurant has long lines, people can be sure they are going to a popular place. If the place expands and the lines go away, the restaurant may soon find itself with less cache and lose business.“Economists have paid insufficient attention to direct social influences on behavior,” Becker determined in a paper on the subject.Some of Becker’s contributions may seem obvious today, but were controversial when he introduced them in the 1960s. One was the idea of looking education as an economic investment – as “human capital”, as Becker called it.“Human capital is so uncontroversial nowadays that it may be difficult to appreciate the hostility in the 1950s and 1960s… The very concept of human capital was alleged to be demeaning because it treated people as machines. To approach schooling as an investment rather than a cultural experience was considered unfeeling and extremely narrow,” Becker said in his Nobel speech.Other aspects of Becker’s research are still controversial. Recently, he argued that allowing a free market in organs – in other words, allowing people to be paid for donating a kidney – would save lives.He was particularly passionate about that issue, colleague Sam Peltzman, Professor Emeritus of Economics at the University of Chicago and a colleague of Becker’s for decades, told FoxNews.com.“He pushed that idea that markets can solve problems – even against a deep revulsion to using markets for that sort of thing. Public opinion never stopped him. He was a rigorous thinker. If there was any way in which he influenced me it probably was in that,” Peltzman said.Peltzman added that Becker’s demeanor changed over the years.“I knew him way back when, and he was much younger and much less able to suffer fools – he mellowed as he got older,” Peltzman said. Becker continued to write and study economics until the end, and kept up writing on his blog up through March 2014.“He visited UCLA where I had my first job [in the 1960s]… he had the office next to mine and various members of the faculty would come and present their ideas – and he had the arrogance of youth about him, he would tell senior members of our department, “that’s a pretty good idea, but why don’t you work on it some more and come back tomorrow.”His ideas influenced many.“What part of my intellectual life is not in some way indebted to Gary Becker?” Edward Glaeser, the Harvard economist, asked rhetorically.“Becker had a moral force… the way he lived clearly showed that scholarship and teaching were more important to him than anything else. He was a phenomenal economist, and was an enormously kind and wonderful advisor, mentor, and friend,” Glaeser said.The author of this piece can be reached at maxim.lott@foxnews.com or on Twitter @maximlott	2014-05-05

Comcast reports quarterly earnings on Tuesday, April 22, 2014. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)The Associated PressPHILADELPHIA –  Comcast Corp. said Tuesday that its first-quarter net income rose by 30 percent as ad revenue surged at broadcast network NBC, helped by the Winter Olympics in Sochi and Jimmy Fallons elevation as host of "The Tonight Show."The results beat Wall Street estimates and its shares rose more than 2 percent in premarket trading.ADVERTISEMENTComcast is the largest cable company in the country with 22 million video customers and 19.8 Internet customers. It is in the midst of an expected yearlong review of its $45 billion acquisition of No. 2 rival Time Warner Cable Inc.Regulators are examining whether the combination would give it undue pricing power over customers and too much leverage with programmers.Its net income in the quarter through March rose to $1.87 billion, or 71 cents per share, from $1.44 billion, or 54 cents per share a year ago.Excluding one-time items, adjusted earnings came to 68 cents per share, beating the 64 cents expected by analysts polled by FactSet.Revenue grew 14 percent to $17.41 billion from $15.31 billion. Thats also higher than the $16.99 billion expected by analysts.NBCUniversal revenue grew 29 percent to $6.88 billion while cable services revenue grew 5 percent to $10.76 billion.Olympics broadcast rights boosted NBCU revenue by $1.1 billion. Even excluding the games, broadcast revenue rose 8 percent, helped by Fallons take-over of NBCs late night slot, replacing longtime host Jay Leno. The network was also boosted by more hours of "The Voice" and the popularity of new shows like "The Blacklist."On the cable connections side, Comcast added 24,000 video customers during the quarter, the second quarterly gain in a row following a six-and-a-half year losing streak. However, those gains are likely to come to an end in the current quarter as college students disconnect service at the end of the semester.Comcast added 383,000 high-speed data customers and 142,000 voice customers.The company says the roll-out of its newest X1 set-top box is starting to contribute to better video results. It is now setting up 15,000 to 20,000 boxes per day, up from 10,000 at the end of the year. An improved user interface is helping reduce customer disconnects while boosting video-on-demand spending and increasing uptake of digital video recorder service. Within three years, Comcast hopes the majority of its customers will have X1.Comcast shares rose $1.11, or 2.2 percent, to $50.99 in premarket trading about two hours before the market open. Its shares have fallen 4 percent in regular trading so far this year.	2014-04-22

Some members of Congress from rural states such as Kansas were already aware of the concerns, although the issue is new to many urban lawmakers.Rep. Lynn Jenkins, a Kansas Republican who grew up on a dairy farm, said agriculture must achieve technological advances to keep up with population growth, which is expected to require 60 percent more food by 2050. But she has heard farmers concerns about data collection."Information and data utilization is the way of the future," Jenkins said in an emailed statement. "And just as our federal government struggles with privacy concerns through records at the NSA and various health records, so too must we maintain appropriate privacy protection of individuals from corporate entitles."The Farm Bureau isnt sure what it needs from Washington, or whether action is even warranted yet. But farmers want their elected officials to be aware of how the industry is changing.This years trip to Washington was primarily "an educational effort" to make sure members of Congress know about the data collecting and understand "the implications of the issue for our farmers and ranchers," Steve Baccus, an Ottawa County farmer and president of the Kansas Farm Bureau. "We may need to come back at some time in the future and talk to them about legislation."Farmers worry that a hedge fund or large company with access to "real-time" yield data from hundreds of combines at harvest time might be able to use that information to speculate in commodities markets long before the government issues crop-production estimates.Others are concerned that GPS-linked farm data could be obtained by the Environmental Protection Agency, antagonistic environmental groups or, in the Farm Bureaus words, "an overall-clad Edward Snowden," a reference to the former National Security Agency analyst who disclosed intelligence-gathering operations."It is not like we dont all trust them," Mark Nelson, director of commodities for the Kansas Farm Bureau, said of agribusiness companies. The new data-collection systems deliver "a lot of good things" to producers. "But as an organization we are looking at, `What is the big picture?"The Farm Bureau Federation put together a "privacy expectation guide" to educate its members and recently drafted a policy asserting that data should remain the farmers property. The bureau also opposes allowing any federal agency to serve as a clearinghouse for proprietary or aggregated data collected by private companies.Agribusiness giant Monsanto and other corporations have tried to allay fears by reassuring farmers their data is secure and will not be used beyond providing services farmers request.This season, growers in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Minnesota can even buy for the first time a Monsanto "prescription" that offers a precise seeding recipe tailored to their soil type, disease history and pests.The St. Louis-based company, which has dominated the bioengineered seed business for more than a decade, expects to expand its prescription services to other states. It calls the advancements the "Green Data Revolution" -- a play off the so-called Green Revolution of the 20th century in which mechanical, chemical and biological advancements drove unprecedented increases in food production.Monsanto expects the use of ag data to offer comparable improvements in the next few years. It bought Precision Planting, a high-tech farm equipment maker, in 2012, followed last October by the purchase of the Climate Corporation, a data-analytics firm that provides weather-related farm services and crop insurance and is handling Monsantos fledgling data-related services.The Green Data Revolution will help farmers make more profit per acre, said Dave Friedberg, chief executive officer of The Climate Corporation. The average farmer, he says, wont have to be "tech savvy.""Tech will just become integral to the work that they do ... in the same way that more than 100 years ago, we adopted machine-based farming equipment as the standard in the industry," Friedberg said.Companies are also pushing an Open Ag Data Alliance, which would set uniform data standards and allow systems built by different manufacturers to talk to one another.Farm equipment manufacturer John Deere has partnered with DuPont Pioneer to tout what it calls "Decision Services," a system in which farmers upload data onto servers that respond by sending seed and fertilizer prescriptions directly to Deere tractors in the field. Other companies offer services that let farmers connect a tablet computer to the seed monitor in the cab and download the information.Farm groups are conflicted about what role, if any, government should have in regulating data-gathering practices."We dont believe ultimately there is a legislative fix for this," said Terry Holdren, chief executive officer and general counsel for the Kansas Farm Bureau. "It is a contractual model for folks who have technology and folks who want technology."Nick Guetterman, who farms roughly 10,000 acres of corn and wheat with his father and three brothers in eastern Kansas, already uses GPS technology and has been considering sending all his data to a specialized service. But he still has reservations about what a seed company or an equipment manufacturer will do with it."I have not found it on my farm beneficial enough to pay them to analyze my data," Guetterman said. "I either analyze it myself or do nothing with it."	2014-03-29

The statement did not identify the suspect or specify if he is a student at Spring High School, where Wednesdays attacks occurred. No charges have been filed."We believe a confrontation of some sort occurred ... that ultimately led into a physical confrontation that produced weapons," Sheriff Adrian Garcia said. "There has been some information that this may have been gang related."Two victims were hospitalized with minor injuries. A third, identified only as a 16-year-old, was in surgery. No other information was available on the teenager who was killed.Garcia said a "cutting instrument" was used in the attack but offered no details.Some parents said the fight was the continuation of a disturbance that broke out Tuesday. Officials at the school, which has about 3,500 students, would not confirm their comments."Every parent sends their child to school believing school should be one of those safe haven places," Spring Independent School District Superintendent Ralph Draper said. "This is what we spend our nights and days working toward and what I lose sleep over."In my nearly 30-year career, this is the one thing you pray never to experience."Parent Tara Campbell said she received text messages from her daughter about the fight and that her daughter said students who witnessed the episode snapped cellphone photos of the victims as they lay on the ground.Campbell said she intended to have her daughter home-schooled, saying shes grown tired of fights at the school."Last year there were gang fights consistently," she said. "This is ridiculous. This is an ongoing situation."Lakesia Brent said her son, a sophomore at the school, sent her multiple text messages asking her to come pick him up."Hes just afraid," she said, adding that fights at the school were a problem in the last academic year.The school was placed on lockdown following the stabbings, which occurred about 7 a.m., and students were released to the care of their parents later Wednesday.Many parents were upset that the school district did not provide them information in a timely manner.Draper defended the districts actions, saying they focused on two goals — securing the school and making sure no action was taken to compromise the investigation — before communicating information to parents about what had happened. He said students were not immediately released because some of them were potential witnesses who needed to be interviewed by investigators."When street violence pours into the school, it compromises the safety of all our students," Draper said.	2013-09-04

The Commerce Department releases durable goods for January on Thursday, Feb. 27, 2014. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  American businesses ordered fewer durable manufactured goods in January, cutting demand for planes, autos and machines. But a key category that reflects business investment rebounded on the strength of demand for electronics and fabricated metals.The Commerce Department said Thursday that orders for durable goods fell a seasonally adjusted 1 percent in January from December. Much of the decline was driven by a 20.2 percent drop in demand for commercial aircraft, a volatile month-to-month category. Orders for all transportation-related equipment fell 5.6 percent.ADVERTISEMENTMore encouragingly, orders rose 1.7 percent in a closely watched category, known as core capital goods, which excludes volatile transportation and defense orders. This category had dropped 1.8 percent in December.Economists track this category to determine whether business investment is expanding. Last months rebound nearly erased all of Decembers decline, a sign that companies might anticipate more business during spring.Frigid weather and snowstorms have cut into factory output in recent months. As manufacturing has slowed, the effects have echoed across the economy to dampen hiring, retail demand and home sales.Manufacturers made fewer cars and trucks, appliances, furniture and carpeting in January, as cold weather delayed shipments of raw materials and caused some factories to shut down, the Federal Reserve has reported. Factory production plummeted 0.8 percent last month, ending five straight months of gains.The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, said its index of manufacturing activity fell to 51.3 in January, from 56.5 in December. It was the lowest reading since May, though any reading above 50 signals growth in manufacturing.The broad slowdown emerged after the economy had picked up momentum during the final half of 2013.Retail sales tumbled last month, including a 2.1 percent dip in auto purchases. Sales of existing U.S. homes plummeted in January to the slowest pace in 18 months, according to the National Association of Realtors.Most economists say the economy will pivot to stronger growth this year after a halting recovery that followed the recessions end in June 2009. Many analysts are forecasting the economy will grow by around 3 percent in 2014, an increase of more than a percentage point for 2013.Much of the hope for a better 2014 reflects a belief that the federal government will be less of a drag this year. In 2013, higher taxes and across-the-board spending cuts trimmed about 1.5 percentage points from growth.	2014-02-27
664	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/03/27/california-controversial-6b-rail-project-must-employ-disadvantaged-workers/	Californias $68B rail project will hire the disadvantaged -- like felons and dropouts	California High-Speed Rail Authority officials say a completed system will eliminate the need to spend more than $150 billion on 4,300 new lane-miles of highway, 115 additional gates at airports and four new airport runways. (CAHighSpeedRail.ca.gov.)What do high school dropouts, convicted felons and union apprentices have in common?They’re all “disadvantaged” workers who — alongside veterans, former foster children and single parents — must account for at least 10 percent of the labor force behind California’s $68 billion high-speed rail project. By 2029, the state’s High-Speed Rail Authority hopes to send commuters hurtling at 200 mph between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The 800-mile system with up to 24 stations will eventually extend to Sacramento and San Diego, but some critics — and even former proponents of the megaproject — are now questioning its viability.ADVERTISEMENTRandal OToole, a senior fellow at Cato Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said his biggest concern is not the unconventional workforce demand, but that the electrically-powered train system is really a "political project" aimed at fattening the wallets of well-connected unions, contractors, engineers and associated firms."Theres a lot of money to be made out of building this and the whole goal of high-speed rail is to make that money, to transfer money from taxpayers into the pockets of selected supporters of the Obama administration," OToole told FoxNews.com. "It always comes back to politics."Regarding the disadvantaged workers aspect of the project, OToole said he found some value in educating less-fortunate workers, particularly if its seen as a Progress Administration-type project, or one primarily aimed at stimulating the economy."On the other hand, is it really going to get them jobs in the future when the high-speed rail project is done? Its probably not going to be that valuable for them," he continued.But oversight of the massive project will be its biggest hurdle, OToole claims, rather than vetting the workers who will build it."Nobodys ever spent this much money on one project before, and its questionable whether we can," he said. "There will be somebody riding it, but does it justify the billions youre going to spend to get it?"Quentin Kopp, the former chair of the state’s Senate transportation committee who co-wrote legislation launching the project, recently filed a legal declaration contained in a civil suit seeking to halt it, reportedly claiming the system as currently planned violates the law underpinning $9.95 billion in state funding approved by voters in 2008."They have just mangled this project," Kopp told the Los Angeles Times. "They distorted it. We dont get a high-speed rail system. It is the great train robbery."In Kopp’s declaration, the former judge claims the plan approved last year by transit officials violated several voter-imposed requirements, including that construction occur in “usable segments” throughout California and that funding to complete each segment be secured prior to the start of shovels striking the ground.- Quentin Kopp, former chair of the state’s Senate transportation committee who co-wrote legislation launching the projectBut Kopp claims the current plan to build 130 miles of rail in the Central Valley for $6 billion beginning this summer will not produce a usable segment. The first feasible segment of service within the plan would connect Merced to the San Fernando Valley at an estimated cost of $31 billion — funds that the recession-weary state does not have, according to Kopp’s declaration.Authority officials, in a statement to FoxNews.com, said the project is "moving forward" as originally planned."We are moving forward with the high-speed rail program which was recommended by the states independent panel of experts, approved by the legislature and previously supported by Mr. Kopp," the statement read.Dan Richard, chairman of the California High Speed Rail Authority, told the Los Angeles Times that Kopp’s lawsuit is wrong, both factually and legally. Deals to share sections of urban track with slower commuter rail systems and to send massive investments to Southern California and Bay Area transit agencies were crucial to securing statewide political support for the project, he said."It is one thing to sit back and criticize, and it is another thing to build something," Richard told the newspaper. "We have made tremendous progress."Other critics of the project, meanwhile, have focused on a policy contained in a request for proposals issued to contractors in December to reserve a portion of the construction jobs for certain disadvantaged groups, including those who have been convicted of a crime."Theres another chapter in the high-speed fail saga, and I almost cant do this one with a straight face,” Assemblyman Brian Jones, R-Santee, said in a recent video series in which he shares political frustrations. “What a social engineering disaster this is going to be, and add to Californias laughingstock reputation."Rather than hiring those “most in need,” Jones suggested putting to work someone who is duly qualified for the job.“California needs to stop trying to help those who don’t want to help themselves and find those that really do want to work,” Jones said.Despite those concerns, several powerful Democrats continue to back the plan, including Gov. Jerry Brown, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and President Obama. Voter support, however, has largely evaporated since 2008. A recent statewide survey found that 54 percent of likely voters now oppose the project.“Californians’ continuing concern about the economy and the state and federal budgets make planning for the future a difficult process,” said Mark Baldassare, president and CEO of the Public Policy Institute of California.California High-Speed Rail Authority officials, meanwhile, said that a completed system will eliminate the need to spend more than $150 billion on 4,300 new lane-miles of highway, 115 additional gates at airports and four new airport runways. The first phase of construction would directly employ roughly 3,500 people. All told, as many as 100,000 construction-related jobs would be created during each year the system is built and would reduce dependence on foreign oil by up to 12.7 million barrels per year.In Fresno County, where unemployment hovers above 14 percent, the Fresno Regional Workforce Investment Board (FRWIB) is reportedly fielding so many calls from prospective workers that a rail-specific website is being prepared to help screen applicants once construction begins."The question is, the task that we have, which I hope does not become a herculean task, is that we have to be sure that the people we are going to refer over are competitive," FRWIB Executive Director Blake Konczal told the Sacramento Bee. "The contractors dont have to hire anybody if theyre not qualified, so our job is to make sure that the local people that we refer over are screened, that they receive adequate training and that theyre ready to go."	2013-03-27

The successful applicant will open and close the Fed’s gold vault each day and conduct tours for foreign dignitaries, bank execs and VIPs. He or she must have a college degree or equivalent work experience, people skills and be willing to work overtime. Oh, and he or she must be able to lift up to 50 pounds of gold at a time.ADVERTISEMENT"A Gold Vault Custody Analyst is charged with performing all of the critical responsibilities associated with safekeeping, accounting for, and displaying all gold entrusted to the FRBNY," reads the official job posting.The vaults are visited by more than 25,000 foreign dignitaries, VIPs, bank officers and members of the general public annually. From the sound of the posting, the analyst is part tour guide, part schmoozer and part warehouse worker.The salary is not listed in the posting.The analyst will also have to play tour guide and also be one part bank teller as they will have to administer the “Public Window” to receive, pay and account for limited currency transactions.The list of qualifications reads like that of a typical office position, requiring an undergraduate college degree or an equivalent in work experience, strong interpersonal skills and an “acute sense of attention to detail.”Officials with the Federal Reserve in New York refused to comment when reached by FoxNews.com. It was not immediately clear how many applicants have applied for the job.The Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks vault is the world’s largest, holding an estimated half-trillion dollars worth of gold. That’s about a quarter of the entire world’s reserves. But most of the gold doesn’t even belong to the U.S. Gold belonging to 48 foreign central banks and 12 international organizations including the International Monetary Fund are stored there, in more than 500,000 bars, each weighing 27.4 pounds. The Fed stores the gold for free, but depositors pay a fee each time a bar is moved.If you’re considering taking the job to pull off a heist, stop now. Iron bars cover the windows of the first three floors of the building. Armed guards patrol the surrounding blocks with automatic weapons. The vault, about half the size of a football field, rests in bedrock 30 feet below the subway system in Lower Manhattan.

In addition, the national unemployment rate was on an upward trajectory in 2008 that would extend well into the following year.Those are some of the reasons the mortgage delinquency rate didnt hit its peak of nearly 7 percent until the fourth quarter of 2009, according to TransUnion.The rate has been trending down since then, aided by a rebound in home sales and rising home prices, which make it easier for borrowers to refinance their mortgages or sell their homes if they lose their jobs or otherwise become unable to make payments.Home loans taken out in 2008 or earlier account for 60 percent of all U.S. mortgages, and they make up 90 percent of all mortgages that are at least two months late, said Tim Martin, group vice president of U.S. housing for TransUnion.Many of those loans have gone unpaid for years, but delays in the foreclosure process, which in some states can take as long as three years, mean the mortgages remain unpaid."Whats really going on is therere a lot of folks who have been delinquent for a very long time, and were not really adding a lot of new people to the delinquency numbers," Martin said.The number of mortgages gone unpaid two months or more climbed 54 percent in 2007 from the previous year, increased 53 percent in 2008 and rose 50 percent in 2009, according to TransUnion.The decline has been far slower, with mortgage delinquency levels falling 7 percent in 2010 from the year before, 6 percent in 2011 and 14 percent last year, the firm said.All told the 40 percent of all mortgages taken out by borrowers since 2009 only make up 10 percent of home loans that have gone unpaid.Thats partly due to lenders tightening the criteria needed to qualify for a loan, including larger down payments. And even with mortgage rates hovering near all-time lows, borrowers are typically getting fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages these days."Thats had the effect that those borrowers are able to make their payments," Martin said.Thats kept the mortgage delinquency rate from creeping higher. Still, the trove of pre-2009 loans that are behind two months or more remain a considerable drag.Even at a 4-year low, the mortgage delinquency rate is still well above the 1 percent to 2 percent average historical range, an indication that many homeowners still are struggling to make their payments.Before the housing bust, mortgage delinquencies were running at less than 2 percent nationally.TransUnion anticipates the national mortgage delinquency rate will continue declining through the end of March, though it expects the rate to remain above 5 percent.At the state level, Florida led the nation in the fourth quarter with the highest mortgage delinquency rate of any state at 12.47 percent. It was followed by Nevada at 10.45 percent; New Jersey at 7.72 percent; and, Maryland at 6.88 percent.The states with the lowest delinquency rate were North Dakota at 1.53 percent; South Dakota at 1.97 percent; Nebraska at 2.20 percent; and, Alaska at 2.20 percent.	2013-02-12

Job growth is strengthening. And stocks are setting record highs.All of which explains why Americans are more hopeful about the economy than at any other point in five years.ADVERTISEMENTConsider Michael Quintos, head of a Chicago advertising agency that helps small businesses market themselves through social media. Quintos sees more optimism at work and among friends and relatives."A year ago, I had more friends asking me if I knew anybody who was hiring," he says. "Now I have more people who are hiring asking me if I know anyone looking for a job."At work, Quintos is finding it easier to land customers. In the past couple of months, businesses that have asked about his services have been more likely to follow through and hire him. A year ago, most were wary."Ive had more work than I can handle," Quintos says. As a result, his firm hired a web designer last week.Investors on Tuesday celebrated the latest buoyant reports on consumer confidence and housing prices, which together suggest that growth could accelerate in the second half of 2013.Greater confidence could spur people to spend more and help offset tax increases and federal spending cuts. And the fastest rise in home prices in seven years might lead more Americans to put houses on the market, easing supply shortages that have kept the housing recovery from taking off.A report from the Conference Board, a private research group, showed that consumer confidence jumped in May to a reading of 76.2, up from 69 in April. Thats the highest level since February 2008, two months after the Great Recession officially began.A separate report showed that U.S. home prices jumped nearly 11 percent in March compared with a year ago, the sharpest 12-month increase since April 2006. Prices rose year over year in all 20 cities in the Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller home price index.The economic news helped send the Dow Jones industrial average up 106 points to close at a record. The Dow has rocketed nearly 18 percent this year. And the Standard & Poors 500 stock index is on track for its seventh straight monthly gain, the longest winning streak since 2009.Surging stock prices and steady home-price increases have allowed Americans to regain the $16 trillion in wealth they lost to the Great Recession. Higher wealth tends to embolden people to spend more. Some economists have said the increase in home prices alone could boost consumer spending enough to offset a Social Security tax increase that has reduced paychecks for most Americans this year.The Conference Board survey said consumers are also more optimistic about the next six months. That should translate into greater consumer spending, substantial growth in hiring and faster economic growth in the second half of 2013, says Thomas Feltmate, an economist with TD Economics.The boards survey found that optimism is growing mostly among those earning more than the median household income of roughly $50,000. For those households, the confidence index jumped to 95.1 from 85.3.Among most other income groups, confidence either rose more slowly or fell. For those earning $15,000 to $24,999, for example, the confidence index rose modestly, from 52.6 to 55.9. And for those earning $25,000 to $34,999, it slipped from 59.8 to 57.9.Economists say the disparity points to the gain in stock prices, which mostly benefits more affluent Americans.Consumers outlook on the job market also improved last month. The percentage who said jobs are plentiful rose, and the percentage who said theyre hard to find declined. Economists say the shift suggests that the pace of hiring could pick up.The economy has added an average of 208,000 jobs a month since November. Thats well above the monthly average of 138,000 during the previous six months. The job growth has helped reduce the unemployment rate to a four-year low of 7.5 percent.Some of the decline in unemployment is due to fewer people looking for work. The government counts people as unemployed only if theyre actively searching for a job.The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the January-March quarter, up from a rate of just 0.4 percent in the October-December quarter. The fastest expansion in consumer spending in more than two years drove the economys growth.Many economists think growth is slowing slightly in the April-June quarter to an annual rate between 2 percent and 2.5 percent. But lots of analysts say growth should strengthen in the second half of the year, boosted by the gains in housing and employment.A key reason the Case-Shiller index of home prices jumped in March was that a growing number of buyers were bidding on a tight supply of homes.In Phoenix, prices rose by 22.5 percent over the past 12 months, the biggest gain among cities. That was followed by San Francisco (22.2 percent) and Las Vegas (20.6 percent)."Rising home prices may begin to alleviate a lack of housing inventory ... by encouraging more homeowners to put their properties on the market," Maninder Sibia, an economist with Economic Advisory Service, said in a research note.Builders are responding to the supply shortage by ramping up construction. Applications for building permits rose in April to the highest level in nearly five years. The supply of available homes jumped in April but was still 14 percent below its level a year earlier.Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow, a real estate data provider, says the increase in the Case-Shiller index has been skewed higher by cities such as Phoenix and San Francisco. Fewer homes are available in those areas because many homeowners still owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. That makes it difficult to sell.Yet even excluding those markets, prices are rising steadily nationwide, Humphries says. The increases are "certainly confirmation that the housing market is experiencing a brisk recovery," he adds.Rising prices typically encourage more would-be buyers to purchase homes before prices rise further. They also enable more homeowners to sell homes by reducing the number of people who owe more on their mortgages than the homes are worth.Prices have been rising steadily since last summer. There are still about 29 percent below the peak reached in July 2006.Banks have raised their credit standards since the housing bubble burst and are demanding larger down payments. Thats made it hard for some potential first-time buyers to get a mortgage.One potential obstacle to further economic gains is that workers pay is rising only modestly. Without faster growth in pay, some consumers may be reluctant to keep spending more."If you dont think your income is going up, you will not be exuberant in your spending," notes Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors.Stronger hiring, though, would enable more people to spend freely. Naroff expects the pace of job creation to average 175,000 to 200,000 a month for the rest of the year.At that rate, the Federal Reserve might be inclined to slow its aggressive bond purchases — $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bonds. The bond purchases have been intended to drive down long-term loan rates to encourage borrowing and spending.Super-low rates have also helped fuel the stock rally. But some investors have grown nervous that that Fed may soon start to curtail its pace of bond purchases and that rates could creep up.	2013-05-29

NEW YORK –  Januarys global sell-off in stocks has left many small investors more puzzled than panicked — and unsure how to act.Theyre holding on for now as prices continue to tumble, but their anxiety is mounting. The number of small investors who say they feel "bearish" soared this past week, according to a U.S. survey. Some stock funds have been hit with their biggest withdrawals since 2012.ADVERTISEMENTIf more people start selling, it would reverse a new and surprising trend in some of the worlds biggest economies: individuals moving back into stocks after years of shunning them."I dont know what to do," says Ken Duska, a retiree in Mingo Junction, Ohio, who is sticking with his investment plan for the moment, though hes not sure thats wise. "After (the) upswing last year, it probably isnt going to continue."Small investors around the world were on edge even before growing signs of a slowdown in China and plunging emerging-market currencies dragged many stock indexes down to their worst start of a new year since 2010. They worried stocks were overdue for a drop, after soaring by double-digit percentages in countries like the United States, Japan and France in 2013. In the U.S., many noted, the market had not fallen by 10 percent or more, known on Wall Street as a correction, for more than two years.Now, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 5 percent from a recent peak, one is closer at hand."The question is, Is this all of it, or is there significantly more to come?" says Greg Sarian, a managing director at the Sarian Group at HighTower, a wealth advisory firm in Pennsylvania.Anxiety has ramped up in Asia, too."Clients were very worried as they havent seen such market jitters in a while," says Lee Young-hwan, a private banking consultant at Daishin Securities Co. in Seoul, South Korea. Still, he says that many are more inclined to snap up stocks now at lower prices, than to bail out.That countrys main index, the Kospi, is down 3.5 percent since the start of the year. In Japan, the Nikkei is off 8.5 percent, after soaring 58 percent last year. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong has fallen nearly 5.5 percent, after a 3 percent gain.In Moscow, where the main stock index has been dropping for a year, Marina Pliskina, an English teacher, decided shed finally had enough. She recently sold all of her stocks. "You want your money to last, but then it goes down and down," she says.Since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, small investors have mostly dumped stocks. But recently, buoyed by strengthening economies in the developed world, they have crept back into the market in some countries.In the final four months of last year, nearly $100 billion flowed into stock mutual funds in seven big economies tracked by Lipper Inc., a fund data provider. The countries are the U.S., which accounted for much of the buying, as well as Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Canada and South Korea.Now, that flow of money might reverse as investors grow worried.At the start of the year, more than twice as many U.S. investors said they were bullish on stocks than said they were bearish, according to a survey by the American Association of Individual Investors. Now, the bulls and bears are neck and neck, with sentiments yo-yoing along with the indexes."Ive lost ... maybe $50,000 in the past week, and Im not happy about it," says Scott Woodall, 44, of Acworth, Ga. "I hate the stock market."The global tumble started more than a week ago after China reported economic growth had slowed and a key manufacturing measure suggested that sector was contracting. Stocks dropped in developing countries, along with their currencies, on fears that exports of iron ore, soybeans, electronic components and other goods to China would slow.Adding to the emerging-world woes were some homegrown problems — double-digit inflation in Argentina, for instance, and a corruption probe in Turkey that threatens to destabilize the government. Then, on Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it would be pulling back even more from its bond-buying program.That buying has helped pushed U.S. interest rates to record lows, and sent investors to emerging markets in search of higher yields. Now the tide of cash is reversing, hammering those economies as investors pull money out.A sign of the times: The price of gold, considered the ultimate "safe" asset by spooked investors, is up 3.5 percent this year after plunging 28 percent in 2013. Investors are also buying U.S Treasury bonds, another refuge in fearful times, despite the Fed decision to scale back its purchases. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note, which falls when prices rise, has dropped from 3 percent at the start of the year to 2.65 percent, a big move.There were other signs Friday that fear might be spreading.In the U.S., the Standard and Poors 500 index, a broader measure than the Dow, was down 0.7 percent, a fifth loss in seven trading sessions. That said, the index is well shy of a correction. It is down 3.6 percent from its record close on Jan. 15.Stocks in Germany also fell Friday, helping to push the countrys DAX index down nearly 3 percent in January, despite a strong economy and a low unemployment rate.So far, some small investors seem willing to ride out the storm, though they dont sound too happy.Leighanne Franklin, a mental health therapist in Greenwood, N.Y., wonders whether U.S. stocks are "just another bubble." But she is adding to her retirement account anyway, partly because she doesnt want to miss out on matching funds from her employer. "Its better than putting it in a savings account," she says.Eric Rogers, a home builder in Independence, Ore., says stocks are "inflated," and that he isnt surprised that trouble in emerging countries has pushed the market down.Still, the 44-year-old is holding onto stocks in his IRA, figuring he can ride out any drops over time."Itll be wonderful for me in 20 years," he says, "but right now ... I cant touch it."___AP Business Writer Youkyung Lee in Seoul, South Korea, and David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, contributed to this report.	2014-02-01
884	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/02/16/cosmetic-tweaks-to-ar-15-thwart-new-york-ban-on-assault-rifles/	Cosmetic tweaks to AR-15 thwart New Yorks ban on assault rifles	Simple design tweaks are allowing gun makers to get around restrictions New York put in place following the 2012 school shootings in Connecticut, prompting some critics to say the laws were mere window dressing. New York lawmakers passed the SAFE Act last year, and announced with fanfare that it effectively banned the sale of “assault weapons.” But AR-15s, the most popular type of guns often referred to as assault weapons, are sold in Empire State gun shops, freely and legally. The gun is being marketed by Stag Arms as a "New York-compliant AR-15," and features a slightly modified stock and no bells and whistles. The gun does not have a pistol grip, for instance - one of the features banned by the act.ADVERTISEMENT"This just shows that the gun prohibition lobby uses symbolic gestures over substance to push their anti-gun rights agenda. Banning guns based on cosmetic features proves that point," Alan Gottlieb, president of the Second Amendment Foundation, told FoxNews.com.- Alan Gottlieb, Second Amendment FoundationGun-rights supporters say it illustrates that so-called “assault weapons” – an often-used term with no single definition – are usually no more dangerous than hunting rifles. The "AR" in AR-15 does not stand for "assault rifle," as commonly believed, but for "Armalite Rifle."In New York, an assault weapon is defined as any semi-automatic rifle that accepts a magazine and has any of a list of ten features, ranging from a pistol-like grip to a flash suppressor to a bayonet mount.Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, and the Violence Policy Center – all groups that support more gun control – declined to comment or did not answer questions from FoxNews.com about the effectiveness of assault-weapons bans.The New York Attorney General’s office referred questions to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office, which did not respond.Cuomo’s website boasts that the state has “the toughest assault weapons ban in the country” and that “under the legislation, the Bushmaster used in the Newtown, Conn., shooting will be illegal.”Gottlieb said that may be well-intentioned but is ineffective at best.“Some of the guns they’re banning are the safest guns," he said. "There aren’t many accidents committed with Bushmaster rifles, and there are a number of times that so-called assault rifles have been used in self defense.”Some gun dealers in New York State say they are glad to be selling AR-15s again.“Believe it or not, if I had a hundred of things to sell, they’d already be gone. I’m hoping to have them in my shop in the next two weeks,” Justin Reickart, who runs H&H Guns in southwestern New York, told FoxNews.com.“We’ve already showed it to about a dozen people, just a picture of what its going to be, and the younger generation – they already love it. They’re like, it’s same gun, just with a sci-fi looking stock. The suggested retail price is going to be $1,050. Prior to the ban, you would have been able to buy the gun for $949 – so it adds $100, to make it New York compliant.”Asked why people want AR-15s, Reickart said they are simply good guns.“It’s a universal gun that you can put in anybody’s hands… I’ve used it for coyote hunting, deer hunting... it’s a fun and enjoyable gun to shoot,” he said.Reickart got attention last year when he developed his own AR-15 which he believed complied with New York law – but he decided not to actually sell the gun because the State Attorney General would not give written confirmation that it followed state law.For New York gun owners with existing non-compliant AR-15s, they either have to register their gun with the state by April 15 or modify it to comply with the law.Some gun owners are hesitant to register their guns, some for fear that the list would later be used for gun confiscation as just recently happened in New York City.To avoid that, some owners of old AR-15s are modifying them so that they no longer classify as “assault weapons.” One company, S&B Products, offers a “spur” to replace the pistol grip.“The New York State Police have told us that by removing all of the prohibited design characteristics the  rifle is no longer considered an "assault weapon" and is therefore not subject to the registration requirement,” Steve Byron, President of S&B Products, told FoxNews.com.Byron said he thought the triviality of the modifications shows that the law is not productive.“I believe politicians should not write and pass laws about something they know nothing about,” he said.The author of the piece can be reached on twitter at @maximlott or at maxim.lott@foxnews.com	2014-02-16
958	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/02/23/arizona-parks-program-helps-homeless-veterans-become-rangers/	Arizona parks program helps homeless veterans become rangers	Working as an Arizona State Park Ranger isnt just a job for Army veteran Carlos Garcia, its a second chance.Under a program the state launched in partnership with a host of public and private agencies to put homeless veterans to work, he is earning $12 an hour and living in a FEMA trailer. He is taking part in the Arizona Action Plan to End Homelessness Among Veterans, and he said it has changed his life.\n\n“I was homeless,” Garcia said. “I was out of work for about two years and I had gotten into a little bit of trouble so this program boosted me, my morale -- its just helped me out a lot. Im glad to be working again.”\n\nGarcia is one of four veterans participating in the pilot program that helps veterans get off the streets by making them park rangers. He currently works and lives at Dead Horse Ranch State Park, in Cottonwood.ADVERTISEMENTBryan Martyn, executive director of Arizona’s State Parks, and himself an Air Force veteran who flew special ops, said taxpayers get a good deal when the state hires veterans.“I know the skill sets the veterans have," Martyn said. "I know they can do this job.”Martyn himself was recently suspended for two weeks by state officials for another hiring practice - putting his three sons on the payroll as "temporary park specialists," a job which also pays $12 an hour, according to the Arizona Republic. One of Martyn’s sons was employed for a month, and the others worked for about two weeks before state personnel officials ordered they be terminated because the hiring violated the state’s employment-of-relatives statute. Martyn told investigators he did not know employing a family member violated state statute.Martyns boss, Gov. Jan Brewer, says helping veterans provide for themselves is the least taxpayers can do. Brewer started the wider program, and encouraged agencies like Martyns to get involved."For far too long, homeless veterans have been deprived of the comforts and security that most of us take for granted — blessings, ironically, that they themselves faced injury and death to secure for their fellow citizens," Brewer wrote in a recent Op-Ed.Martyn said he wanted to help homeless veterans after he heard a staggering statistic one morning."I was listening to the radio coming into work one day and there was a story about the suicide rate on veterans and the number was unbelievable – twenty-two a day. Twenty-two veterans a day were taking their lives and I had an exec staff meeting that morning and said, we gotta do something!” Martyn said.“Im trying to give these guys a skill, let them get their life back together, put something on your resume other than kicking in doors or driving tanks,” Martyn says. "We ensure that we work with the Veterans Administration and get these guys counseling services that are available and the VA has been great about providing follow-up and checking on them.”So far, Garcia has saved money, lost twenty-five pounds and even reconnected with his family.\n\n“Emotionally, spiritually, mentally, physically - its helped me out a lot. Im grateful to be here and its an awesome opportunity and a great experience,” Garcia said.	2014-02-23

Fully half of its 30,000 employees are already overseas."Right now (ADM is) the only thing going on around here," said 36-year-old unemployed contractor Shawn Flaherty. Hes been laid off for six months — the first time ever, he says — after working 10 years for a general contractor where his work was mostly for ADM.But its more than just jobs, other say.The city will be losing the headquarters of its biggest employer, the economic titan that gives Decatur significance beyond its size. It might just have about 75,000 residents, but Decatur has the nerve center for a company thats ranked No. 27 on the Fortune 500 list and generates tens of billions of dollars in sales every year."It hurts — it really does hurt. But you move forward," City Council member Pat McDaniel said, adding that he understands the companys decisions and had heard rumors for years that this day might come. "Its tough to compete against large metropolitan communities like Chicago or New York. They can offer things that we cant."Thats essentially what the company said Monday when it announced its looking for a new home."Our company is growing and becoming more global and more customer-centric," CEO Patricia Woertz said. "To continue to succeed, we need a global center in a location that allows us to travel and work efficiently with customers and employees throughout the world. We also need an environment where we can attract and retain employees with diverse skills, and where family members can find ample career opportunities."Decatur lacks, among other things, a major airport, spokeswoman Victoria Podesta added. Its also a difficult place to recruit some types of employees to, such as tech workers and marketers, she said.And Chicago, city officials there said, has been talking to ADM and is on what the company says is a short list of potential destinations."This is a dynamic, global company that is a leader in a key industry, and we believe that they are a good fit with what Chicago has to offer," spokesman Tom Alexander said. "Well do our best to keep them in Illinois."ADM says it wont discuss potential locations, details of its decision-making process or when it expects to decide.Gov. Pat Quinn has also been talking to the company, his office said."Were going to continue to have discussion with this company as we always do, continue to partner with them," Quinn spokeswoman Brooke Anderson said. She did not know if ADM has sought incentives.ADMs headquarters is also a source of prestige for Illinois, which has grown accustomed to watching other states try to swoop in and lure companies away as the states economy has struggled the past few years.The company and its focus on soybeans, corn, ethanol and a wide range of food additives and other products bring businesspeople from around the world to the state, McDaniel pointed out.ADM first built a plant in Decatur because of the areas focus on soybeans. The company moved its headquarters to town from Minneapolis in the 1960s.Robert Laskowski, 61, is a Decatur native and owner of a CD and DVD store downtown. He says local residents get jittery when theres uncertainty at ADM, but hes confident the manufacturing jobs, at least, will stay."This is where their product is — corn and soybeans," he said.And theres the new North American headquarters Decatur will become.The company says it doesnt yet know what exactly that will include.But University of Illinois economist Fred Giertz called it a "good second-place prize" for Decatur."Winning is good, but not losing is not bad either if thats Decaturs only alternative."___Associated Press writer Sophia Tareen contributed to this report from Chicago.

They put the fruit-and-vegetable farm up for sale in the summer of 2010 as they dealt with competition from supermarkets, pick-it-yourself farms and debt.ADVERTISEMENTThe original price was $3.35 million. Fosters Daily Democrat reports it sold last month for a little over $1 million to Matt Kozazcki, who owns a farm in Newbury, Mass."Its huge," Kozazcki told the paper. "Its a lot of heritage. Were trying to make it as much of a farm as possible. You cant forget the Tuttles. I can appreciate the work they did," Kozazcki told the paper.Kozazcki calls the business Tendercrop Farm and plans to sell meat and produce starting in December.Kozazcki said he plans to install a memorial plaque honoring the Tuttles near the farm store entrance.The New York Times columnist Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote a piece in 2010 when the farm went out of business. She points out that the farm was founded when there were, maybe, 10,000 colonists in America."It is too simple to say, as the Tuttles have, that the recession killed a farm that had survived for nearly 400 years. What killed it was the economic structure of food production. Each year it has become harder for family farms to compete with industrial scale agriculture — heavily subsidized by the government — underselling them at every turn," Klinkenborg wrote. "In a system committed to the health of farms and their integration with local communities, the result would have been different. In 1632, and for many years after, the Tuttle farm was a necessity. In 2010, it is suddenly superfluous, or so we like to pretend."The Associated Press contributed to this report 	2013-11-05

One tweet from his account reads, "90% of white ppl are nasty. #HATE THEM." Another post read, "Ayeee I knocced out 5 woods since Zimmerman court!:)"ADVERTISEMENTThe Daily Callers report noted that woods is used as a derogatory term for white people.Edwards and friend Chancey Allen Luna, 16, were both charged with first-degree murder as adults Tuesday and are being held without bond in the town of Duncan, which is about 30 miles southwest of Oklahoma City.Bond was set at $1 million for 17-year-old Michael Jones, who allegedly drove the vehicle carrying the other suspects.  He was charged with the use of a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and accessory to murder after the fact. Jones is considered a youthful offender but will be tried in adult court.Jones named Luna as the gunman, police said.Police Chief Dan Ford said the victim, Chris Lane, 22, appeared to have been chosen at random, saying in a variety of media interviews since Fridays killing that one suspect told officers that he and other boys were bored and that they followed Lane and killed him for "the fun of it."Lane was on a baseball scholarship at East Central University in Ada, Okla., and was in Duncan, Okla., visiting his girlfriend when he was shot and killed. Some bystanders tried to perform CPR on Lane, but he was unconscious and stopped breathing before an ambulance arrived.Lanes killing has attracted international attention about a month after George Zimmerman, a community watch organizer who fatally shot an unarmed black teen, was acquitted by a Florida jury in a racially charged case.Rev. Jesse Jackson said in a tweet Wednesday that he was "praying for the family of Chris Lane. This senseless violence is frowned upon and the justice system must prevail."Prosecutor Jason Hicks called the boys "thugs" in court, saying Luna was sitting in the rear seat of a car when he pulled the trigger on a .22 caliber revolver and shot Lane once in the back. Hicks said Jones was driving the vehicle and Edwards was in the passenger seat.Edwards has had run-ins with the law previously and had been in court Friday, the day of the killing, to sign documents related to his juvenile probation.Peter Lane, meanwhile, told Australian media there was no explanation for his sons death."It is heartless and to try to understand it is a short way to insanity," he said.Lane met Sarah Harper, a collegiate golfer from Duncan. Friends expected them to marry after graduation."They were really a good couple and fun to be around," Newgent said.Harper transferred to Oklahoma Christian University in Edmond during Lanes last year at Redlands. When Lane was looking to move from the community college to a four-year college to finish his degree, he wanted to stay in Oklahoma "because Sarah was in Oklahoma," Newgent said.Lane and Harper had recently returned from a trip to Australia, and Lane was visiting Harper and her parents in Duncan, a south-central Oklahoma city of about 24,000. Lane was on a training run Friday when three teens chose him at random and shot him for "the fun of it," police said.The Associated Press contributed to this report	2013-08-22
1064	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/11/20/buckyballs-magnate-says-feds-took-him-down-for-speaking-out/	Buckyballs magnate says feds took him down for speaking out	Craig Zucker believes he had a "great American success story" until federal regulators shut him down for speaking up, and now the entrepreneur is fighting back.Scraping together $2,000 with a partner, Zucker in 2009 began importing small, high-powered magnets from China. Dubbed "Buckyballs," the BB-sized magnets could form all kinds of shapes and quickly became a hot seller. A year of trade shows, blog posts and word of mouth brought sales to $10 million, and Zucker projected more than doubling that by 2012. With his product in 1,500 stores, the 34-year-old Zucker was living his entrepreneurial dream.ADVERTISEMENT"It was the great American success story," Zucker recalled.- David Japha, a lawyer for Star Networks USA and Zen MagnetsBut then the complaints started coming in. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission warned that small children -- younger than the "14 and over" age group Zucker was targeting -- could swallow these powerful magnets, then pull them against their stomach walls with other Buckyballs. They were a danger, the agency declared. In fact, from 2009 to 2011, the CPSC says some 1,700 children have been hospitalized after ingesting Buckyballs or similar, high-powered magnets.Zucker says he worked vigorously with the agency and had five warning labels on the product. Maxfield & Oberton, Zuckers company, complied when the agency sought a recall in 2010, asking to adjust the warning label on the product. But in 2012, the agency sought a "stronger recall of the product.""Essentially, it was a declaration that we were going out of business," Zucker said.The commission was on the brink of outlawing products that it not only approved, but even helped create the warning labels for, Zucker told FoxNews.com. He said the CPSC was adamant about the product recall, asked stores to stop selling them and did not listen to any recommendations from Maxfield & Oberton to assuage the agencys safety concern. The agency filed an administrative lawsuit hours after receiving his companys recommendation, he said.With his million-dollar company belly-up for a product he still believes is safe, Zucker lashed out against what he considered government overreach. He took out online ads lampooning the nanny-state regulatory mentality."Coconuts: tasty fruit or deadly sky ballistic?" read one. "Stairways: are they really worth the risk?"He challenged commission officials to debates, and invited consumers to call CPSC Commissioner Inez Tenenbaums "psychic hotline" to find out how it was that "the vote to sue our company was presented to the Commissioners on July 23, a day before our Corrective Action Plan was to be submitted."Zuckers company was one of a dozen selling high-powered magnets that faced sanctions from the commission, but it was the only one of three named in the suit that voluntarily went out of business. And now, Zucker is the only individual being pursued personally for a financial judgment that could top $50 million to pay for the recall. Zucker believes it is because he taunted his regulatory tormentors."They are making it out to be a sin to talk about the government agency," said Zuckers lawyer, Reed Rubinstein, who is serving as counsel to Cause of Action. "There are no allegations here that he did anything wrong. He simply pushed back."Rubinstein filed a lawsuit on behalf of Zucker asking the U.S. District Court in Maryland to prevent the agency from seeking damages from Zuckers own bank account under the rarely used Park doctrine, which protects principals behind limited liability corporations. The attorney said the commissions decision to go after Zucker personally puts every entrepreneur at risk and threatens the limited liability for owners. Zucker is raising funds for his defense by selling "Liberty Balls."One commissioner agreed, though she was outvoted 3-1. Nancy Nord, the former interim commissioner of the CPSC who says she has a set of Buckyballs on her desk, wrote an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal and said the agency crossed the line between safety regulation and overreach in this case."Rather than work with Maxfield & Oberton to address the issue of children being injured by an adult product, the agency demanded an immediate recall," Nord writes. "When the company asked the agency to reconsider, the CPSC filed a lawsuit alleging that the product was defective because unintended users were misusing the product and suffering injuries. Instead of seeking an injunction against the sale of Buckyballs while the agency pursued its case, which the law allows, the agency approached retailers with an informal "request" that Buckyballs be removed from store shelves."CPSC spokesman Scott Wolfson said the agencys goal is to keep a dangerous product from children, not to punish companies. He said the agency had worked with Zuckers company in the past and was hoping to work with the company on new safety concerns. "The decision to file the lawsuit was not done in haste," Wolfson said. "Most times with recalls, companies will comply."Wolfson said it was Zuckers decision to dissolve the company. He said other high-powered magnet companies decided to either comply to the recall demand or face the lawsuit. Shihan Qu, the founder of Zen Magnets, which was also listed on the suit, called the CPSCs actions a "witch hunt" and an attempt for the agency to expand its powers. Qu finds himself in the unusual position of defending a competitor against a government agency."Whats the old saying? An enemy of an enemy is a friend," he said, pointing out that his company is still selling magnets during the legal process. "The agency is gambling to expand their power. This is how all power is gained. The CPSC is canceling our product on pre-evidence."David Japha, a lawyer for Star Networks USA and Zen Magnets, the two companies listed in the CPSC lawsuit, would not comment on Zuckers case, but he said the CPSC seems to simply "want a pound of flesh.""Everything you have in your house can be used for the wrong purpose," Japha said. "The purpose of a corporate entity is to protect the individual."	2013-11-20
1090	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/10/06/economist-holzhausen-sees-fear-loss-mistrust-markets-weighing-on-investors-for/	Economist Holzhausen sees fear of loss, mistrust of markets weighing on investors for years	NEW YORK –  Investors around the world have retreated from risk before. But this time is different.So says Arne Holzhausen, a senior economist at Allianz, an insurer based in Munich. He says whats keeping people from returning to taking chances with their money is not just a fear of loss, but a mistrust of the financial system. His prediction: Investors will remain cautious for several years to come.ADVERTISEMENTDepending on your view, Holzhausen is qualified either to understand this new cautious world, or to exaggerate its impact. A German, he shares with his countrymen a reluctance to gamble with money even in the best of times. He also has seen the damage when the appetite for risk swings from one extreme to the other: He lived and studied in Japan in 1989-1990 when overconfident investors pushed stock prices to a record, then in 1994-1995 after many had sold at a loss and the economy had entered a two-decade slump.In an interview, Holzhausen, 46, explained the psychological "scarring" that has kept people from buying stocks in the past five years, how living in Japan during its boom and bust shaped his views, why Germany is not the model economy widely assumed, and why he, like many Germans, has stayed away from stocks.Excerpts below have been edited for clarity and length:AP: Some economists talk about "scarring" from the financial crisis. What do they mean by that term?Holzhausen: If you have a bad experience in your young, formative years, you dont easily forget. In the beginning of the (last) decade, there was the tech bubble, then came the financial crisis. The generations in their 30s and 40s will keep cautious.Its not so much about value. People are deeply skeptical about the fairness of financial markets — heads the banks win, tails you lose.AP: People have been burned before, but they always come back. The 70s were terrible for investors, yet they ended up buying stocks the next decade, and borrowed more and spent.Holzhausen: After the oil shock of the 1970s, I dont think there was such mistrust. That was seen as an external shock. (Now) people think something is rotten in the financial system. People see financial markets as a casino.When I started (as an economist) in the 80s, the mood was you have to buy stocks. You heard it even in China, "To get rich is glorious." Now, people dont feel that anymore. People want to get as much distance as possible from the financial system. They want to be in control of their financial matters.AP: How much longer do you think households will continue to spend slowly, sell stocks and shun debt? Is it five years? Ten years?Holzhausen: Thats hard to predict, but look at the Japanese: They have not been in the mood (to spend and invest) for more than two decades. That might be an extreme case, but with low growth in the foreseeable future (in Europe) and a rapidly aging society, the revival of animal spirits is certainly not around the corner. Five years at least.AP: In the U.S., investors are starting to inch back into stocks. The Japanese stock market is up 45 percent in nine months. Some households there are buying again, too.Holzhausen: There is some movement on the margins. People are repositioning their portfolios to try to take advantage of recent equity booms. But overall, the stance is very cautious.AP: What about in Europe?Holzhausen: People in Europe are talking about a "great rotation" (back to stocks), but its still early. Is this really the return of the risky investor or is it a false dawn? Theres slow improvement. But the euro crisis is not yet over. People are still too fearful to get back into the markets. There is still a lot of angst. There is a lot of mistrust.AP: What have you done with your money?Holzhausen: I bought stocks back in the 90s, and lost a lot of money in the dot-com bubble and decided to get rid of them. Most of my money is in life insurance and in real estate.AP: You lived in Japan twice, in the late 80s when the real-estate and stock markets hit records, and in the mid-90s.Holzhausen: It was really eye opening, if you came from Europe. Asia was the future. It was more dynamic. It was richer. I couldnt afford anything. There really was exuberance, then there was pessimism. People dont believe in a better future, in a bright future, that Japan will return to high growth.AP: Germany is seen as a model for other countries. Unemployment is low, and Germans never borrowed too much. You have a different view of this.Holzhausen: Our performance looks good, but only in comparison to other European countries.Private investment is very low. Most companies are overly dependent on banks, and banks are reluctant to (lend). The market for equity and bonds for small and medium-size companies has not taken off. People are looking for safer assets. There is a lack of capital.We didnt pile on risk (before the financial crisis), so we avoided the slump. But looking forward, if Germany is the new normal you have to settle on much more meager results and performance in the long run.____You can reach Bernard Condon on Twitter at http://twitter.com/BernardFCondon.	2013-10-06
1237	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/02/24/where-beef-cow-shortage-forcing-industry-to-make-rough-cuts/	Wheres the beef? Cow shortage forcing industry to make rough cuts	WICHITA, Kan. –  Years of drought are reshaping the U.S. beef industry with feedlots and a major meatpacking plant closing because there are too few cattle left in the United States to support them.Some feedlots in the nations major cattle-producing states have already been dismantled, and others are sitting empty. Operators say they dont expect a recovery anytime soon, with high feed prices, much of the country still in drought and a long time needed to rebuild herds.ADVERTISEMENTThe closures are the latest ripple in the shockwave the drought sent through rural communities. Most cattle in the U.S. are sent to feedlots for final fattening before slaughter. The dwindling number of animals also is hurting meatpackers, with their much larger workforces. For consumers, the impact will be felt in grocery and restaurant bills as a smaller meat supply means higher prices.Owner Bob Podzemny has been taking apart the 32,000-head Union County Feed Yard near Clayton, N.M. It closed in 2009 when a bank shut off its operating capital in the midst of the financial crisis, and Podzemny said he doesnt see reopening after struggling through Chapter 11 bankruptcy."There just are not that many cattle in this part of the country no more, and it is not profitable to bring them in and feed them, so it is shut down," Podzemny said.Hes now feeding a few cattle in another feedlot, buying them at about 450 pounds and growing them to 800 to 850 pounds. He then sells them to others who bring them to the typical 1,200- to 1,300-pound slaughter weight."It is making a little money now on just growing feeders and selling them as feeders rather than finishing them all the way out," Podzemny said. "We do what we got to do to survive, you know."Cattle numbers have been falling for years as the price of corn used to feed animals in feedlots skyrocketed. The drought accelerated the process, but many feedlots were able to survive at first because ranchers whose pastures dried up weaned calves early and sent breeding cows to be fattened for slaughter.But now far fewer livestock than normal remain on the farms. And, ironically, if it rains this spring and summer, even fewer animals will go into feedlots because ranchers will hold back cows to breed and rebuild their herds.Texas, the largest beef-producing state, has been particularly hard hit with a historic drought in 2011 from which it still hasnt fully recovered."Most of the bad news is in Texas," said Dick Bretz, an Amarillo broker who specializes in selling feed yards and other agribusinesses. "That is where I see most of the empty yards, that is where I see most of the interest in selling yards and where I see the least interest in buying yards."He recently dismantled a 7,000-head feed yard in Hereford, Texas, for a new owner who had bought it for the land, not the business. The previous owner had lost the property to foreclosure, and the facility was in very poor condition and would have cost too much to repair, he said.When corn prices first spiked to $8 a bushel nearly four years ago, about 70 big feed yards went up for sale in the High Plains feeding area that includes Texas, Kansas, Colorado and Nebraska, Bretz said. Today, there are 10 and 15 feed yards for sale in the region, mostly in Texas. Bretz said he knows of 15 more that are empty, three recently dismantled and two others now being torn down.Feed yards typically employ one worker per 1,000 head of cattle, so even big ones may not have more than a few dozen workers. But they supply meatpacking plants, which have much bigger workforces, and feedlot closures could herald greater unemployment to come.Cargill Beef, one of the nations biggest meatpackers, temporarily closed a slaughterhouse in Plainview, Texas, earlier this year, laying off 2,000 workers. The operation had been one of four meatpacking plants in the Texas Panhandle, and the annual economic loss to the region is estimated at $1.1 billion -- a "major chunk of that economy," said Steve Amosson, an economist with the Texas AgriLife Extension Service in Amarillo.Cargill is moving what business remained at the plant to slaughterhouses in Friona, Texas; Dodge City, Kan.; and Ft. Morgan, Colo. That will allow those plants to run near capacity and more consistently give their workers full paychecks with 40 hours per week, spokesman Mike Martin said."By idling, we are retaining both the plant (in Plainview) and the property for potential future use," Martin added. "And the hope is that at some point some years down the line, the cattle herd will be rebuilt and there will be a need for additional processing capacity."Most experts estimate the cattle feeding industry now has an excess capacity of between 20 and 25 percent, CattleFax market analyst Kevin Good said. The meatpacking industry has an excess capacity of 10 to 15 percent -- even after the recent closure of Cargills Plainview plant.Given the cost of transporting cattle, most of the nations feed yards and slaughterhouses are in the big cattle-producing states of the High Plains. While the industry has been gradually shifting north from Texas into areas that are expected to more rapidly recover from the drought, businesses in Kansas and Nebraska are struggling too.In southwestern Kansas, Lakin Feed Yard manager Steve Landgraf said his operation is down to 75 percent of capacity and he expects it to be less than half full within the next couple of months. For every two animals now going out of his lot for slaughter, only one is coming into it.With a capacity of 15,000 head, the yard now employs 14 people. But with normal attrition, Landgraf anticipates hell be down to 10 or 11 workers by spring, and he may reduce their hours.Still, with little debt, Landgraf says hes in a better position than some."Some people are probably going to go broke because they arent going to have the occupancy," he said.	2013-02-24
1249	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/11/21/union-protest-at-los-angeles-airport-threatening-to-disrupt-holiday-travel/	Union protests at Los Angeles airport disrupt holiday travelers	LOS ANGELES –  A labor dispute at America’s third busiest airport turned what was already a bad travel day into a nightmare for some travelers.One of the nation’s biggest unions snarled traffic as it tried to block two entrances into the Los Angeles International airport Wednesday, in a protest police feared would turn the streets outside into a parking lot at a time when tens of thousands of cars are pouring into the airport.ADVERTISEMENTThe Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, claims a company that employs 450 sky caps, cabin cleaners and security workers at LAX illegally broke a contract and is in violation of the city’s living wage ordinance.That company, Aviation Safeguards, claims that’s inaccurate, saying 52 percent of its workers voted to decertify the SEIU. It also says employee pay has increased by more than $2 million since workers kicked the union out to compensate for changes in their health care policies.In protest, and with five additional LAX contracts expiring at the end of November, SEIU chose the busiest travel day of the year to bring attention to its cause. “We understand the inconvenience, but workers here are making the decisions of life," spokesman Ernesto Guerrero said.“Airport workers, they serve the public,” he told Fox News on Wednesday morning outside LAX Terminal 4. “They are very proud about their job. Unfortunately, they are being forced to do these extreme measures because otherwise no one is listening to them. The airport is not listening to them. The mayor of the city is not listening to them. We are being forced to take these extreme actions.”The protest began in the afternoon, and police arranged traffic diversions to keep travelers moving, even if roads were blocked. But some people ended up in backups and were delayed as they tried to make their flights, a police commander told the Associated Press.Airlines reported no major issues with passengers missing flights because of the protest, a LAX spokeswoman said. Thirteen people were arrested in the protest, including a dozen who sat down in the street and disobeyed a dispersal order, the Associated Press reports.The union planned to bus in roughly a 1,000 union members to march down Century Boulevard, the main entrance into LAX, and Sepulveda Boulevard, the entrance used by motorists coming north from the beach cities and Orange County. An estimated 1.7 million are expected to use LAX over the Thanksgiving holiday.While the unions action did bring attention to its cause, as dozens of local radio and TV vans converged on the airport to cover the event, it also could backfire, according to the company the union accuses of breaking a contract.“There is no dispute from our perspective. Our employees voted by a large majority to decertify from the SEIU,” Aviation Safeguard Vice President Joe Conlon said. “It is voluntary process to join a union. And it is voluntary process to not be part of a union. Our employees in a majority voted they did not want to be part of the SEIU anymore. So we don’t have a dispute. Our employees are happy with the wages and benefits they receive.” William La Jeunesse joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in March 1998 and currently serves as a Los Angeles-based correspondent.	2012-11-21

The entire process should take about a year.The snack makers demise was years in the making. Management missteps, rising labor costs and changing tastes culminated in a crippling strike by The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union.Hostess shut down its plants late last week after it said the strike by the bakery union hurt its ability to maintain normal production. The liquidation means the closure of 33 bakeries, 565 distribution centers, about 5,500 delivery routes and 570 bakery outlet stores, the company said.Management had said Hostess was already operating on razor-thin margins and that the strike was the final blow. The union, meanwhile, pointed to the steep raises executives were given last year, as the company was spiraling down toward bankruptcy."This is a very hostile situation and in some respects rightfully so," Rayburn said.A banker working for Hostess said at Wednesdays hearing that brands typically fetch the equivalent of about a years sales when they are sold off in liquidation. He noted Hostess sales are in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion a year.The banker, Joshua Scherer of Perella Weinberg Partners, said that interest in Hostess brands has come from companies ranging from regional bakers to major national retailers that have long sold Hostess products."This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get iconic brands separate from their legacy operators," Scherer said during the hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York in White Plains, N.Y.The companys initial announcement on Friday that it would move to liquidate its business prompted people across the U.S. to rush to stores and stock up on their favorite Hostess treats. Many businesses reported selling out of Twinkies within hours and the spongy yellow cakes turned up for sale online for hundreds of dollars.Hostess, founded in 1930, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January for the second time in less than a decade. Its predecessor company, Interstate Bakeries, sought bankruptcy protection in 2004 and changed its name to Hostess after emerging in 2009.A last-ditch effort to end a strike with Hostess bakers union failed Tuesday night and Judge Robert Drain on Wednesday approved the companys request to shut down its business and sell the pieces to the highest bidder.Hostess management told Drain that they needed to begin the liquidation process quickly to take advantage of a surge in outside interest in its brands, which in addition to its namesake include Natures Pride, Dolly Madison and Drakes.Hostess, based in Irving, Texas, also wanted to quickly shut down because it has been spending about $1 million a day in payroll without any income since it halted operations last week.The company will send out termination notices to its employees on Wednesday, said CEO Gregory Rayburn."Those employees now need to look for work," he said.Hostess said it plans to retain about 3,200 employees to help with the initial phase of the wind down.

Management missteps, rising labor costs and changing tastes culminated in a crippling strike by The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union.Hostess shut down its plants late last week after it said the strike by the bakery union hurt its ability to maintain normal production. The liquidation means the closure of 33 bakeries, 565 distribution centers, about 5,500 delivery routes and 570 bakery outlet stores, the company said.Management had said Hostess was already operating on razor-thin margins and that the strike was the final blow. The union, meanwhile, pointed to the steep raises executives were given last year, as the company was spiraling down toward bankruptcy."This is a very hostile situation and in some respects rightfully so," Rayburn said.A banker working for Hostess said at Wednesdays hearing that brands typically fetch the equivalent of about a years sales when they are sold off in liquidation. He noted Hostess sales are in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion a year.The banker, Joshua Scherer of Perella Weinberg Partners, said that interest in Hostess brands has come from companies ranging from regional bakers to major national retailers that have long sold Hostess products."This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get iconic brands separate from their legacy operators," Scherer said during the hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York in White Plains, N.Y.The companys initial announcement on Friday that it would move to liquidate its business prompted people across the U.S. to rush to stores and stock up on their favorite Hostess treats. Many businesses reported selling out of Twinkies within hours and the spongy yellow cakes turned up for sale online for hundreds of dollars.Hostess, founded in 1930, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January for the second time in less than a decade. Its predecessor company, Interstate Bakeries, sought bankruptcy protection in 2004 and changed its name to Hostess after emerging in 2009. 	2012-11-22

The fourth quarters total was the smallest in 14 years.ADVERTISEMENTThe current account is the countrys broadest measure of trade, covering not only goods and services but also investment flows. A wider deficit can act as a drag on growth because it means U.S. companies are earning less from their overseas markets.Rising petroleum exports have narrowed the gap in recent years, though such exports fell in the first quarter, widening the deficit.	2014-06-18

(TransCanada)A new study claims that a just-built 485-mile stretch of the Keystone XL pipeline has been a huge economic boon for two dozen rural and poor Oklahoma and Texas counties—and will create the same significant impact in five other states if the project’s long stalled northern segment ever wins White House approval.As the debate rages over the future of the $5 billion mega-project, a team of university researchers has released a report showing the economic benefits of Keystone’s Gulf Coast Pipeline, which just opened in January after 17 months of construction, linking Cushing, Okla., and Nederland, Tex. The study by the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University says the pipeline has pumped $3.6 billion into the Texas economy and $2.1 billion into the Oklahoma economy, while creating thousands of jobs directly and indirectly. It has also boosted tax revenues by millions of dollars, according to the study.ADVERTISEMENT“Similar state and local economic benefits can be anticipated should the United States give the go-ahead for construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from Hardisty, Albert, to Steele City, Neb.,” the report concluded.- Bernard Weinstein, author of Keystone studyTransCanda Corp. spent $2.3 billion to build the Gulf Coast Pipeline, which generated nearly 5,000 construction jobs. The firm spent $6 million each month, the study said.“Local restaurants, hotels, and businesses experience a significant boost thanks to the construction of the Gulf Coast Project,” the report said.The study’s author, Bernard Weinstein, told FoxNews.com the governments in the 24 counties the pipeline crosses collected more than $72 million in tax receipts as a result of the pipeline.“These are small rural counties, and they are also low-income counties, so this project was a real shot in the arm for them,” he said.The report was commissioned by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a proponent of the Keystone project. Members of the alliance include some of the world’s biggest energy firms, such as Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell Oil.“These are real numbers,” Michael Whatley, the group’s executive vice president, said in an interview with FoxNews.com. “What it shows is the construction of the southern half has been immensely helpful and the economic impacts in those counties are very real.”But a pipeline opponent from Nacogdoches County in East Texas wasn’t so sure the numbers were real.“This report feels inflated,” environmentalist Vicki Baggett of the group NAC STOP told FoxNews.com. “Our message is the tar sands pipeline poses a danger to the health and safety of our community, which I think is more important than any economic gain there might be for the county.”Alec Johnson, of Tar Sands Blockade, an environmental group based focused on the Gulf Coast, said oil companies are guilty of distort the purported economic benefits of their business, and said the study is an example of that. "It makes no mention of the fact that the fossil fuel industry spews 98 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every day, treating out vital public commons - the atmosphere - as an open sewer," Johnson said. "They pay nothing for that."Three phases of the Keystone Pipeline system have been completed. The fourth phase, which has caused the most controversy, needs President Obama’s approval because the project crosses Canada. In April, the White House said it was putting off a decision indefinitely. A decision is now not expected until after the mid-term elections in November. The project was announced in 2008.Supporters say Keystone will create jobs and increase energy independence. They also say it will reduce safety concerns because shipments of crude oil won’t have to be carried by rail. Opponents warn of possible spills and say production of the Canadian tar sands oil will contribute to global warning.Construction on the Gulf Coast Pipeline began in August 2012. The pipeline will have the initial capacity to transport 700,000 barrels of oil from day from underground storage tanks in Cushing to Gulf Coast refineries.   	2014-06-29

The two months followed a robust spending surge of 0.8 percent in March.

It was the biggest monthly increase since a $19.3 billion advance in February 2013.ADVERTISEMENTThe category that includes auto and student loans rose $16.4 billion while the category that covers credit card borrowing increased $1.1 billion.The overall increase in consumer debt pushed total borrowing to a record $3.14 trillion.Gains in borrowing are seen as an encouraging sign that people are more confident and willing to take on debt.Increased household borrowing can fuel higher consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.The rise in credit card borrowing in March followed a sizable decline of $2.7 billion in February and likely reflected the pickup in retail sales in March.The gain in borrowing for autos and student loans had also been expected given that auto sales posted a solid gain in March.Borrowing on credit cards plunged during the recession as consumers tried to lower their debt during a period when millions of people were losing their jobs and many people still working were worried about the threat of layoffs.Credit card borrowing started rising again in 2011 but the increases have lagged far behind the category that covers auto and student loans. Economists said that many households have become more cautious about taking on high-interest debt.Credit card debt in March was still 16.2 percent below its peak reached in July 2008. Credit card debt stood at $856.7 billion in March, up just 0.9 percent from a year ago.The measure of auto loans and student loans in March stood at $2.28 trillion, up 7.8 percent from a year ago. It has been up for 31 consecutive months going back to September 2011.A separate quarterly report on consumer credit done by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that student loan debt has been the biggest driver of borrowing since the recession officially ended in June 2009.Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin said last week that the large rise in student loan debt in recent years raised concerns about whether those participating in the program were getting the information they needed to avoid falling behind in their payments.She said at the end of last year there were more than 40 million recipients of student loans and approximately $1.1 trillion in student loan debt connected to federal student loan programs outstanding."Nearly 7 million Americans are now in default on a federal student loan," Raskin said in her first major speech since taking over the No. 2 job at Treasury. "We must ask the hard questions about why these borrowers were unable to enroll in loan modification programs ... with their federal student loan servicer to avoid default."The Feds borrowing report tracks credit card debt, auto loans and student loans but not mortgages or home equity loans.	2014-05-07

WASHINGTON –  Average U.S. rates on fixed mortgages fell this week for a fifth straight week. The spring home-buying season has started slowly, but it may be aided by the low rates.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the average rate for a 30-year loan edged down to 4.12 percent from 4.14 percent last week. The average for the 15-year mortgage declined to 3.21 percent from 3.25 percent.ADVERTISEMENTWarmer weather has yet to boost home-buying as it normally does. Rising prices and higher interest rates beginning in mid-2013 have made homes less affordable for would-be buyers. At the same time, a limited supply of homes is available to buy. New construction has focused increasingly on rental apartments, instead of single-family homes.Mortgage rates still are nearly a full percentage point above record lows reached about a year ago.U.S. home prices rose in March, data released Tuesday showed, but the gains are decelerating as fewer Americans can afford to buy.The Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 12.4 percent in March compared with 12 months earlier. While healthy, that rate of growth slowed from both February and January.And more Americans signed contracts to buy homes in April than in the prior month, but the pace of buying is still weaker than last year, according to data issued Thursday by the National Association of Realtors.The increase in mortgage rates over the past year or so was driven in part by speculation that the Federal Reserve would reduce its bond purchases, which have helped keep long-term interest rates low. Indeed, the Fed has announced four declines in its monthly bond purchases since December because the economy appears to be steadily healing. But the Fed has no plans to raise its benchmark short-term rate from record lows.Fed Chair Janet Yellen has told Congress that the economy is improving but noted that the job market remains "far from satisfactory" and that inflation is still below the Feds target rate. She said she expects the Feds near-zero target for short-term rates to remain appropriate for a "considerable time" after the bond purchases end.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged from a week earlier at 0.6 point. The fee for a 15-year loan also held steady, at 0.5 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate loan fell to 2.41 percent from 2.43 percent. The average fee remained at 0.4 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage was unchanged at 2.96 percent. The fee slipped to 0.3 point from 0.4 point.	2014-05-29

The Commerce Department issues its second of three estimates of how fast the U.S. economy grew in the July-September quarter of 2013 on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2013. Analyst forecast that third-quarter growth will be revised to a 3.1 percent annual rate, faster than the initial estimate of 2.8 percent. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  A fourth straight month of solid hiring in November could give the U.S. economy a jolt and signal that the job market may finally be gathering momentum.Economists are forecasting that employers added 180,000 jobs last month, according to a survey by FactSet. That would follow Octobers robust gain of 204,000. And it would keep the average monthly gain for the past four months at around 200,000.ADVERTISEMENTThe unemployment rate is expected to fall back to 7.2 percent from 7.3 percent. That would match a five-year low reached in September. Still, the rate remains above historically healthy levels of between 5 percent and 6 percent.The Labor Department will release the November jobs report at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time Friday.More jobs would follow other encouraging data reported in the midst of the crucial holiday shopping season. Growth is accelerating, corporate profits are rising and companies are laying off the fewest workers in six years."The momentum looks strong," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at the Bank or Tokyo-Mitsubishi.Hopes for a robust finish to 2013 still hinge on strong hiring. The recovery from the Great Recession that ended 4½ years ago has come in fits and starts. Growth has yet to reach the acceleration that defined U.S. economic recoveries for much of the past half century.Even Thursdays government report that the economy grew at a robust annual rate of 3.6 percent from July through September was hardly cause for celebration.Nearly half the growth came from businesses building up their stockpiles, a temporary factor. Excluding stockpiling, annual growth last quarter was a mere 1.9 percent.Unless consumers step up spending during the holiday season, stockpiling is likely to slow.Most economists foresee a sharp slowdown in growth during the October-December quarter as businesses do less stockpiling. Early estimates for economic growth are at or below an annual rate of 1.5 percent.Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, cautioned that a drop in fourth-quarter growth might not necessarily signal a weakening economy. Ashworth noted that the report on third-quarter growth showed that business sales surged, corporate profits rose, income grew and Americans saved more.Still, the economy needs more jobs to sustain its strength. The economy has added a solid average of 202,000 jobs a month from August through October. And the number of people applying for unemployment benefits has fallen over the past month back to mid-2007 levels. That signals fewer layoffs and further job gains in November.Job growth has a dominant influence over much of the economy. If hiring continues at the current pace, a virtuous cycle starts to build. More jobs usually lead to higher wages, more spending and faster growth.Stronger corporate profits this year might also enable the creation of higher-paying jobs. More than half the jobs that have been added in the past six months have come from four low-wage industries: retail; hotels, restaurants and entertainment; temp jobs; and home health care workers.The Federal Reserve has pegged its stimulus efforts to the unemployment rate. Chairman Ben Bernanke has said the Fed will ease its monthly purchases of $85 billion in bonds once hiring has improved consistently.The recent economic upturn has been surprising. Many economists expected the government shutdown in October to hobble growth. Yet the economy motored along without much interruption, according to several government and industry reports.Early reports on holiday shopping have been disappointing. The National Retail Federation said sales during the Thanksgiving weekend — probably the most important stretch for retailers — fell for the first time since the group began keeping track in 2006.But those estimates exclude autos, home sales and movies, three major consumer categories. Auto sold in November at their best pace in seven years, according to Autodata Corp. New-home sales in October bounced back from a summer downturn.Stuart Hoffman, chief economist for PNC Bank, downplayed concerns that holiday sales might be sluggish. "Consumers, once again, their demise has been greatly exaggerated," he said.	2013-12-06

Lean-hog futures rose to a seven-week high a week ago and are up 6% since mid-December.ADVERTISEMENTPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus, or the PED virus, appeared in the U.S. for the first time in April and has killed thousands of piglets since then. The virus, which causes severe diarrhea and vomiting, is fatal only to young pigs and poses no threat to human health or food safety, according to swine veterinarians. The U.S. strain is nearly identical to a version that curbed hog production in China in 2012.The extent of the impact is unclear because farms dont have to report incidents or death totals to federal regulators. Smithfield Foods Inc., the worlds largest pork producer, and other meatpackers estimate that about 10% of the nations sows, or adult female hogs, have been infected by the virus, which can spread to their offspring.Smithfield, a unit of Chinas Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd., said last month the virus could result in a loss to U.S. pig production this year of two million to three million head, or up to 3% of the industrys total. Hormel Foods Corp., the maker of Spam, warned recently its earnings for fiscal 2014 could be affected by "potentially volatile hog costs" due to the virus.To ward off the disease, many U.S. hog farmers are redoubling safety practices, including disinfecting equipment and workers footwear. But many say they find it difficult to prevent."This is the toughest disease weve ever gone through," said Mike Brandherm, a general manager with Hitch Pork Producers, a Guymon, Okla., livestock producer that lost 30,000 piglets in six weeks in a 2013 outbreak. "It was stunning how fast the disease spread. You feel helpless."Click for more from The Wall Street Journal.	2014-01-11

The Labor Department releases weekly jobless claims, on Thursday, Jan. 23, 2014. (AP Photo/LM Otero)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits ticked up 1,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 326,000, a level consistent with steady job gains.The Labor Department says the four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell for the third straight week to 331,500. Both figures are close to pre-recession levels and suggest that companies are laying off few workers.ADVERTISEMENTOne sour note in the report: Nearly 1.4 million people who have been unemployed longer than six months lost benefits in the week that ended Jan. 4, the latest period for which figures are available. Thats because an emergency program that provided extended benefits expired Dec. 28.The number of recipients fell to 3.7 million from 4.7 million in the previous week. About 300,000 people began receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Jan. 4.The total number of beneficiaries was already falling steadily even before the cutoff: More than 5.6 million people were receiving aid a year ago.President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats pushed to extend the emergency program for another three months. But they couldnt reach agreement with Republicans, who wanted to cut spending to offset the $6 billion estimated cost. The extended benefits had been available since 2008.The program provided up to 47 extra weeks of aid, paid for by the federal government. It offered payments averaging $256 a week to people who had exhausted their state benefits, which typically last for six months.Economists predict that the expired benefits will cause the unemployment rate to fall by as much as a quarter of percentage point in early 2014. The decrease will likely happen because many of the former recipients will give up on their job searches, which are required in order to receive benefits.As a result, they will no longer be counted as unemployed. The government counts people as unemployed only if they are looking for work.The unemployment rate fell last month to 6.7 percent from 7 percent. Much that decrease came from 347,000 unemployed workers leaving the workforce. A mere 74,000 jobs were created in December, after average monthly gains of 214,000 new jobs in the previous four months.There are signs that economic growth is accelerating. Consumer confidence and retail spending have picked up in the October-December quarter. Orders to U.S. manufacturers rose in November, a sign that businesses are investing more on factory-made items such as machinery, computers and electrical goods. Factory output rose for a fifth straight month in December.The economy is still far from healthy. Income rose at a slower pace than spending last month, which means Americans are spending more but saving less. And sales of existing homes have dropped for three straight months, held back by higher prices and mortgage rates.Still, many economists have become more optimistic about the October-December quarter. Several are predicting a solid annual growth rate of 3 percent or more. Thats up from estimates a month ago of as low as 1.5 percent.	2014-01-23
726	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/29/judge-backs-bankrupt-coal-producer-in-benefits-dispute-with-union/	Judge backs bankrupt coal producer in benefits dispute with union	ST. LOUIS –  A bankrupt coal producer got a judges go-ahead Wednesday to significantly cut health care and pension benefits to thousands of workers and retirees, claiming victory over a miners union that swiftly condemned the ruling it pledges to appeal.U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kathy Surratt-States 102-page ruling favoring St. Louis-based Patriot Coal dashed the nations biggest coal miners unions hopes of scuttling the companys quest to impose wage and benefit cuts by walking away from its collective-bargaining agreements.ADVERTISEMENTSurratt-States ultimately concluded the cost-cutting proposals were legal, perhaps unavoidable, for Patriot, which sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last summer to address labor obligations it insisted have grown unsustainable."Unions generally try to bargain for the best deal for their members," the judge wrote. "However, there is likely some responsibility to be absorbed for demanding benefits that the employer cannot realistically fund in perpetuity, particularly given the availability of sophisticated actuarial analysts and cost trend experts."The union, through its attorney during a recent weeklong St. Louis hearing over Patriots cost-cutting, had threatened a strike if Surratt-States decision didnt go organized labors way. The union steered clear Wednesday of walkout talk, saying it would continue arguing during protests that Patriot was set up to fail when spun off. The union said that negotiations would continue and that it would appeal Surratt-States ruling."We have long acknowledged that Patriot is in trouble," Cecil Roberts, the unions president, said in a statement. "We remain willing to take painful steps to help Patriot get through the rough period it faces over the next couple of years. But if were going to share in that pain, then we have every right to share in the companys gain when it becomes profitable again.""As often happens under American bankruptcy law," Roberts added, "the short-term interests of the company are valued more than the dedication and sacrifice of the workers, who actually produce the profits that make a company successful."Patriots proposed cuts have been the most contentious aspect since the Peabody Energy Corp. spinoff filed for bankruptcy. The company said it would have to spend $1.6 billion to cover the health care costs, putting it at risk of liquidation.Bennett Hatfield, Patriots president and CEO, called the ruling "a major step forward" for the company. But he said bargaining with the union would press on, insisting "we continue to believe that a consensual resolution is the best possible outcome for all parties."While looking to cease pension contributions, Patriot has proposed creating a trust with up to $300 million from future profit-sharing to fund some level of health benefits. Patriot also would give the union a 35 percent equity stake in the company once it emerges from bankruptcy.Prospects of a walkout would mirror the labor dispute involving the bankruptcy of Hostess Brands Inc. The Irving, Texas-based maker of Wonder Bread, Twinkies and other baked goods last year filed for Chapter 11 protection and later announced it was going out of business and liquidating after a nationwide strike by its bakers union crippled operations.In Patriots case, Hatfield has called the moves necessary for the coal companys survival and the preservation of more than 4,000 jobs, the bulk of them in Kentucky and West Virginia.During first three months of this year, the company reported a net loss of $115.9 million, compared with a loss of $75.3 million over the same time last year.Union leaders contend Patriot was saddled with unsustainable pension and long-term health care obligations when Peabody jettisoned it as a separate company in 2007, essentially setting it up to fail.Peabody disputes that. It has said Patriot "was highly successful following its launch more than five years ago" but caught up in the industry undertow that affected all coal producers, including a global financial crisis, development of low-cost shale gas that cut demand for coal and burdensome federal regulation.Wednesdays ruling did nothing to resolve that debate."Was Debtor Patriot Coal Corp. created to fail? Maybe not. Maybe," the judge wrote. "Maybe the executive team involved at (Patriots) inception thought the liabilities were manageable and thus the reality of Debtors bankruptcy was more attributed to unwarranted optimism about future prospects.""The legacy of unfunded retiree medical benefits," she added, "was itself the result of Congressional inaction, a changing manufacturing landscape, and the benign neglect and false hopes of companies and unions alike."	2013-05-29
753	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/09/04/despite-veto-override-mccrory-says-wont-carry-out-welfare-drug-testing/	Despite veto override, McCrory says he wont carry out welfare drug testing	RALEIGH, N.C. –  Tasting the defeat of overrides on his first two vetoes, a defiant Gov. Pat McCrory said Wednesday that he still wont implement one of the bills the General Assembly passed because lawmakers didnt give him enough money to do so.Barely an hour after the Senate completed the overrides first started by the House late Tuesday, McCrory used a State Board of Education meeting to criticize fellow Republicans for passing a bill requiring drug-testing for certain welfare recipients.ADVERTISEMENTLegislators set aside $145,000 in the state budget to carry out the drug-testing law. But McCrorys health and human services agency said the law required an additional $300,000 to make computer changes, not including expenses incurred by all 100 counties."The executive branch will not take any action on the new laws implementation until sufficient funds with this unfunded mandate are provided," the governor said in a statement.Legislative leaders were taken aback by McCrorys announcement and wondered aloud how he could avoid carrying out a new law that was approved in July and whose veto was overridden by wide margins. The drug testing of Work First applicants and recipients wouldnt begin until next summer."It seems like a little instrument called the state constitution has been forgotten, and the powers of the three branches of government," Sen. Tom Apodaca, R-Henderson, the Senate Rules Committee chairman, told reporters. The North Carolina constitution says the governor "shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.""All governors, without regard to party, swear an oath to uphold the constitution," Senate leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, said in a statement. "We expect Gov. McCrory to perform his constitutional duty to enforce the law."Senate Minority Leader Martin Nesbitt, D-Buncombe, added the governor is "trying to pass the blame for the budget he signed and put himself above the law."It took senators less than 10 minutes of floor debate to override the drug-testing veto and the veto of another bill that allows employers to create a new definition of a temporary worker that could help them avoid participating in the federal E-Verify program, a system that electronically verifies workers legal status.McCrory claimed the second veto override would create a loophole that would allow all sorts of industries — not just the agricultural interests that had sought the change — to hire immigrants who are in the country illegally.The governor said he would "explore all legal and executive authority to ensure that the letter and spirit of our nations immigration law is followed."Potentially setting up a new confrontation with lawmakers, the governor also blamed Republican legislative leaders for putting too much education policy into the state budget bill, which he signed into law, rather than dealing with it in separate legislation.One such provision will prevent teachers from receiving salary increases for completing an advanced degree starting in the 2014-15 school year if they werent paid at the higher level before then. McCrory said the provision would mean many teachers getting advanced degrees wont obtain additional pay because they wont finish before next spring."I dont think thats fair," the governor told the education board. The supplement equates to a 10 percent increase for a masters degree and another $253 per month for teachers with doctoral degrees.McCrory said his state budget office had located money — an investment of more than $10 million — so that all of the more than 3,000 teachers currently seeking advanced degrees will get the salary bump even if they dont finish before the next spring. The governor plans to propose the spending in next years budget, spokeswoman Kim Genardo said late Wednesday.Apodaca said legislators worked hard to try to find the right balance between ending the advanced pay supplement and giving teachers the time to complete their degree and still qualify for higher pay."We didnt hear any suggestions at that time (from McCrory) on how we could do it," he said.McCrory said he wants to talk more with legislators about whether ending the advanced-degree salary policy is sound. Eric Guckian, the governors senior education adviser, said there is conflicting evidence about whether student outcomes improve when a teacher gets a masters degree. But McCrory is responding to feedback from teachers about the end of higher pay for advanced degrees, Guckian said.Teachers are "feeling insulted by this ... pay issue and theyre feeling disrespected, and we honor and respect our teachers," he said. McCrory asked board members to vote Thursday for a policy change that will help teachers earning advanced degrees by this spring qualify for the higher pay.House Speaker Thom Tillis, R-Mecklenburg, didnt comment on McCrorys plans Wednesday. Two key House Republicans said last week they didnt mean to cut off pay for teachers already enrolled in graduate school.The motion to override the veto of the drug-test bill passed 34-10. The motion to cancel the veto on changes to how a temporary employee is defined was approved 39-5.Barring the call of a special session, the General Assembly isnt expected to reconvene until next May.	2013-09-04

(AP)Walmart employees began walking off the job this week in advance of Black Friday, when three-union backed groups expect thousands of protests nationwide.In October, a strike at a Walmart in Los Angeles spread to stores in 12 other cities, with local and national leaders holding protests at more than 200 stores for better pay, fairer schedules and more affordable health care. Since that time, workers have since walked off the job in Dallas and Richmond, Calif., and other upcoming strikes and protests are expected at stores in Chicago, Miami, Milwaukee and Washington, D.C.ADVERTISEMENTCharlene Fletcher, who works with her husband William at a Walmart in Duarte, Calif., became enraged when she learned that both were scheduled to work on Thanksgiving, missing the holiday with their children, ages 2 and 5.“It’s heartbreaking to miss the holiday with them, and it’s just one more way that Walmart is showing its disregard for our families,” Fletcher said in a statement. “But when our co-workers speak out about problems like these, Walmart turns their schedules upside down, cuts their hours and even fires people. We’re going on strike for an end to Walmart’s attempts to silence its workers.”Three groups — Making Change at Walmart, OUR Walmart and watchdog group Corporate Action Network — are now calling on the nation’s largest employer to end what they claim are retaliatory tactics against employees who seek out better working conditions.In a statement to FoxNews.com, Walmart spokesman Dan Fogleman characterized the movement as "another exaggerated publicity campaign aimed at generating headlines to mislead" customers and employees."We have a great group of associates at Walmart," the statement read. "We’ll have more than one million associates working throughout the holiday weekend and they’re excited about our Black Friday plans this year. This is the Super Bowl for retailers and we’re ready."We’ve been working on our Black Friday plans for almost a year now and we’re prepared to have a great event. Our associates care about providing a great customer experience on Black Friday and we’re confident that’s what customers will have at Walmart this year."Protests were held Thursday at Walmart stores in Eastvale and in Mira Loma, where six people were arrested for blocking traffic, KTLA reports.Many customers, however, told KTLA they weren’t so convinced by the workers’ plans."If you come into a workplace knowing thats an agreement you might have to make, then thats your choice to have that job," shopper Rae Luce told the station.	2012-11-16
886	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/01/24/manufacturing-companies-using-technology-since-recession-to-replace-white/	Manufacturing companies using technology since recession to replace white-collar workers, too	NEW YORK –  Manufacturers have been using technology to cut blue-collar jobs for years. Now, theyre targeting their white-collar workers, too.Factory Automation Systems makes machines that help companies cut, bundle and load products faster and cheaper than humans can. But it didnt realize how much technology could help its own business until the Great Recession hit.ADVERTISEMENTTo save money, the Atlanta company cut nine workers doing administrative tasks, like booking flights, answering phones, managing employee benefits and ordering parts and supplies."I had to lay people off to survive, then I noticed its not such a big deal" to do things myself, President Rosser Pryor says. "When Im buying something, I can go online. I dont need a buyer."Pryor says do-it-yourself software means he doesnt have to rehire though business has rebounded.Other manufacturers are using technology to avoid hiring blue-collar workers when business improves.Stripmatic Products, a Cleveland auto supplier, used technology to eliminate more blue-collar jobs. Stripmatic used to assign a worker to each of its stamping machines pounding out metal tubular car parts. They would look for jams inside the machines that cause costly shutdowns, called "smashups."Then the recession struck, and Stripmatic had to cut staff and scramble to make do with less. To monitor the machines, it turned to electronic sensors and got surprisingly good results. Smashups happen only once or twice a year now, instead of four per month before, and the presses are running 2-3 times faster."With a human, youre going to get distracted, youre going to feel the monotony of (the work)," Stripmatic President Bill Adler says. "Youre not going to be 100 percent successful."Stripmatic is doing 20 percent more business than before the recession, with a third fewer employees.Factory Automation and Stripmatic cut just a handful of jobs each. But multiply those over many companies in many industries in many countries and it helps explain why so many in the middle class cant find work.___Paul Wiseman reported from Washington.

960	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/02/23/gulf-coast-set-for-bakken-like-boom-with-liquefied-natural-gas/	Gulf Coast set for Bakken-like boom with liquefied natural gas	The energy boom that has North Dakota boasting the country’s lowest unemployment rate — and skyrocketing real estate prices — could soon do the same for the Gulf Coast.Dozens of facilities are set to sprout up along the Louisiana and Texas coasts to liquefy natural gas from shale formations as far away as Pennsylvania and Ohio for export around the world. The energy boom, which is turning the U.S. into a net exporter, could drive liquefaction capacity to an eight-fold increase in the next five years alone, experts say. That could mean hundreds of thousands of new jobs along the Gulf Coast, by some estimates.ADVERTISEMENT"From an economic development standpoint, it is going to be huge," said Ragan Dickens, spokesman for the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association. "It is incredibly exciting to know the region will see this influx of new jobs."More than 110 liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities now operate in the U.S., some exporting the super-cooled liquid, while others turn natural gas into an energy form that occupies up to 600 times less space than natural gas for vehicle fuel or industrial use. Worldwide, LNG trade is expected to more than double by 2040, according to the Energy Information Administration.- Chip Knappenberger, Center for the Study of Science at the Cato InstituteUp to a dozen long-term deals, each worth billions of dollars, have been signed by American natural gas producers with companies in China, Japan, Taiwan, Spain, France and Chile, according to Reuters. The federal Energy Department has authorized companies to export up to 8.5 billion cubic feet per day of liquefied natural gas, about 13 percent of current daily production. Given the entrenched oil and gas industry, access to shipping and regional resources, the Gulf Coast is set to become the epicenter of the coming liquefaction boom.One market research firm, Industrial Info Resources, predicts $64 billion will be spent to build at least seven LNG facilities on the Gulf Coast in coming years. The massive-scale construction could even strain the skilled labor force, according to IIR Executive Vice President Michael Bergen.But other experts said demand for skilled workers to fill high-paying jobs is a problem the region can handle — happily.“A lot can (and will) happen in five years,” Michael Quinn, managing principal at the Analysis Group, told FoxNews.com in an email. “That’s plenty of time both for workers with various skillsets to be trained or to relocate to where the jobs are. It’s also plenty of time for market conditions regarding the sale of LNG to change such that eight-fold growth wouldn’t be economic.”Another estimate predicts that the region between Brownsville, Texas, and Pascagoula, Mississippi, could see labor demand surge from 86.1 million required man-hours in 2013 to 134.3 million in 2015, or an increase of more than 55 percent. In just two years, the number of pipe fitters, welders, electricians and other skilled workers in the Gulf Coast will grow from roughly 62,000 to more than 103,000, driven in part by receipt and export terminals now under development by companies like Sempra Energy in Louisiana and Freeport LNG in Texas.Labor leaders say the region could face a "dramatic shortage" of skilled hands, especially in the Gulf Coast. To combat that, Eric Dean, general secretary of Iron Workers International, said the 120,000-member union is ramping up its training regimen."We have 150 training facilities with a maximum capacity to train over 50,000 highly skilled ironworkers," Dean told FoxNews.com in an email. "Our training consists of 3-4 year apprenticeship programs which lead to a safe, highly skilled, trades person. We have increased staffing of these facilities as well as recruitment efforts targeting skilled and semiskilled workers that we can train and, where necessary, upgrade their skills."Increasing the pool of certified welders — currently numbering more than 10,000 within the trade association — has been an ongoing challenge for the union, due in part to a large number of retiring workers and the economic downturn, Dean said.But the prospect of a jobs bonanza is not enough to quell the misgivings of some environmental groups and advocates who believe the region could be rushing too fast into the LNG boom.Tim Riley, an attorney who produced and directed "The Risks and Danger of LNG," told FoxNews.com that LNG facilities will ultimately lead to increased risk of danger to nearby communities, send domestic gas prices surging nationwide and vastly increase the amount of methane in the atmosphere.“The main gripe is that proponents of LNG boast that it is clean natural gas," Riley told FoxNews.com. "However, its processed natural gas that by the time it goes through it complete cycle of extraction to liquefaction to transport to gasification to piping … that whole industrial process uses more energy than it would to just burn natural gas."Chip Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at Cato Institute, said there’s no question that the pending projects will be a boost for jobs in the region. One challenge will be making sure strain on the labor pool doesnt slow down the boom.“My gut feeling is that in an economy where people are looking for jobs, with the availability of new jobs coming on, regardless of the technical aspect, you’re going to find someone to eagerly fulfill them to the best of their abilities,” Knappenberger told FoxNews.com. “Will it slow down the initial burst of liquefied natural gas facilities? Maybe, but I think people are working hard to make sure that’s not the case.”In fact, labor-related costs and environmental opposition to the projects, could prove to be more of a challenge than finding skilled laborers to build LNG facilities, Knappenberger said.“If that resource is there, I can’t imagine that it’s going to go unfulfilled,” he said. “As long as they permitting these things, they’re going to keep building them out.”As North Dakota has learned, a dizzying economic boom like the Gulf Coast faces with liquefaction can bring headaches. Real estate in the Peace Garden State, which now produces more oil than any state other than Texas, has exploded. A 700-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment in Williston, N.D., can easily cost more than $2,000 per month, while a three-bedroom place could fetch as much as $4,500, according to ApartmentGuide.com.“You’ve got places up there with the most expensive rates in the country, so people are flocking there,” Knappenberger said. “Job seekers are coming, it’s just stressing the infrastructure. That might happen down in the Gulf Coast, maybe it won’t. But I think you’ll have droves of people looking for jobs if they’re available. Where did all the people in the Bakken region come from? They weren’t local folks.”	2014-02-23

The action does not involve any criminal allegations.S&P denies any wrongdoing and says any lawsuit would be without merit.A lawsuit would "disregard" the fact that S&P reviewed the same data on risky mortgages as the rest of the market and U.S. government officials, who publicly said in 2007 that the problems in the subprime mortgage market appeared to be limited, the company said in a statement.In the statement, S&P said it "deeply regrets" that its ratings on some securities "failed to fully anticipate the rapidly deteriorating conditions in the U.S. mortgage market during that tumultuous time."Justice Department spokeswoman Nanda Chitre declined to comment on the matter.S&P is a unit of New York-based McGraw-Hill Cos. McGraw-Hills stock plunged nearly 14 percent Monday after reports surfaced about the governments expected lawsuit.Moodys Corp., the parent of Moodys Investors Service, another rating agency, closed down nearly 11 percent. The two rating companies stocks suffered the biggest percentage drops in the S&P 500 index, which closed down slightly more than 1 percent.S&P, Moodys, and Fitch Ratings, the third major rating agency, have been blamed for helping fuel the crisis by assigning AAA ratings to trillions of dollars in risky securities backed by subprime mortgages. The securities later collapsed in value once the housing market bubble burst and home-loan delinquencies soared. Major U.S. banks absorbed tens of billions of dollars in losses.The rating agencies are crucial arbiters of the creditworthiness of securities traded around the world. The grades they assign can affect a companys ability to raise or borrow money and how much investors will pay for securities it issues.The securities in the anticipated federal lawsuit are collateralized debt offerings. CDOs are investment vehicles that contain many underlying mortgage loans.A CDO generally gains in value if borrowers repay. But a wave of defaults can cause them to tumble in value. Soured CDOs contributed to, and intensified, the financial crisis.Critics have long argued that rating agencies have an inherent conflict of interest: Theyre paid by the same companies whose products and credit they rate. The agencies have been accused of issuing unduly high ratings before the crisis because of pressure from banks they desired as clients.	2013-02-04
1016	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/02/08/ny-attorney-general-looking-into-ratings-agencies-compliance-under-old/	NY attorney general looking into ratings agencies compliance under old agreement	ALBANY, N.Y. –  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has begun examining the nations biggest credit rating agencies compliance with agreements reached by his predecessor, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, that ended an investigation into mortgage-backed securities.The mid-2008 agreements, imposing no financial penalties, required Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Inc. to publicly disclose due diligence and evaluation criteria. They also required partial upfront payments to prevent banks from simply buying the better ratings for those securities.ADVERTISEMENTWith that market already collapsed, the agencies say they werent rating new mortgage-backed securities. The 42-month agreements have expired.An official with knowledge of the investigation, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said a subpoena this week went to S&P and information requests to Moodys and Fitch. Under the agreement, then-Attorney General Cuomo agreed to "terminate all current investigation" and "not institute any action" against the agencies. They admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to cooperate with the attorney generals ongoing probe into the mortgage industry and adopt reforms.The official noted there appeared to be little effort to monitor compliance and they are looking into whether violations would enable the office now to take another look at alleged misconduct in securities ratings that contributed to the collapse of financial markets.S&P spokesman Edward Sweeney and Fitchs Daniel Noonan declined comment Friday.At an earnings conference call Friday, when asked about the New York probe, Moodys chief executive Raymond McDaniel said that the company from time to time gets requests for information from parties that include state attorneys general and that they cooperate with them.Fitch did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The U.S. Justice Department this week filed civil charges against S&P, accusing the rating agency of refusing to warn investors that the housing market was collapsing in 2006 because it would be bad for business. The department is seeking $5 billion in penalties.S&P, a unit of New York-based McGraw-Hill Cos., called the lawsuit meritless and said, "Claims that we deliberately kept ratings high when we knew they should be lower are simply not true."The federal Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in concluded in its final report two years ago that the 2007-2008 market upheaval, followed by national recession, came from a decade of "pervasive permissiveness" by regulators with expanding debt and high-risk behavior by home buyers and owners, mortgage lenders, investors and financial institutions that repackaged and resold that debt.Its root was mortgages issued to people who could not afford them. The three ratings agencies, paid from $250,000 to $500,000 to grade each collateralized debt obligation, "were essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction," the report said.That secondary market was rocked as the housing boom ended, more borrowers defaulted and thousands of AAA-rated securities based on those debt obligations tumbled.____AP Business Writer Bree Fowler in New York contributed to this report.	2013-02-08

However, since Tennessee is one of 24 so-called "Right to Work" states, plant employees dont have to sign up or contribute dues.ADVERTISEMENTNow, some eight workers at the plant, which employs about 1,600, say they thought they were simply agreeing to have a secret vote on bringing in the union, when in fact, they were signing cards professing their support for it. The workers also say that when they objected, they were told they had to go to the local union hall in order to reclaim the cards. The National Right to Work Foundation filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board.“There’s been a long history of bad actions in pushing workers into the union,” Patrick Semmens, vice president of legal information for the NRTW foundation, told FoxNews.com. “These workers were told that it was a secret ballot vote. They were being forced into the union illegally.”In the complaint, Semmens group alleges the UAW solicited workers signatures on ‘authorization cards’ through unlawful means including, “misrepresentations, coercion, threats, and promises.” The group also charged the UAW "misrepresented to employees the purpose for signing the cards."Officials for the UAW ignored repeated requests for comment from FoxNews.com, but in previous reports stated that a majority of the plant’s workers have signed union cards expressing interest in the union.UAW officials also called the allegations in the complaint “frivolous and baseless” and an effort to delay talks between the union and Volkswagen.“We don’t think it is frivolous,” Semmens said. “There’s a long history of bad actions in pushing workers into the union.The Chatanooga VW plant has proven to be a vital proving ground for the UAW, as a successful organizing push could make it easier for the union to gain support at other plants such as the Nissan assembly plant in Canton, Miss., and a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama. Both are Right-to-Work states.The UAW has been sent packing in efforts to organize at South Korean and Japanese-owned plants in the U.S., but believes a labor deal can be struck with Volkswagen. In Germany, Volkswagen workers are represented by the IG Metall union, which, with more than 2 million members, is six times the size of the UAW, and which actually holds seats on Volkswagens supervisory board.If Volkswagen agrees, and a majority of plant workers indicate they support being unionized, the UAW can come in without going through a formal vote. But it is not clear if Volkswagens is willing to support the UAWs push for recognition in Chattanooga without a formal vote among the workers, according to Reuters. 	2013-09-27

After Detroit filed for bankruptcy July 18, Motor City property has been a hot topic on China’s social media platform, Weibo, according to a Quartz.com report.ADVERTISEMENTNews of the bankruptcy, coupled with a Chinese TV report in March that claimed you could buy two houses in Detroit for the same price as a pair of leather shoes, has piqued investors interest.   Quartz spoke to Caroline Chen, a real estate broker based in Troy, Mich., who says she has received “tons of calls” from mainland Chinese expressing serious interest in the market.“I have people calling and saying, ‘I’m serious -- I wanna buy 100, 200 properties,’” Chen said. She added that a colleague had recently sold 30 properties to a single Chinese buyer.Chinese housing is among the most expensive in the world. Capital controls also make investing big sums in overseas stocks or property a challenge.  Buyers seem to be purchasing purely as investment, and don’t plan on moving to Detroit anytime soon.  Though Chinese realtors had planned tours of the city in late spring, many were canceled when investors didn’t receive visas, according to Chen.Since there are no plans to live in the homes, shopping remotely from China is not a problem. “They say, ‘We don’t need to see them [the properties], just pick the good ones,’” Chen said.This may be only the beginning of a buying trend. Wei Kefei, an organizer of a Beijing property fair, told state-run Global Times that Chinese were investing now and expecting Detroits economy to come back, helped by the city’s auto industry. “Some people did rush to buy houses in Detroit, betting on the U.S. economic recovery, which they believe will boost development in the auto industry,” Wei told Quartz.The buying craze was so significant that China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned citizens about the risks of investing, and the many hidden costs that buyers take on when they purchase U.S. real estate.Chen doesn’t seem as convinced as the Chinese of the Motor City’s recovery. She compared the chances of the city’s housing market turning a profit to winning the lottery. “Thirty-five years ago downtown Detroit was like this and it’s not getting better.”Click for more from Quartz.com.	2013-07-29

The number of Americans seeking unemployment aid fell to a five-year low last week, a hopeful sign the job market is healing. But much of the decline reflects seasonal volatility in the data. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  The number of Americans seeking unemployment aid plummeted to a five-year low last week, a hopeful sign the job market may be improving. But much of the decline reflects seasonal volatility in the data.Weekly unemployment benefit applications fell 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 335,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. Thats the lowest level since January 2008, just after the recession began.ADVERTISEMENTThe four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell to 359,250.The applications data can be uneven in January. Job cuts typically spike in the second week of the month as retailers, restaurants and other companies lay off temporary workers hired for the winter holidays.The department seasonally adjusts the numbers to account for such trends, but the data can still be choppy.Last week, the layoffs werent as large as expected, a department spokesman said. That caused a steep drop in the seasonally adjusted data.The broader trend will become clearer in the coming weeks. Applications were declining slightly at the end of last year, pushing the four-week average to a four-year low in the last week of December.The applications figures "suggest the labor market is getting better, the issue remains the extent of the improvement," said Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank.Applications are a proxy for layoffs. Overall, applications remain at a level that suggests employers are hiring at a slow but steady pace. Applications fluctuated between 360,000 and 390,000 for most of last year. At the same time, employers added an average of 153,000 jobs a month.Thats just been enough to slowly push down the unemployment rate, which fell 0.7 percentage points last year to 7.8 percent.Employers added 155,000 jobs last month, nearly matching the average for the year. Decembers steady job gain suggests employers didnt cut back on hiring in the midst of the debate over the tax and spending changes known as the fiscal cliff. Many economists feared that the prospect of higher taxes and steep cuts in federal spending would cause a slowdown in job gains.Thats a good sign, since more budget showdowns are expected. Congress must vote to raise the governments $16.4 trillion borrowing limit by sometime between mid-February and early March. If not, the government risks defaulting on its debt. Republicans will likely demand deep spending cuts as the price of raising the debt limit.More than 5.8 million people received unemployment aid in the week ended Dec. 29, the latest data available. Thats about 465,000 more than the previous week. The figure includes about 2 million people who receive extended benefits paid for by the federal government. The rest receive aid under state unemployment programs, which usually last 26 weeks.The overall economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the July-September quarter. But economists believe activity slowed considerably in the October-December quarter to a rate below 2 percent or less, in part because companies cut back on restocking.	2013-01-17
1286	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/01/14/new-investigation-personal-finance-industry-reveals-leaders-gurus-often-serve/	New investigation of personal finance industry reveals leaders, gurus often serve themselves	This book cover image released by Portfolio/Penguin shows "Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry," by Helaine Olen. (AP Photo/Portfolio/Penguin)The Associated Press"Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry" (Portfolio/Penguin), by Helaine OlenAfter the financial crisis began in 2008, it suddenly became OK, even desirable, to talk about the illogic of ballooning borrowing and runaway stocks — and the inevitability that bubbles pop. For years, financial journalists had been required to "balance" their realization that lending had come loose from its moorings with industry assertions that things simply worked differently now. In 2008, we finally could say the emperor — the overavailability of all types of debt, the expectation that markets would heal all ills — had no clothes. We no longer had to wait for his side of the story.ADVERTISEMENTThat was a good thing. It made possible a whole new genre of nonfiction — highly readable deconstructions of how regulatory and moral gaps spawn financial excess and contributed to the collapse. There are even subgenres, including half-investigation-half-confessions. It is in this burgeoning category that Helaine Olen presents "Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry." Olen is taking on the sellers of a particularly insidious form of snake oil, the idea that if you try really hard — and maybe pay $29.95 for a book or $89.95 for an online "membership" or even more to attend a live program — you, too, can achieve financial success. A former Los Angeles Times reporter who made a career interviewing people about their personal finances and getting them professional advice, Olen opens with a rundown of major self-promoters in the field.Taking a thorough and deserved drubbing are Suze Orman ("rebuilding America one wallet at a time"), David Bach ("the Latte Factor"), Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko ("The Millionaire Next Door"), and Dave Ramsey (with seminars in Cancun and in churches and military bases across the U.S. promoting the elimination of personal debt). Hes particularly galling, given that he and his wife filed for bankruptcy protection in 1990, and his main recommendation is to get unemotional, stay out of debt and avoid bankruptcy. His prescription at www.daveramsey.com for a family living on $5,000 a month after taxes — far more than the U.S. median income — includes paying $1,250 for housing and $350 for health care. Thats a great idea, just not a reality for most middle-class Americans. Many of these self-styled advisers look absurd on close examination. And a huge red flag should pop up for anyone who knows that Orman largely refuses to invest in the same stocks and funds that she frequently promotes.Olen then translates the doublespeak of traditional personal finance institutions to reveal lots more hot air. There are mutual funds and retirement plans promoted for their safety that actually charge fees so high they can cut an accounts value by 28 percent over time (thats from a U.S. Labor Department report about 401(k) plans). She convincingly argues that the fad for "empowering" women to manage their own finances ends up doing the opposite. Olen sees even financial literacy education — with the simplistic message that security comes from planning and self-control — as a "myth," especially given that much of it is sponsored by usurious lenders reaping the considerable benefit of brand loyalty from their students. And forget variable annuities. Just forget you ever heard of them.Olens biggest gripes are that no one — not the policy makers, not do-gooders and not the industry whose advice she conveyed to hundreds of her Los Angeles Times subjects — is addressing income inequality and that American public policy offers little real support for low- and moderate-income Americans. But the part where she offers alternatives and outlines the new thinking shed like to see gets short shrift. And that makes her incisive criticism of the personal finance world sound like an intellectual exercise. Her closing observation, for instance, could have enriched her analysis throughout: She notes that the era of personal responsibility and economic growth that were asked to harken back to as we get our financial houses in order actually was an era when many government and corporate financial supports first matured. Maybe, just maybe, the rise of pensions and employer-sponsored health insurance, the G.I. bill, welfare as we knew it, and the building of the interstate highway system werent drags on prosperity. Could it be that they contributed to Americans personal financial security as they bolstered the economy as a whole?___Online:http://helaineolen.com/	2013-01-14

Thats a healthy gain, but down from 12.4 percent in the previous month and the smallest since March 2013.ADVERTISEMENTAnnual price gains slowed in 19 of the 20 cities. Only Boston saw price increases accelerate.Home sales have slowed since last summer as higher mortgage rates, rising prices and a limited supply of available homes have priced many would-be buyers out of the market.

That would be roughly in line with the 217,000 workers added in April. Average monthly job gains have averaged 213,600 this year.ADVERTISEMENTThe government will release the June employment report at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time Thursday.If more than 200,000 workers were added last month, it would mark the fifth consecutive month of job gains at least that high. Not since the height of the tech boom in 1999 and 2000 has hiring been that consistently strong.Analysts predict that the unemployment rate will remain 6.3 percent for a third straight month. If the rate stays flat despite solid hiring, it will likely be because more people out of work began seeking jobs last month. The government counts people as unemployed only if theyre actively seeking jobs. So when more people start looking for work, more are typically counted as jobless, and the unemployment rate can stay flat or even rise.Private payrolls provider ADP said Wednesday that businesses added 281,000 jobs in June. The figure suggests that the governments jobs report could bring a pleasant surprise. But the ADP numbers cover only private businesses, and they often diverge from the governments more comprehensive reportIn May, the economy surpassed its jobs total in December 2007, when the Great Recession started. But economists at the liberal Economic Policy Institute estimate that 7 million more jobs would have been needed to keep up with population growth.Many people who lost jobs during the recession and were never rehired have stopped looking for work. Just 62.8 percent of adult Americans are working or are looking for a job, compared with 66 percent before the recession.Average wages, meanwhile, have grown just 2 percent a year during the recovery, below the long-run average annual growth of about 3.5 percent.Many economists predicted late last year that the steady but tepid recovery would accelerate in 2014. The momentum built over the past four years will finally unleash more hiring and higher wages, they said.But the economy actually shrank in the first three months of this year at an annual rate of 2.9 percent. Thats the sharpest quarterly contraction since the recession. Ferocious winter storms and freezing temperatures caused factories to close and prevented consumers from visiting shopping malls and auto dealers.Yet the winter failed to freeze hiring. This should help to speed economic growth because more jobs lead to more paychecks to spend.Most economists say annualized growth is tracking 3 percent to 3.5 percent in the current second quarter. Growth over the course of the entire year should be closer to 2 percent for the entire year, roughly similar to the 1.9 percent increase in gross domestic product achieved last year.Other than the weak growth at the start of the year, the economys health appears to be improving.Auto sales rose at the fastest pace in eight years in June. Dealers unloaded vehicles at an annual pace of 16.98 million last month. Factory orders picked up last month as well, according to a report this week by the Institute for Supply Management.Home sales also strengthened in May, after having sputtered in the middle of last year when higher mortgage rates and rising prices hurt affordability.	2014-07-03

Another month of solid hiring is expected in the U.S. jobs report for June that will be released Thursday.ADVERTISEMENTYet 32 states still have fewer jobs than when the recession began in December 2007 — evidence of the unevenness and persistently slow pace of the recovery.Even though economists declared the recession over in June 2009, Illinois is still down 184,000 jobs from pre-recession levels. New Jersey is down 147,000. Both states were hurt by layoffs at factories. Florida is down 170,000 in the aftermath of its real estate market collapse.The sluggish job market could weigh on voters in some key states when they go to the polls this fall. A Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday found that voters named the economy by far the biggest problem facing the United States.The states where hiring lags the most tend to be those that were hit most painfully by the recession: They lost so many jobs that theyve struggled to replace them all.Nevada, which suffered a spectacular real estate bust and four years of double-digit unemployment — has fared worst. It has 6 percent fewer jobs than it did in December 2007. Arizona, also slammed by the housing collapse, is 5 percent short.By contrast, an energy boom has lifted several states to the top of job creation rankings."North Dakota is the No. 1 example," says Dan White, senior economist at Moodys Analytics. "Its like its own little gold rush."North Dakota has added 100,000 jobs since December 2007 — a stunning 28 percent increase, by far the nations highest. The state has benefited from technology that allows energy companies to extract oil from shale, sedimentary rock formed by the compression of clay and silt.Not surprisingly, the capital of North Dakota, Bismarck, has the lowest unemployment rate of any American city: 2.2 percent as of May.Also benefiting from the energy boom is Texas, which has added more than 1 million jobs since December 2007, an increase of nearly 10 percent. For comparison, the nation as a whole has added only a net 113,000 jobs over that period.Jobs in Washington D.C., where lobbying is an all but recession-proof occupation, are up 49,000, or 7 percent. The gain was led by a 10 percent increase in hiring by private employers.Wall Streets recovery from the financial crisis has helped New York gain 237,000 jobs since the recession ended, an increase of nearly 3 percent.Moodys White says many states are struggling because the recession wiped out solid middle-class jobs — in manufacturing and construction — that havent returned. He says it will take a stronger housing recovery to put significantly more people back to work building houses, installing wiring and plumbing and selling furniture and appliances to new owners of homes.Housing has rebounded somewhat since bottoming a couple of years ago. But the industrys recovery has slowed. Home construction is running at barely half the pace of the early and mid-2000s. And the United States has lost nearly 1.5 million construction workers since the end of 2007 — a 20 percent plunge. Nevada has lost half its construction workforce.Factories have added 105,000 jobs over the past year, but manufacturing payrolls remain down 1.6 million, or 12 percent, since the start of the recession. Manufacturing jobs in Michigan hit bottom in June 2009. But the state still has 45,000, or 7 percent, fewer factory workers than it did in December 2007.	2014-07-02

The Labor Departments job openings and labor turnover survey for February is released on Tuesday, April 8, 2014. (AP Photo/LM Otero, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  U.S. employers posted more job openings in February, a sign that hiring will likely improve in the months ahead.The Labor Department said Tuesday that employers advertised 4.2 million job openings, up 7.7 percent from January. Thats the highest number of postings since January 2008, when the Great Recession was just beginning and the economy had yet to suffer the full shock of the downturn.ADVERTISEMENTThere are roughly 2.5 unemployed Americans for each open job, the report shows. That average has slowly been approaching the 2 to 1 ratio is typical of healthier economies, after peaking at 6.7 unemployed people for each available job in July 2009, just after the recession ended.Hiring has accelerated over the past two months after a winter slowdown. After factoring in job losses, employers added 192,000 jobs in March and 197,000 in February, the government said last Friday.That was significantly higher than in December and January, when snowstorms reduced job growth. The unemployment rate has stayed at 6.7 percent for the past two months.Tuesdays government report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, offers a more complete picture of the job market. It includes additional data on hiring and the number of people quitting or being laid off.Total hiring rose 1.5 percent to 4.6 million in February. Thats still less than a healthy job market, where around 5 million people are hired each month.The number of people who quit their jobs rose slightly last month, the report said, while layoffs declined.The additional data in the JOLTs report illustrates how much turnover is happening in the job market. Stronger job markets usually include a greater amount of churn, with more people quitting and greater overall hiring.A rise in those quitting jobs can be a positive sign because people often depart for a new job or have confidence they will find one. More quits also open up more positions for job-seekers.Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, has said the central bank monitors the quits and hiring figures as key indicators of the job markets health. The figures help the Fed decide how to manage short-term interest rates and other efforts to foster financial stability.Openings rose in February in retail and business services, as well as in construction, education and health care, and hotels and restaurants. They dropped in manufacturing and retail.	2014-04-08

A key category that signals business investment plans increased at the fastest pace in four months.Orders for durable goods increased 2.6 percent in March following a 2.1 percent rise in February, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. Those back-to-back gains followed two big declines in December and January which had raised concerns about possible weakness in manufacturing.ADVERTISEMENTDemand for core capital goods, considered a good guide for business investment plans, rose 2.2 percent in March after a 1.1 percent drop in February. It was the best showing since a 3 percent rise in November.Manufacturing seems to be recovering after a cold winter disrupted business activity.The strength in March was widespread, led by a 4 percent increase in demand for transportation goods. Orders for commercial aircraft advanced 8.6 percent while demand for motor vehicles and parts rose a more modest 0.4 percent.Excluding transportation, orders rose a solid 2 percent, the best showing in this category in more than a year.Orders for primary metals such as steel rose 2 percent while demand for heavy machinery, computers and communications equipment all showed increases.The gains in orders for durable goods, products expected to last at least three years, were the latest sign that the economy is gaining momentum following a harsh winter.The Institute for Supply Management, a group of purchasing managers, reported that its closely watched index of manufacturing activity grew at a slightly faster pace in March, rising to a level of 53.7, compared to 53.2 in February. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing.Manufacturing activity had plunged in January as harsh snow storms shut down factories and disrupted supply shipments and then rebounded slightly in February as orders and stockpiles grew. The overall index remains below the level that prevailed in the second half of last year, when it regularly topped 56.Last year, U.S. factories were cranking out appliances, autos and other goods at a healthy pace until harsh winter weather descended. The ISMs index rose for six straight months until dipping slightly in December. That was followed by Januarys sharp fall.Economists believe the severe winter weather contributed to slowing overall growth to a lackluster annual rate possible as low as 1 percent in the January-March quarter.But they are looking for the warmer weather to unleash pent-up demand that will kick growth in the April-June quarter to around 3 percent. That stronger growth is expected to last for the rest of the year, lifting the economy to its best performance since the Great Recession ended in mid-2009.	2014-04-24

Nikki Haley, South Carolina’s newest gun manufacturer has received an “absolutely tremendous” amount of support since leaving Connecticut for The Palmetto State, according to the firms CEO.Josh Fiorini, CEO of PTR Industries, formerly of Bristol., Conn., told FoxNews.com that the firm’s new facility in Aynor, S.C., remains a week away from production, but 11 local employees began sorting inventory on Monday along with a team of training personnel from Connecticut. The manufacturer of military-style rifles announced in April that it intended to leave Bristol following the passage of gun-control legislation after the shooting deaths of 26 people, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown.ADVERTISEMENT“In general, things are going very well,” Fiorini said Tuesday. “Basically, we’re just unpacking and training right now, but the building is coming together and we’re putting on the final touches. We’re all very excited.”- Josh Fiorini, CEO, PTR IndustriesThe company, which purchased its new 58,000-square-foot facility at a discounted price of $3 million and reportedly received an undisclosed amount of tax rebates, employed more than 40 employees in Connecticut and 21 of them will move to South Carolina. Fiorini said it will hire an additional 30 workers within the first quarter of 2014, with a goal of having 120 employees in 2017.“The facility that we’re going to move into is fantastically better than the one we’re coming from,” he said. “It allows us to consolidate two facilities into one and it’s much more modern, allowing us to set up our line in a more efficient way and hopefully expand.”Among its full-time positions, which include health care and dental plans, Fiorini said assembly line workers can earn up to $20 per hour depending on experience, while machine operators are paid up to $25 hourly. Salaries for engineers and managers, meanwhile, can reach $80,000, he said."It’s a big range,” he said. “And what we really want to do here is get to about 120 [employees] within three years and to be around 150 within five years.”Roughly 2,000 people applied for 30 positions within the company in November, Fiorini said.Bob Grabowski, a councilman in Horry County, was the company’s first hire in South Carolina back in October. Grabowski later joined PTR Industries as a full-time employee in December and now works as its purchasing manager. Grabowski said he was one of the early proponents for the move to a more “pro-gun” atmosphere, especially when compared to Connecticut.“The political welcoming has been very good,” said Grabowski, adding that Hailey and Rep. Tom Rice supported the June announcement for the move. “It’s been a very exciting and welcoming atmosphere for PTR. My perception is that Connecticut wasn’t very welcoming to PTR Industries in general and legislated them out of business and out of the state, whereas the political climate in South Carolina is very different.”Grabowski continued: “There’s a lot of people down here very excited about this place. Most people around here are very pro-gun.”Lisa Bourcier, public information director for Horry County, told FoxNews.com that the county experienced a “good year” in job growth since PTR Industries announced its plans to join the Cool Springs Business Park near Aynor.“Our area leaders think its not too far-fetched to believe Horry County could very well be a major player in the gun manufacturing industry,” Bourcier said in an email to FoxNews.com. “The great thing is we have a council thats focused on economic development, and were all working together to bring more jobs to our community.”Fiorini, meanwhile, said the company will no longer feel like the “dirty little secret” it did in Connecticut.“I have personally been able to get a very good feel from South Carolina, from the governor down to the local beat cops to your average citizen,” he said. “The welcoming has been tremendous. People on the street, cashiers at the gas station or the pizza place, or even TSA agents, they know who we are and they’re happy to have us. In Connecticut, we always felt like a dirty little secret. Down there, it’s very much the opposite.”Magpul Industries, an ammunition magazine manufacturer, announced last week it plans to make good on its threat to leave Colorado due to new restrictions on guns, including the ban of ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds. The company, which employs roughly 250 people, will move its corporate headquarters to Texas.	2014-01-07

But what about the airlines?Old concerns about electronics being a danger to airplane navigation have been debunked. And airlines could make some extra cash charging passengers to call a loved one from 35,000 feet. But that extra money might not be worth the backlash from fliers who view overly chatty neighbors as another inconvenience to go along with smaller seats and stuffed overhead bins.ADVERTISEMENT"Common courtesy goes out the window when people step in that metal tube," says James Patrick II, a frequent flier from Newnan, Ga. "You think the debates and fistfights over reclining the seat back was bad. Wait until guys start slugging it out over someone talking too loud on the phone."Thats one of the reasons the countrys largest flight attendant union has come out against allowing calls in flight. The FCC is proposing to lift an existing ban, and airlines would have to decide whether to let passengers make calls. The ban would remain in effect during takeoff and landing.Delta Air Lines is the only major airline to explicitly state that voice calls wont be allowed on its flights, even if the FCC allows it. Delta says years of feedback from customers show "the overwhelming sentiment" is to continue prohibiting calls.Other airlines arent as firm.United Airlines punted the question, saying if the FCC changes its rules, "we will study it along with feedback from customers and crews." American Airlines offered a similar approach. So did JetBlue, which says it would "welcome the opportunity to explore" voice calls but "would prioritize making the cabin comfortable and welcoming for all."Confused yet?Well, to complicate matters even more, the airlines actually dont need to wait for the FCC. Yes, the government would need to remove the restriction for you to make normal calls in flight. But there are already plenty of ways to make calls legally over airline Wi-Fi networks, while keeping your phone in "airplane mode." The airlines just choose to block such calls.Just as many schools and workplaces block access to pornography websites, airlines use similar filters to block access to Skype and other Internet calling services.Gogo Inc., which provides Internet access on American, Alaska Airlines, Delta, United, US Airways and Virgin America flights, recently announced a new service for passengers to send and receive text messages or make phone calls using Wi-If.An unnamed U.S. airline will launch the service early next year with only text-messaging capabilities."We know that the talk portion for commercial aviation is not really something airlines or their passengers want," Gogo spokesman Steve Nolan says.The talk function was designed for private jets and international airlines. Most Middle East airlines and a few in Asia and Europe already allow voice calls on planes.Gogos chief competitor, Global Eagle Entertainment Inc.s Row 44, will debut gate-to-gate text service for $2 a flight on select Southwest Airlines aircraft Monday.Tom Wheeler, who became the FCCs chairman three weeks ago, issued a statement Thursday saying that "modern technologies can deliver mobile services in the air safely and reliably and the time is right to review our outdated and restrictive rules." Travelers protested to the agency and on social media. On a White House website, a petition opposing the FCCs move attracted more than 1,700 signatures by Saturday morning.Wheeler backed off Friday. He clarified that "airlines are best positioned" to make decisions about whats in the interests of passengers. The FCCs role should just be to decide what is safe or not, and cellphone calls are safe, he said. "We understand that many passengers would prefer that voice calls not be made on airplanes," Wheeler said. "I feel that way myself."Wheeler declined to speak with The Associated Press. Any change would likely take at least a year to take effect.Airline consultant Robert Mann says airlines have been using the FCC as an excuse not to allow cellphone use. He believes the agency wants to get itself out of the equation.Airlines "ought to own up to what the real issues are," Mann says. "Theyre not technology. Theyre not regulatory. Its a business decision."The Federal Aviation Administration recently lifted its ban on personal electronic devices, such as iPads and Kindles, under 10,000 feet. But the FCCs announcement that it would discuss its phone prohibition at its Dec. 12 meeting came as a surprise."I was not aware this was anywhere near the front burner. I didnt even know it was on the stove at the commission," says Harry Cole, a communications regulations lawyer at Fletcher, Heald and Hildreth in Arlington, Va.Angela Giancarlo, a former FCC official and now a partner at law firm Mayer Brown, says the proposal was in the works before Wheeler became chairman. She suspects that the FCC expected the proposal would be greeted favorably because it could allow passengers to remain connected.If phone calls are eventually allowed on planes -- whether through Wi-Fi or traditional means -- somebody still has to relay that signal to the ground. That provider, in partnership with the airline, would likely charge a fee. Cell carriers probably wouldnt profit off such calls.Amtrak and many local commuter railways have created quiet cars for those who dont want to be trapped next to a loud talker. Its easy to envision airlines offering "quiet rows," although there will probably be an extra fee to sit there.Ultimately, the FCC is going to make its decision based on safety, not public opinion, says Harold Feld, a senior vice president at advocacy group Public Knowledge."The decision on this is going to be made on the basis of real engineering facts and not about whether people enjoy being away from cellphones or not," Feld says.U.S. airlines have tried in-flight calls before. Some passengers will remember bulky satellite phones that rested on the back of seats. Few travelers paid for the expensive calls. Airlines eventually ripped out the phones in favor of another distraction: seatback TVs.	2013-11-23

By one estimate, about $5 billion.The country may be warming up from the polar vortex, but the bone-chilling cold, snow and ice that gripped much of the country — affecting about 200 million people — brought about the biggest economic disruption delivered by the weather since Superstorm Sandy in 2012, said Evan Gold, senior vice president at Planalytics, a business weather intelligence company in suburban Philadelphia.ADVERTISEMENTWhile the impact came nowhere close to Sandy, which caused an estimated $65 billion in property damage alone, the deep freezes impact came from its breadth."Theres a lot of economic activity that didnt happen," Gold said. "Some of that will be made up but some of it just gets lost."Still, Gold noted his $5 billion estimate pales in comparison with an annual gross domestic product of about $15 trillion — working out to maybe one-seventh to one-eighth of one days production for the entire country."Its a small fraction of a percent, but its still an impact," Gold said.Major U.S. airlines, which canceled about 20,000 flights starting last Thursday, lost anywhere from $50 million to $100 million, said Helane Becker, an analyst with Cowen and Co. in New York.JetBlue was hit especially hard because 80 percent of its flights go through New York or Boston, where the carrier shut down Monday evening into Tuesday. The airline also was affected by other airport closures and new regulations limiting pilot hours.School closures took their own toll, keeping home parents who couldnt find alternatives for their kids. Even if those parents worked from home, they might not have been as productive, said Tony Madden, regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis."People in the northern climates are used to dealing with issues of snow and cold," Madden said. "However, when you get a one-in-20-year event like this, that disrupts activities."The insurance industry has yet to estimate costs, but Robert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute in New York, said insurers plan for about $1.4 billion in winter storm catastrophe losses in any given year."We certainly know there is an epidemic of frozen and burst pipes this week," Hartwig said.Damage to a Minnesota state health laboratory in St. Paul could top $1 million after the heating system failed and pipes leaked. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentleys home in Tuscaloosa took an estimated $50,000 blow from a burst water pipe. Roto-Rooter in Minneapolis and elsewhere has been "inundated" with calls about burst pipes and even frozen sewer lines since the cold snap, plumbing manager Paul Teale said.Governments are meanwhile tallying costs for depleted road salt reserves, blown overtime budgets and repairs.Other impacts will be felt in about 30 days when high heating bills start coming due, Gold said, which will affect how much consumers can spend in February.But somebody always benefits, he said.On-demand cable TV and restaurant delivery services gained, as did home centers and convenience stores where people went to stock up. Online retailers benefited from customers with an estimated $30 billion worth of new holiday gift cards burning holes in their pockets, he said.Other beneficiaries may be farther away. Boston-based Hopper Research says the frigid temperatures caused a 52 percent spike in searches for flights to Cancun, Mexico, from people in Minneapolis and Chicago.___Associated Press writers Josh Freed in Minneapolis and Jayson Keyser in Chicago contributed to this report.	2014-01-09

Fewer homes entering the foreclosure pipeline should translate into fewer properties that eventually end up lost to foreclosure."Its looking really good that there are not more coming into the pipeline," said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac. "Barring any other economic shock to the system, we expect that to bode well going forward."Foreclosure starts fell on an annual basis in the third quarter in 38 states, including Colorado, Arizona, California and Illinois. They increased from a year earlier in 11 states, including Maryland, Oregon, New Jersey and Connecticut.While fewer homes are entering the foreclosure process, lenders stepped up home repossessions, which led to a quarterly increase in homes lost to foreclosure.Completed foreclosures rose 7 percent in the third quarter versus the April-June period, the firm said. Completed foreclosures were down 24 percent from the third quarter last year, however.All told, 119,485 homes were taken back by lenders in the July-September quarter. That puts the nation on pace to end this year with roughly 507,497 completed foreclosures, or down about 24 percent from 2012s total.Foreclosures peaked in 2010 at 1.05 million and have been declining ever since.The number of homes taken back by banks in the third quarter climbed from the previous quarter in 26 states, including New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Virginia, RealtyTrac said.Much of the quarterly increase in foreclosures came about in states where courts oversee the foreclosure process. Those courts were backed up with cases two years ago, but have been making progress working through their backlog.Even so, its taking longer for homes in many states to complete the foreclosure process.In the third quarter, it took an average of 551 days, or 1.5 years, for a U.S. home to move from initial default status to ultimately being repossessed by the lender, the firm said.Thats up from an average of 526 days in the second quarter and an increase from 382 days in the third quarter of last year."Its a sign that were still dealing with the wreckage of the last housing bust," Blomquist said.In New York, it took an average of 1,037 days, or nearly three years, for the foreclosure process to run its course in the third quarter, the longest of any state. Maine clocked the shortest average time to foreclose at 160 days.The impact of foreclosures remains sharply elevated in some states.Florida topped the nation with a foreclosure rate of more than twice the national average in the third quarter.Rounding out the top 10 states with the highest foreclosure rates in the July-September period were: Nevada, Maryland, Illinois, Ohio, Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, Indiana and South Carolina.	2013-10-10

"We get in the court, and I think today was more about inside, not about tennis. It was about how you play, how you feel in the court, and how can you handle the situation."Pennetta will play the winner of Wednesdays later quarterfinal between No. 2 Victoria Azarenka and 48th-ranked Daniela Hantuchova. No. 1 Serena Williams and No. 5 Li Na won Tuesday to secure spots in the other semifinal.After Pennettas win, eighth-seeded Richard Gasquet got the first spot in this years mens semifinals, defeating No. 4 David Ferrer 6-3, 6-1, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3 in a match that ran 3 hours, 23 minutes. Gasquet made his second Grand Slam semifinal, the only other coming at Wimbledon in 2007.Gasquet came in off a five-set win over Milos Raonic in the fourth round that improved him to 6-12 in five-setters for his career. Ferrer was 19-9. After Ferrer won the third and fourth sets to even the match, he looked like a good bet to finish the comeback."Hes a big fighter," Gasquet said. "I knew I had to serve well. Its important against a big player like that."Indeed, Gasquet got 70 percent of his first serves in during the fifth set and saved the only break point against him. Hell face the winner of a later quarterfinal between No. 19 Tommy Robredo and No. 2 Rafael Nadal."The last time I beat him, I was 13 years old," Gasquet said about Nadal. "Ive beaten him one time in my life."Indeed, Nadal has won all 10 meetings between the men on the pro circuit.The womens match marked the ninth meeting between Vinci and Pennetta, who, back in 2009, became the first Italian woman to crack the top 10. But she fell out of the spotlight in her countrys tennis scene after the emergence of Vinci and Sara Errani, combined with a wrist injury that sidelined her during the end of last season.Pennetta came into Flushing Meadows ranked 83rd, but will leave with victories over both of Italys top players.After her win over Vinci, the Italians met at the net and hugged. Vinci gave Pennetta a kiss on the cheek and told her, "Brava.""Shes someone who, when she wants something, she wants it all costs, which is the right way to be," Vinci said. "It might seem strange to say it, but its great when a person gets back to this level after an operation. She deserves to be in the semifinals."Unlike most women in this era of baseline tennis, Vinci attacked the net 34 times. But she won only 18 of those points. She finished with 14 winners and 28 unforced errors. Trailing 5-4 in the first, Vinci saved a pair of set points and had two chances to break, but couldnt convert either. Vinci attacked the net on the last two points of the set, but Pennetta hit shots Vinci couldnt handle both times to close things out.The second set took only 24 minutes.Vinci said her style is, well, her style, and it has served her well through a career that brought her into the top 15 for the first time this summer."Yes, of course I have a different kind of tennis," she said. "This is my key. Sometimes it helps me, sometimes not. Depends, of course, the opponent."In this case, the opponent knew what to expect. No big surprise considering theyve known each other since they were juniors, have played on Italian Fed Cup teams together and have even played doubles together on the tour. After completing the win that gave her a 5-4 edge in the series against Vinci, Pennetta spoke with reverence about her friend."Shes Roberta, and shes the only one," Pennetta said.Vinci acknowledged that, yes, there were nerves, but not necessarily because of the person on the other side of the net. This was Vincis third straight match against an Italian foe."By now, Im used to playing (them). Its not like this was the first," she said. "Theres always pressure. Even if Williams was on the other side, there would have been the same amount of tennis. It didnt have the sort of effect you might think."This was Pennettas fourth straight win over a seeded opponent — a stretch that began with a 6-3, 6-1 win over fourth-seeded Errani and also included a victory over No. 27 Svetlana Kuznetsova, the 2004 U.S. Open champion."I play good tennis with Sara, with Kuznetsova," Pennetta said. "Every day, much better and better."Pennetta hasnt lost a set en route to the final four of the years last major.Pennetta is 31, while Hantuchova and Vinci are both 30 — part of a group of five thirty-somethings to reach the quarterfinals this year, matching the most in the Open era of Grand Slam tennis."Its good to stay physical, in a good way, and play this good tennis at this age, of course," Pennetta said. "Im proud of (myself) now. Im 31, and physically, I feel good finally. Im in the first semifinal in Grand Slam. There is nothing to say more."	2013-09-04

Signet Jewelers is buying Zale Corp. for approximately $690 million to help diversify its business and expand further internationally. Shares of Zale soared more than 39 percent in Wednesday, Feb. 19, 2014, premarket trading, while Signet Jewelers Ltd. stock rose more than 9 percent. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, file)The Associated PressDALLAS –  All the single ladies: Put your hands up!The largest U.S. jewelry chain on Wednesday decided to put a ring on its much smaller rival, creating a $6 billion jewelry juggernaut with expansive reach in North America.ADVERTISEMENTSignet Jewelers, owner of Jared The Galleria with its "He went to Jared" slogan and Kay Jeweler with its "Every Kiss Begins with Kay" ads, agreed to buy Zale for roughly $900 million.Turns out, diamonds arent just a girls proverbial best friend; Investors seemed to like them on Wednesday, too. On news of the planned acquisition, Signets stock rose more than 18 percent, while shares of Zale soared more than 40 percent.The deal underscores the harsh realities of the $32. 8 billion jewelry business since the Great Recession. Sales of necklaces, rings and other jewels got hammered during the economic downturn as shoppers pulled back on their discretionary purchases.Now, business is slowly starting to come back during the economic recovery. But there are still a number of jewelry chains in the market, and sales are still far from their pre-recession peak of more than $36 billion in 2006."The deal is a rational response to the imbalance of supply and demand," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consultancy in New Canaan, Conn. "There are too many stores chasing too few jewelry buyers."In fact, analysts say the abundance of stores is a scenario that has played out in malls across the country where some of Signets stores go head-to-head with Zales stores. But they say Signet has fared better.Signet has 1,400 Jared and Kay stores in the U.S. and 500 stores in the U.K. under the names H. Samuel and Ernest Jones. Kay has tried attracting customers by creating exclusive collections under names like Jane Seymour.Signet Jewelers Ltd., which is based in Bermuda, reported that revenue at stores opened at least a year rose 5 percent during in November and December combined. By division, the sales metric at Kay rose 5.6 percent, while at Jared sales rose 5.6 percent during that period.On the other hand, Zale Corp., which is based in Dallas, has 1,680 stores in North America under Zales, Gordons and other names. The company, which went through a liquidity crisis in 2009, has been trying to expand its bridal merchandise.Zale, which has closed hundreds of stores, returned to a profit in its most recent fiscal year, which ended July 31. More recently the company reported its sales in stores open at least one year rose 2 percent in November and December. By division, Zales branded stores had a 4.4 percent increase in the sales metric for the two-month period.Together, the two chains would have 16 percent of the U.S. jewelry market, according to IBISWorld, a market research firm.But even before the acquisition, Signet, with expected annual revenue at $4.2 billion in the latest fiscal year ended in January, was the largest jewelry chain. Higher-end Tiffany & Co. has anticipated annual revenue of $4.0 billion, with a wider international presence in such countries as the United Arab Emirates and China.As part of the deal, Signet said it will pay $21 per share. Thats a 41 percent premium to Zales $14.91 Tuesday closing price. Zale has about 32.9 million outstanding shares, according to FactSet, for which Signet would pay about $690 million.Part of the deal are about 11.1 million warrants, a security issued by a company that gives the holder the right to buy securities, owned by Golden Gate Capital, a 22 percent stakeholder in Zale, according to Zale spokeswoman Roxane Barry. Signet entered into a voting and support agreement with Golden Gate.The companies value the deal at $1.4 billion, including assumed debt. Excluding the roughly $500 million in debt Zale had as of Oct. 31, according to SEC filings, but including the price to buy out Golden Gates warrants, the deal is worth about $900 million.The acquisition still needs approval from Zale shareholders. Killion is expected to remain Zale CEO. Killion said in a statement that the move will help accelerate growth, coming after Zale completed its "multi-year turnaround program to return to profitability."___AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman in New York contributed to this report.	2014-02-19

Most Internet users in the U.S. have access to about 4.5 megabits of Internet speed. Yet the 600 square mile fiber optic grid under Chattanooga offers residents and businesses a blazing 50 megabits. Business leaders are capitalizing on the fast Internet speeds by launching two initiatives to attract bright minds to the city, create jobs and stimulate the economy.  GeekMove and the GigTank:You might call them "Geeks" but Chattanooga civic and business leaders see this new crop of Internet wizards, software developers and computer programmers as future residents.  They are hoping their new incentive program called, "GeekMove" will attract tech geeks. Its an offer loaded with paid relocation expenses and mortgage assistance."The thought behind the GeekMove is -- we have this gig fiber here – why wouldnt people who need that gig fiber want to come take advantage of it every day," Garrison said.  "[Its] so rewarding when we do get those folks who are on board with us -- they want to be here in Chattanooga, and they want to come be a part of whats going on here."It is a geeky way to get boost business in a city known mostly for its natural scenery. The relocation offers are granted after a committee reviews potential applicants and decides who meets pre-determined criteria. Its available to people applying for tech-related jobs and those who might be interested in launching their own business in the city."So far weve had about 100 applications, and interest has been high," Garrison said. "Weve had applications from all over the world."Business leaders also hold summer-long competitions every year called the GigTank. Teams, made up of recent college grads and established entrepreneurs, receive $15,000 to participate in a 100-day program to develop new computer applications and improve business plans for existing companies. Past "GigTankers" created data sharing websites for scientists and language translating applications that could be used by businesses.  Jack Studer a partner at Lampost Group, a conglomerate of upstart tech-related businesses, is also one of the organizers of Gig Tank."Its an effort to bring entrepreneurs and students to Chattanooga -- to live in an environment with this fiber optic network and sort of explore the possibility of – what do we do with this stuff," Studer said.Brian Trautschold also participates in the GigTank.  He is the co-founder of Fireplug, a business which personalizes news headlines through a Smartphone application. The fast Internet speeds in Chattanooga has allowed him to move a lot of data at one time.  "You can deal with a lot of data very quickly, you can analyze a lot of data quickly-- so we dont have some of the same of restrictions as companies that are based in Silicon Valley or New York and the cost is much cheaper for us to use that big data," Trautschold said. "The number one thing when youre starting a company is you have to reel in the costs. You want to do as much as cheaply as possible."Trautschold went on to say its created an ecosystem that is growing and he says watching more businesses come in to participate in the Gig Tank, has been inspiring.Elizabeth Prann currently serves as a Washington-based correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).

1018	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/02/12/rate-late-payments-on-us-home-mortgages-slides-to-lowest-level-since-early-2008/	Rate of late payments on US home mortgages slides to lowest level since early 2008	LOS ANGELES –  U.S. homeowners are doing a better job of keeping up with mortgage payments, a trend that has reduced the rate of late payment on home loans to the lowest level in more than five years.The percentage of mortgage holders at least two months behind on their payments fell in the October-December quarter to 3.85 percent from 5.08 percent a year earlier, credit reporting agency TransUnion said Wednesday.ADVERTISEMENTThe last time the mortgage delinquency rate was lower was 3.61 percent in the second quarter of 2008. The firms data go back to the second quarter of 2007.The latest rate also declined from 4.09 percent in the third quarter, the firm said.Struggling homeowners have seen their finances shorn up by rising home values, an improving job market and efforts to restructure home loans so theyre more affordable. That has enabled them to make timely payments.Another key driver in the improved late-payment rate: Many of the risky home loans made before 2008 that went unpaid are no longer a factor, since the homes have been sold or foreclosed upon. Loans issued since then, after banks tightened lending standards, are less likely to go unpaid."We are on the downward slope of the mortgage delinquency curve, so we expect to continue seeing delinquency rates that have not been seen for several years," said Steve Chaouki, head of financial services for TransUnion.The rate of late payments on home loans has been steadily declining over the past two years. At the same time, U.S. home sales and prices have been rebounding over the past two years, while foreclosures have been declining.Moderate but stable job gains, still-low mortgage interest rates, and tight supply of homes for sale have helped fuel the housing rebound. Thats also made it easier for homeowners to refinance, catch up on payments or sell their home, avoiding foreclosure.Many borrowers also are making keeping up with their mortgage payments a priority over other financial obligations, encouraged by rising home values and lower unemployment, Chaouki said.This is a reversal of a trend during the last recession and housing downturn, which left many homeowners owing more on their home than it was worth.Even so, the mortgage delinquency rate is still about twice as high as it was before the housing bubble burst in 2007. That suggests that many homeowners still are struggling to make their payments. It also reflects that many home loans made during the housing boom remain unpaid but have yet to work their way through the foreclosure process.TransUnion expects that mortgage delinquencies will continue to decline, falling to a rate of 3.7 percent by the end of March. The forecast assumes the U.S. economy will continue to strengthen and foreclosures will continue to thin out the backlog of older loans gone unpaid.All told, all the states and the District of Columbia posted sharp annual declines in their mortgage late-payment rate for the fourth quarter, the firm said.Arizona (38.6 percent), California (37.8 percent) and Nevada (34.7 percent) had the biggest annual declines. Only New York and New Jersey didnt post a double-digit percentage drop in their mortgage delinquency rate.Meanwhile, the number of new home loans made by lenders fell in the third quarter as interest rates spiked last summer.The data lags by a quarter, so the latest TransUnion figures cover the July-September period. They show that new home loans originated during the quarter declined to 1.9 million from 2.3 million in the third quarter of 2012.The share of new home loans made to borrowers with less-than-perfect credit grew to 6.61 percent from 5.55 percent a year earlier. Thats still well below the roughly 16.3 percent share of new mortgages that went to non-prime borrowers in the third quarter of 2007, just before the recession.In the VantageScore credit rating scale, borrowers with a score lower than 700 on a scale of 501-990 are considered non-prime borrowers.	2014-02-12

Tourism officials vowed to launch a competing rodeo.ADVERTISEMENT"We are disappointed that the PRCA has chosen to pursue a completely speculative offer versus Las Vegas proven 29-year track record," Michael Mack, spokesman for Las Vegas Events, said in a statement. "Now that we know the PRCAs true intentions, we will put our full effort into developing a new Series and Finals."The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association board voted 6-3 Sunday to turn down Sin Citys offer in favor of an agreement with Floridas Osceola County, south of Orlando.Osceola County commissioners voted 5-0 Sunday to accept a memorandum of understanding that allows 90 days to close the deal. The plan calls for the 2015 event to be held at the nearby Amway Center, home of the Orlando Magic; county officials vowed to have a new, 24,000-seat arena ready for the event by the fall of 2016.The deal also would include $16 million annually for the rodeo associations prize money and administrative costs, as well as revenue sharing."I say weve put together the best incentive package for the PRCA," said Osceola County Commission Chairman Fred Hawkins Jr., who added that hes not ruling out other contender cities just yet. "We have all the venues here to do exactly what the NFR does in Vegas."The 300,000-person county, home to a rodeo once considered the largest east of the Mississippi, offered about $4 million more than Las Vegas."Adding an additional $4 million to the budget would require a 40 percent increase in ticket prices," Mack said. "That is not sustainable. We have to balance the demands of the PRCA with the consequence of pricing our fans out of the market."The National Finals Rodeo has been an economic boon for Las Vegas, drawing almost 53,000 out-of-town visitors in 2012, according to figures compiled by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau. That was up from about 45,000 in 2011.More than 175,000 tickets were sold in 2012 for 10-day event at the Thomas & Mack Center, and the overall economic impact on hotel rooms, restaurants and other expenses was estimated at nearly $93 million, authority spokeswoman Dawn Christensen said.Figures for the 2013 event, which ended Saturday, werent immediately available.The event is a big draw for locals and out-of-towners alike, with country music concerts and rodeo-watching parties held at casinos all over town. Ads on taxis welcome the NFR, while hundreds of vendors pack the Las Vegas Convention Center for a giant Cowboy Fanfest and the Cowboy Christmas Gift Show."Extremely disappointed that the #WranglerNFR is leaving the @CityOfLasVegas," tweeted Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada."Without question, the economy and Vegas workers will feel the negative impact of losing thousands of Rodeo tourists," said Yvanna Cancela, spokeswoman for the large Culinary Union.Rodeo officials emphasized the decision is not yet final."The PRCA Board did not vote to leave Las Vegas; the vote was made strictly on the content of the current offer," association commissioner Karl Stressman said in a statement, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. "The PRCA continues to carefully consider offers from all potential WNFR hosts."___Associated Press writer Ken Ritter contributed to this report.	2013-12-16

While it has recovered, its shares have not returned to their peak, reached just six months before the recession began.Last week, the company closed on the sale of Steinway Hall just down the street from Carnegie Hall, its flagship showroom in Manhattan where generations of pianists have taken pianos for a spin.However, with the housing crisis fading and the U.S. economy picking up steam, Kohlberg is betting on a bright future for Steinway at home and abroad, says Burt Flickinger III, president of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group.A typical Steinway grand piano costs around $50,000, but can run much higher.Kohlberg, which will take the company private, is opening a tender offer to buy all of Steinways outstanding stock for $35 per share, a 15 percent premium to its Friday closing price of $30.43.The board of the Waltham, Mass., company unanimously recommended that shareholders tender their stock.The deal includes a 45-day "go-shop" period in which Steinway may seek out alternative bids.Steinway & Sons was founded in 1853 by German immigrant Henry Engelhard Steinway in a loft on Manhattans lower west side. Steinway was a master cabinet maker who built his first piano in the kitchen of his Seesen, Germany home, according to the company website.Over the next 30 years, Steinway and his sons, C.F. Theodore, Charles, Henry Jr., William and Albert developed the modern piano. The companys products now include Bach Stradivarius trumpets, Selmer Paris saxophones, C.G. Conn French horns, Leblanc clarinets, King trombones, Ludwig snare drums and Steinway & Sons pianos."Kohlbergs long history of collaboration to grow and expand some of the worlds leading consumer brands makes us an ideal partner for Steinway to accelerate its global expansion, while ensuring the artisanal manufacturing processes that make the companys products unique are preserved, celebrated and treasured," Kohlberg partner Christopher Anderson said.The buyout is expected to close in the third quarter.Flickinger says that emerging markets like China present a big opportunity for Steinway and for Kohlberg. "Families will want their children to play on the best piano," Flickinger said of China, the worlds second largest economy, where incomes are on the rise.Shares of Steinway Musical Instruments Inc. jumped $4.83, or more than 15 percent, to $35.26 in afternoon trading. Shares this year have risen close to 70 percent.	2013-07-01
1252	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/01/16/moody-revises-outlook-to-negative-for-entire-higher-education-sector/	Moodys revises outlook to negative for entire higher education sector	Moodys Investors Service on Wednesday downgraded its outlook for the higher education sector to negative across the board, saying even prestigious, top-tier research universities are now under threat from declining enrollment, government spending cuts and even growing public doubts over the value of a college degree.Previously, its outlook had been stable for those better-positioned institutions, and negative for the rest.ADVERTISEMENTThe report explaining the decision outlines a range of financial challenges now burdening virtually all institutions, though in different measures in different places — stagnant family income that limits pricing power, substantial state funding cuts, a demographic dip in the population of new high school graduates and a federal budget standoff that almost certainly bodes ill for the future flow of dollars for research and student-aid programs like Pell Grants.And despite the obvious pressure, Moodys says too many college leaders still havent made the bold choices required to survive and thrive."The actions that have been taken right now are fairly reactionary — cutting expense in order to align with the revenue declines, but not looking at the structural changes to how universities do business," said Moodys vice president and senior analyst Karen Kedem in a telephone interview.The report speaks to a painful reality in the field: While institutions continue to increase tuition much faster than overall inflation, angering parents and politicians, most are in fact struggling to collect much more tuition revenue.While colleges raise their list prices and collect more from those who can afford to pay, most simply cannot fill seats without offering substantial discounts. The report cites federal data showing the average American familys net worth declined 39 percent in the three years ending in 2010, dropping to its lowest level since 1992. Increasingly, price is a factor for families.A separate survey of about 300 colleges released last week by Moodys found about one-third were expecting tuition revenue this year either to decline or fail to keep pace with inflation. A few years ago, virtually all colleges were seeing tuition revenue rise.Enrollment fell this fall in about half of colleges, and there have been sharp drop-offs in graduate business and law programs, which traditionally have been key revenue sources for many institutions.Even at brand-name universities "all of their revenue streams, whether its research or fundraising or patient care, all of them are pressured in this environment," Kedem said.Much of higher education has always operated on the financial edge, and with endowments recovering, times now may well be better than at the height of the recent recession. (Moodys also gave the entire higher ed sector a negative outlook in 2009-2010, returning to a stable outlook for top-tier universities the next year.)But lately there have also been growing challenges involving the publics perception of the value of college.In particular, the report notes "alarm over a potential student loan bubble and diminishing affordability of higher education has reached a fevered pitch over the last two years." While acknowledging postsecondary education "remains a valuable long-term investment," the report argues burgeoning student loan debt and seemingly endless tuition increases are raising public doubts that may continue to affect colleges even if the economy recovers strongly."Its been such a massive outcry that has caught the publics attention, and it has just intensified the stress on colleges and their ability to grow net tuition revenue," said Moodys analyst and assistant vice president Eva Bogaty . "The public discourse and the scrutiny has attracted so much attention, thats not going to just fall away in the next year or two.

1288	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/11/22/black-friday-creeps-into-thursday/	Black Friday ushers in start of holiday shopping season	Nov. 22, 2012: A shopper carries bags stuffed with toys in the Times Square Toys-R-Us store after doors were opened in New York.NEW YORK –  Black Friday got off to its earliest start ever as the nations shoppers put their turkey down and headed directly to the malls.Stores typically open in the wee hours of the morning on the day after Thanksgiving thats named Black Friday because that is when they traditionally turn a profit for the year. But Black Friday openings have crept earlier and earlier over the past few years. This year, crowds gathered across the country as stores from Target to Toys R Us opened their doors as early as Thanksgiving evening.ADVERTISEMENTWhen Macys flagship Herald Square store in New York opened its doors at midnight on Black Friday, about 11,000 shoppers showed up in lines that wrapped around the massive department store. Joan Riedewald, a private aide for the elderly, and her four children ages six to 18 where among them. By that time they showed up to Macys, Riedewalde had already spent about $100 at Toys R Us, which opened at 8 p.m., and planned to spend another $500 at Macys. Her next stop? A nearby Old Navy, which also opened at midnight."I only shop for sales," she said.Retailers were hoping that the earlier openings would draw a group of shoppers who prefer to head to stores after their pumpkin pie rather than go to bed and get up early the next morning. It is unclear how many shoppers would turn out for the midnight openings on Black Friday, but about 17 percent of shoppers said earlier this month that they planned to shop at stores that opened on Thanksgiving, according to an International Council of Shopping Centers-Goldman Sachs survey of 1,000 consumers. Overall, its estimated that sales on Black Friday will be up 3.8 percent to $11.4 billion this year.The earlier hours are an effort by stores to make shopping as convenient as possible for Americans, who they fear wont spend because of economic uncertainty. Many shoppers are worried about high unemployment and a package of tax increases and spending cuts known as the "fiscal cliff" that will take effect in January unless Congress passes a budget deal by then. At the same time, Americans have grown more comfortable shopping on websites such as Amazon.com, where they can get cheaper prices and buy from the comfort of their home or office cubicle.That has put pressure on brick-and-mortar stores, which can make up to 40 percent of their annual revenue during the two-month holiday shopping season, to compete. Thats becoming more difficult: the National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, estimates that overall sales in November and December will rise 4.1 percent this year to $586.1 billion, or about flat with last years growth. But the online part of that is expected to rise 15 percent to $68.4 billion, according to Forrester Research.As a result, brick-and-mortar retailers are trying everything they can to lure consumers into stores by making shopping as easy as possible. Some stores tested the earlier hours last year, but this year more retailers open their doors late on Thanksgiving or earlier on Black Friday. In addition to expanding their hours, many also are offering free layaways and shipping, matching the cheaper prices of online rivals and updating their mobile shopping apps with more information."Every retailer wants to beat everyone else," said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of Americas Research Group, a research firm based in Charleston, S.C. "Shoppers love it."Hardcore holiday shoppers took advantage of the earlier hours. "I ate my turkey dinner and came right here," said Rasheed Ali, a 23-year-old student in New York City who bought a 50-inch Westinghouse TV for $349 and a Singer sewing machine for $50 at a Target in New York City that opened at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving. "Then Im going home and eating more."There were 11 shoppers in a four-tent encampment outside a Best Buy store near Ann Arbor, Mich., in the afternoon on Thanksgiving. The purpose of their wait? A $179 40-inch Toshiba LCD television is worth missing Thanksgiving dinner at home.Jackie Berg, 26, of Ann Arbor, arrived first with her stepson and a friend Wednesday afternoon, seeking three of the televisions. The deal makes the TVs $240 less than their normal price, so Berg says that shell save more than $700."Well miss the actual being there with family, but well have the rest of the weekend for that," she said.Carey Maguire, 33, and her sister Caitlyn Maguire, 21, showed up at Target in East Harlem neighborhood of New York City at 7 p.m. Their goal was to buy several Nooks, which were on sale for $49. But while waiting in line they were also using their iPhone to do some online buying at rival stores."If youre going to spend, I want to make it worth it," said Caitlyn Maguire, a college student, who spent a total of $175 on Amazon.com, Best Buy and Radio Shack during her two-hour wait.While shoppers snagged early deals, some workers were expected to protest the earlier hours. Wal-Mart, the worlds largest retailer, has been one of the biggest targets of protests against holiday hours. Many of Wal-Marts stores are open 24 hours, but the company offered early bird specials that once were reserved for Black Friday at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving instead.The issue is part of a broader campaign against the companys treatment of workers thats being waged by a union-backed group called OUR Walmart, which includes former and current workers. The group is staging demonstrations and walkouts at hundreds of stores on Black Friday.Mary Pat Tifft, a Wal-Mart employee in Kenosha, Wis., who is a member of OUR Walmart, started an online petition on signon.org that has about 34,000 signatures. "This Thanksgiving, while millions of families plan to spend quality time with their loved ones, Wal-Mart associates have been told we will be stocking shelves and preparing sales starting at 8 p.m.," she wrote on the site.Shortly after midnight, OUR Walmart said workers walked off their jobs in stores in Dallas, Miami and Kenosha, Wis., on Thursday. But a spokeswoman for the group did not immediately give numbers on how many workers participated.For their part, retailers say they are giving shoppers what they want. Dave Tovar, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said that the discounter learned from shoppers that they want to start shopping right after Thanksgiving dinner. Then, they want to have time to go to bed before they wake up to head back out to the stores.Still, Tovar said that Wal-Mart works to accommodate its workers requests for different working hours. "We spent a lot of time talking to them, trying to figure out when would be the best time for our events," he said.	2012-11-23

Lew pressed China on Tuesday, May 13, 2014, to ease politically sensitive exchange rate controls and lower barriers to foreign investment. Beijing in March widened the narrow band in which it allows its yuan to fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. But it retained controls that critics complain keep the yuan undervalued and give its exporters an unfair price advantage. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File)The Associated PressBEIJING –  The U.S. treasury secretary pressed China on Tuesday to ease exchange rate controls and lower barriers to trade and investment.Beijing in March widened the narrow band in which it allows its yuan to fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. But it retained controls that critics complain keep the yuan undervalued and give its exporters an unfair price advantage.ADVERTISEMENT"It is important that China demonstrate a renewed commitment to move to a more market-determined exchange rate," Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew told Chinas top economic official, Premier Li Keqiang, in a meeting.Lew appealed for a "more transparent exchange rate policy."Washington wants a more "open, balanced" trade and investment relationship, Lew said. He said that would include opening Chinas markets wider to foreign investment and ensuring equal treatment for all companies.Lew expressed similar sentiments earlier Tuesday in a meeting with a deputy premier, Wang Yang.Also Tuesday, the U.S. government announced that the next meeting of its Strategic and Economic Dialogue with China will be held in July in Beijing. It said the U.S. delegation will be led by Lew and by Secretary of State John Kerry. Wang and State Councilor Yang Jiechi are to lead the Chinese side.The dialogue is aimed at improving cooperation between the worlds two largest economies on political, economic and other issues and to resolve irritants in trade and other areas.In his meeting with Lew, the Chinese premier, Li, said achieving results in the dialogue will "bring benefits to both sides and the world."Communist leaders have promised to give entrepreneurs and market forces a bigger role in Chinas state-dominated economy in hopes of making it more efficient and productive.Li promised in an annual policy speech in March that the market would be allowed to play a "decisive role" in allocating credit and other resources.The March 15 widening of the currency trading band doubled the margin by which the yuan is allowed to fluctuate each day against the dollar, though to a still relatively narrow 2 percent.Beijing reported a $260 billion global trade surplus last year, a $30 billion increase over 2012 and among the largest ever recorded by any country.Chinese leaders have said they plan eventually to let the yuan trade freely on global currency markets but some analysts say that might be decades away.The yuan has been allowed to gain about 20 percent against the dollar since 2005 but this year the central bank has been guiding its value lower. Analysts say that appeared to be an effort to discourage speculators who are moving into China to profit from the currencys rise.Foreign business groups complain Beijing uses regulatory barriers to shield its companies from competition in violation of its free-trading pledges.In a report in March, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said 41 percent of its members that responded to a survey believed foreign companies are "less welcome than before."	2014-05-13

The low rates could give a boost to the spring home-buying season, which has started slowly.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate for a 30-year loan declined to 4.14 percent from 4.20 percent last week. The average for the 15-year mortgage eased to 3.25 percent from 3.29 percent.ADVERTISEMENTWarmer weather has yet to boost home-buying as it normally does. Rising prices and higher rates have made affordability a problem for would-be buyers.U.S home construction surged in April to its highest pace in five months, the government reported last Friday, but nearly all the increase came from the volatile apartment sector — a sign that Americans are still struggling to buy single-family homes.And sales of existing U.S. homes rebounded slightly in April, but the pace of buying remained below last years level, according to data released Thursday by the National Association of Realtors.Home sales and construction have faltered since last fall, slowing economic growth. A harsh winter, higher buying costs and a limited supply of available homes have discouraged many potential buyers.Mortgage rates still are nearly a full percentage point above record lows reached about a year ago. The increase over the year was driven in part by speculation that the Federal Reserve would reduce its bond purchases, which have helped keep long-term interest rates low. Indeed, the Fed has announced four declines in its monthly bond purchases since December because the economy appears to be steadily healing. But the Fed has no plans to raise its benchmark short-term rate from record lows.Fed Chair Janet Yellen has told Congress that the economy is improving but noted that the job market remains "far from satisfactory" and that inflation is still below the Feds target rate. She said she expects the Feds near-zero target for short-term rates to remain appropriate for a "considerable time" after the bond purchases end.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged from a week earlier at 0.6 point. The fee for a 15-year loan declined to 0.5 point from 0.6 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate loan was steady at 2.43 percent. The average fee slipped to 0.4 point from 0.5 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage fell to 2.96 percent from 3.01 percent. The fee held at 0.4 point.	2014-05-22
572	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/13/amid-federal-investigation-coal-exports-at-record-levels/	Amid federal investigation, coal exports at record levels	April 4, 2013: Coal bound for South Korea via a West Coast port passes through a loading terminal at Cloud Peak Energys Spring Creek mine near Decker, Mont.APDECKER, Mont. –  From the time coal is scooped from the depths of the Spring Creek strip mine in Montanas wide-open Powder River Basin until it travels more than 6,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean to power plants in South Korea, the price can increase more than fivefold.Mining companies, however, are only paying government royalties on the price of the coal when it is mined from federal lands, not when it is sold for more overseas, saving them millions of dollars in the process.ADVERTISEMENTAs the Interior Department investigates the industrys export practices and considers a new royalty system, several exporters in the Montana-Wyoming coal region -- the nations most productive -- are planning to increase shipments abroad to energy-hungry Asia.Whatever the department decides on royalties, a matter currently under internal review, the results have the potential to cut into profits at a time when the industry is looking to foreign markets to offset some of the daunting challenges it faces at home.Proposed ports on the West Coast have the potential to increase U.S. coal exports by 60 to 100 million tons a year, said Jim Rollyson, an energy analyst with the advisory firm Raymond James."The international export market is where long-term growth for the industry might come from," Rollyson said. "If youre the government, thats real money youre trying to get there."Federal officials forecast that 175 coal-burning power plant units will be shuttered in the next five years, equal to 8.5 percent of the total electricity produced by coal, largely because of competition from cheap natural gas and costs of complying with new environmental regulations.Overseas markets, by contrast, have been booming.While analysts expect demand to slip temporarily this year, 2012 saw a record 125 million tons of coal exported from the U.S. Some in the industry project that figure could double in just the next five years if new ports and port expansions are built in Washington state, Oregon and the Gulf Coast. Federal officials declined to say what theyve uncovered since the royalties investigation was announced in February. But theyve said the probe will continue under the leadership of recently confirmed Interior Secretary Sally Jewell."We take this issue very seriously and remain fully committed to collecting every dollar due," said Patrick Etchart with Interiors Office of Natural Resource Revenue.Among the major coal producers from federal lands in the West, Peabody Energy and Spring Creek owner Cloud Peak Energy have denied any wrongdoing, while Arch Coal, Inc., has declined to comment.The investigation into the industry follows concerns raised by two prominent U.S. senators -- Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and the committees ranking minority member, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. Theyve warned taxpayers could lose many millions of dollars annually if royalties are unfairly calculated. "Taxpayers deserve to know if Interiors oversight and regulations have kept up" with the rise in exports, said Wyden spokesman Keith Chu.Royalties currently are paid based on the mine price of coal -- about $10.55 a ton in the Powder River Basin, kept low by the volume of coal produced by mines such as Spring Creek, which boasts an 80-foot thick seam of the fuel that extends for miles beneath the surrounding landscape of gently rolling hills dotted with patches of pine.By the time it hits the export market, that same ton of coal can be sold for $60 or more. New filings with securities regulators for the first time shed light on the profitability of Cloud Peaks exports -- what the company refers to as its "logistics business."In the past, that business was lumped in with the companys domestic mining operations. Its now been broken out to capture the transportation costs incurred by an affiliate within the company that "buys" coal from the mine and arranges to deliver it from Montana to overseas customers.The securities filings showed the company earned just over $60 million over the last two years off logistics, most of that from exported coal. Logistics accounted for about 22 percent of the Cloud Peaks 2012 total revenue of $1.5 billion. That portion of the companys profits fall outside royalty calculations.And rightfully so, argue Cloud Peak executives, who say the export market carries far more risk than domestic sales, and the separate line of business shipping through West Coast ports should be excluded from royalties. In 2013, for example, the company said low coal prices could sharply drive down its export earnings. Even if it doesnt move as much coal, the company says its still obligated under rail and port contracts to pay for shipping."Were taking some risk that the good years will outnumber the bad years, but theres no guarantee on that," said Cloud Peak Vice President Jim Orchard.The company adds that its domestic operations remain more profitable, with a profit margin of about 40 percent versus just over 10 percent for its export division. Orchard said the company paid $383 million in taxes to state and federal authorities last year, versus a net income less than half that amount, $173 million.During a recent visit to Spring Creek by an Associated Press reporter, massive mechanized shovels at the bottom of the sprawling mine site scooped up 50 tons of crumbling coal with every pass.They dumped the fuel into the back of huge trucks that lumbered up to ground level, where they tipped the fuel onto conveyor belts, which in turn moved coal chunks as big basketballs into a processing plant where they could be broken into smaller pieces.From there, it was loaded onto a procession of BNSF Railway cars that would deliver the coal more than 1,500 miles to Vancouvers Westshore Terminals, one of the main coal shipping ports on the West Coast. Unlike domestic sales, where the customer pays for delivery, Cloud Peak would cover the cost to get the coal to Westshore.The 260-worker mine is the largest in Montana, and manager Bruce Jones said about a quarter of its production -- just over 4 million tons last year -- now goes into the export market. Thats up from less than one million ton just five years ago.Several industry analysts including Meredith Bandy with BMO Capital Markets in Denver said calculating royalties based on the mine price of coal appeared to be a valid approach under federal law, particularly given high transportation costs for exports.But she added that given the political overtones of the issue "its anybodys guess as to what happens" as the government considers changing royalty rules.	2013-04-13
676	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/11/america-cup-death-latest-patch-rough-waters-for-planners-sailing-biggest-race/	Americas Cup death latest patch of rough waters for planners of sailings biggest race	SAN FRANCISCO –  Olympic gold medal-winning sailor Andrew "Bart" Simpsons death during an Americas Cup training run on San Francisco Bay last week was the latest and most glaring setback to befall an event that had already encountered its share of rough waters.Now, questions are being raised about the safety of the $10 million high-tech boats that can obtain speeds of 45 mph and how Simpsons death will affect his team, Artemis Racing, and the Americas Cup itself. Its unclear if Artemis will compete, as planned, now that one of its two boats has been destroyed.ADVERTISEMENTFrom the moment billionaire Larry Ellison proposed holding the event in San Francisco after winning the trophy in 2010, Americas Cup organizers ran into vocal political opposition, lawsuits and community protests over the public cost of the event to the citys treasury and environment."This is not the first time a bunch of starry eyed politicians have been bamboozled by a tycoon," said former city supervisor Aaron Peskin, who settled his lawsuit last year that sought to stop the event. "Usually when things get hyped that much they turn out to be too good to be true. This was too good to be true."Up to a dozen sailing teams were expected to set up operations for months around the bay, injecting a significant boost to the local economy, but only three competitors showed up to take on the defending cup champions Oracle racing.An accidental fire started by a welder working on Americas Cup improvement caused $2.4 million in damages to a city pier in June 2012 and Team Oracles boat capsized in October and was swept four miles out to sea where it was badly damaged by the churning waters.Critics complain that Americas Cup organizers promised too much to win the backing of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and are now delivering too little. They point to the ratcheting down of the economic forecast as proof.When first proposed, city officials were told the event would mean 8,800 new jobs and $1.4 billion to the local economy. That has been recently revised to $780 million and 5,500 jobs. A private fundraising effort has fallen behind its initial target of raising $32 million to offset the citys expense for hosting the event. Civic leaders were promised the Americas Cup wouldnt cost the city."I wont kid anyone that bringing a large event to San Francisco isnt without its challenges," chief event organizer Stephen Barclay said Friday at a news conference.In an interview Saturday morning, Barclay noted that fundraisers have amassed $14 million in donations and pledges and the $14 million in tax revenue city official expect the event to generate will offset any costs to San Francisco. Barclay said that the city will still end up paying nothing while still benefiting financially from a major sporting event with 50 racing days."The majority of people understand thats why the city pursued the Americas Cup," Barclay said.Barclay said that Simpsons death has stunned the tight-knit sailing community.Nonetheless, he said he has "every expectation" that the Americas Cup will take place as scheduled. But Barclay said he wont commit formally to that position until an internal probe of the fatal crash is completed.Decisions on whether to make safety changes to the boats or the race course along San Franciscos busy waterfront will also await the conclusion of the examination, which is being led by Regatta director Iain Murray, Barclay said. Murray is expected to announce the probable cause of the accident early next week.Artemis chairman Torbjorn Tornqvist said his team will also conduct a thorough review of the accident."(We) will be looking at how the risks inherent to such competitive sailing can be limited in the future for the safety of the team and all competitors in the sailing community," he said.Barclay conceded that organizers were disappointed that only three teams materialized to challenge Oracle Racing, but cited the bad economy as a reason some potential challengers stayed away.He said that the run-up to the London Olympics last year endured massive amounts of criticism and concerns. But he said once the games started, the focus shifted almost entirely to the sporting events and the games were ultimately deemed a success."I have no doubt that will also be the case with the Americas Cup, too," Barclay said. "A light switch will flip."	2013-05-11
909	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/03/20/nj-lt-gov-says-tourism-broke-record-in-13-despite-sandy-contradicting-other/	NJ lt. gov says tourism broke record in 13 despite Sandy, contradicting other reports	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. –  Tourism promoters, business owners and even members of the Christie administration have been saying for months that tourism was down last year as a result of Superstorm Sandy.But 2013 was actually a banner year for New Jersey, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno said Thursday at the states annual tourism conference in Atlantic City.ADVERTISEMENTShe said tourism accounted for $40.4 billion in economic activity last year, topping the previous record of nearly $40 billion set in 2012.Her claim contradicts statements made last month by Michele Brown, the state economic development chief, at hearings on Sandy relief aid. Brown said 2013s tourism numbers were slightly below the 2012 figure."I read it like five times and I asked the people, Are you sure about these numbers?" Guadagno said at the conference in the Golden Nugget Atlantic City. "Thats the first summer after Sandy."Virginia Pellerin, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Authority, said the report Guadagno cited Thursday contains new data that was not available earlier in the year. She also said the tourism data Brown referenced included only the four shore counties, not the entire state.The overall tourism statistics came from a report compiled for the state by Tourism Economics, a subsidiary of the U.K.-based Oxford Economics firm.It said visitor spending increased by 1.3 percent in 2013, and total visitation to New Jersey increased by nearly 6 percent to 87.2 million.Guadagno also said construction of and investment in tourism facilities was up 24 percent last year — not surprising given the amount of damage that needed to be repaired after Sandy and from a devastating boardwalk fire in Seaside Heights and Seaside Park.An informal Associated Press survey of beachfront business owners in Monmouth and Ocean counties just before Labor Day found many reporting sales had fallen by 30 percent in the summer of 2013.Gov. Chris Christie spent the first week in August at the shore with his family, sitting on the beach, playing miniature golf, strolling boardwalks and dining out every night."We knew that this summer was not going to be like the summer of 2012; I said that right from the beginning," he said shortly before Labor Day. "Theres no doubt that business was going to be down all over the Jersey shore because a lot of people, having seen the extraordinary devastation, didnt believe wed be able to be up and running in time for summer. They turned out to be wrong, and I think well get them back next year."Tourism promoters also told a legislative hearing in December that the states "Stronger than the Storm" campaign came too late to save the first post-Sandy summer.The report also asserted that tourism:— Is New Jerseys 5th largest industry.— Generated $35.9 billion of New Jerseys gross domestic product in 2013, or 7 percent of the entire state economy. If New Jersey tourism were a company, its sales would rank No. 70 on the Fortune 500 list — bigger than Sears, DuPont and Hess.— Directly or indirectly supports 511,000 jobs in New Jersey, about 1 out of every 10 jobs in the state.— Generated $4.6 billion in state and local taxes, and $5.2 billion in federal taxes last year.The state plans to launch its new summer tourism campaign, "Going Strong," later this month. It hopes to use $5 million in federal Sandy recovery funds to pay for it.The report also predicted that visitation to New Jersey will increase by 2 percent or more a year in each of the next four years, and that tourism spending will increase by more than 4 percent annually over that same period.___Wayne Parry can be reached at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC	2014-03-20
963	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/03/11/republicans-want-las-vegas-high-speed-rail-spiked/	Republicans want Las Vegas high-speed rail spiked	LOS ANGELES –  Top congressional Republicans want the Obama administration to reject a $5.5 billion loan being sought by a private Nevada company to build a high-speed train from the edge of Californias Mojave Desert to Las Vegas, officials said Monday.The proposed line known as XpressWest is a dicey bet for taxpayers, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Sen. Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said in a letter to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.ADVERTISEMENT"We are deeply troubled by the prospects of subsidizing another costly, wasteful and risky high-speed railproject, particularly when our nation is facing a debt crisis," they wrote in the letter dated March 6.In a response to the lawmakers Monday, XpressWest CEO Anthony Marnell II defended the project that would connect Las Vegas with the small city of Victorville, Calif. He called it a jobs-engine that would ease congested freeways and jump-start a new generation of speedy trains.He told Ryan, of Wisconsin, and Sessions, of Alabama, the company would tap into a little-used pot of railfunding to cover much of the construction cost, with the rest covered by private dollars."There is no more worthy rail transportation ... project in the United States," Marnell wrote.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has been among the trains most outspoken supporters. A statement emailed by spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said "we shouldnt allow tea party-driven ideology to limit much-needed investments in our infrastructure that create thousands of direct and indirect jobs."The vast park-and-ride project hinges on the untested idea that car-loving Californians will drive about 100 miles from the Los Angeles area, pull off the busy Interstate 15 and board a train for the final leg to the famous Strip.Planners imagine that millions of travelers a year will one day flock to a station outside down-on-its-luck Victorville, which was hit hard in the recession.The project had moved steadily through a series of regulatory hurdles and company officials expected a decision last year, which didnt happen.The Associated Press last year reported that the companys own research warns its difficult to predict how many people will ride the train, a critical measure of financial survival. Reid and other supporters point to research that shows 80,000 new jobs, but government documents show virtually all those would be temporary — no more than 722 would be permanent, AP found.Marnell is a casino developer and contractor whose credits include building the Bellagio and Wynn Las Vegas. He told the lawmakers the companys ridership study "clearly supports our financing structure and the viability of this project."Ryan and Sessions also asked the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to assess the risk to taxpayers. They urged the administration to postpone a decision on the loan until a GAO review of the project is complete.	2013-03-11
994	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/03/19/saving-enough-for-retirement-study-finds-lack-confidence-persists-despite/	Saving enough for retirement? Study finds lack of confidence persists, despite market rebound	Workers appear to have little faith that the economic recovery and the stock markets climb have left them better-prepared for retirement.Confidence in the ability to afford a comfortable retirement remains at the same record low level recorded in 2011, and is slightly lower than last year, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, which has conducted the study the past 23 years.ADVERTISEMENTNearly half of workers surveyed in January had little or no confidence that theyll have a financially comfortable retirement, EBRI said Tuesday. Twenty-eight percent were not at all confident — the highest level recorded since the survey began in 1991 — with 21 percent saying they were not too confident.About 13 percent were very confident and 38 percent somewhat confident, figures that werent substantially greater than the record lows in the 2011 survey.If theres any positive takeaway, its that researchers believe workers who are the least prepared for retirement have become increasingly aware that they need to save more.In 2007, for example, confidence numbers were substantially higher before the economy sank into a recession. Seventy percent were either somewhat confident or very confident that year.The decline in confidence in recent years suggests "a much higher degree of realism" about the need to increase savings rates, said Jack VanDerhei, EBRIs research director, and co-author of the report.That could explain why confidence remains low, despite the economys gains since the recession and a market rally that lifted the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high two weeks ago.Despite the realization that theyre not saving enough, short-term financial needs are so pressing that long-term goals become secondary."Job security and financial security continue to be Americans major concerns, not retirement," VanDerhei said.In addition to worrying about their retirement savings, workers "lack confidence in their ability to pay for medical expenses, and even basics such as food, clothing and shelter," he said.The survey was co-sponsored by EBRI, a private nonprofit research organization, and Matthew Greenwald & Associates, a market research firm. Two-dozen public and private organizations, including financial services companies, provided funding. About 1,000 U.S. workers aged 25 and older and 250 retirees were randomly chosen for telephone interviews in January. The statistical margin of error is plus or minus 3 percent.The researchers concluded that fewer than half of workers appear to be taking basic steps needed to prepare for retirement. For example, 46 percent of those surveyed reported that they or their spouse had tried to estimate how much theyll need to save by retirement to ensure that they could live comfortably. The rest made no such calculation.Two percent of workers and 4 percent of retirees said that saving or planning for retirement was the most pressing financial issue that most Americans face. Both groups were most likely to identify job uncertainty as the most pressing concern (30 percent of workers and 27 percent of retirees) followed by meeting day-to-day needs (12 percent for each group).Participants cited the cost of living and daily expenses as the key reasons why workers either dont contribute to workplace savings plans such as 401(k)s or dont contribute enough.Fifty-five percent of workers and 39 percent of retirees reported having a problem with their debt levels. About half said they could definitely come up with $2,000 if an unexpected need arose within the next month.	2013-03-19
1020	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/09/17/oracle-boeing-leaders-tout-expansion-in-mont-say-it-makes-sense-to-return-jobs/	Oracle, Boeing leaders tout expansion in Mont., say it makes sense to return jobs to US	HELENA, Mont. –  Business leaders from Oracle Corp., Ford Motor Co. and The Boeing Co. said Tuesday their companies have found that it makes sense to bring jobs back to the United States — even to smaller cities in places such as Montana.Oracle President Safra Catz, speaking to a gathering of several thousand business leaders and others at a jobs summit in Butte, said her company has been centering its cloud computing division in the nearby mountain town of Bozeman.ADVERTISEMENTThe company has found that cheaper labor isnt always worth it and has brought some jobs back from Mexico to the U.S., she said."It is really, really simple: Employees are our company," Catz said. "Everything of value that we are is coming from, and in, the heads of our people."Oracle purchased a Bozeman software firm in 2011. Catz said Oracle has been impressed with the result, plans to continue expanding, and expects it will attract more technology companies to the area."What is wonderful about Montana is that I know I have great people, and I dont have to worry about civil war breaking out," Catz said. "I know that sounds funny, but I have civil war in some of my countries."Boeing CEO Jim McNerney told the crowd that locating workers outside the country is no longer as compelling as the cost of business increases overseas.Boeing has had mixed results on outsourcing jobs overseas. Some critics have blamed production delays on the companys decision to offshore critical components.McNerney predicted that improved business efficiency and innovation, fast-paced energy development that could make the country the worlds largest oil producer, and other factors are going to lead to a renaissance of American manufacturing. He said an effect of the recession is companies produce more with less."The long-term upside for workers is that American companies are about as well positioned as they have in decades to compete and win on a global scale," McNerney said.He pointed out that wages overseas have been increasing.The CEO announced a $35 million expansion for Boeings Helena, Mont., plant that will add as many as 25 jobs at a facility that specializes in making critical airplane parts. He thanked U.S. Sen. Max Baucus, who introduced Boeing leaders to the local plant that the larger company purchased in 2010, for helping make the latest expansion possible.Baucus organized the Butte jobs conference.Alan Mulally, CEO of Ford, said its company invested heavily during the recession in revamping and modernizing a more fuel efficient car line.

1099	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/09/12/us-homes-entering-foreclosure-process-slowed-to-near-8-year-low-in-august/	US homes entering foreclosure process slowed to near 8-year low in August	LOS ANGELES –  Lenders initiated foreclosure action in August against the fewest U.S. homes for any month in nearly eight years, a trend that should help reduce the number of homes lost to foreclosure in the months ahead.Some 55,775 homes entered the foreclosure process last month, a decline of 8 percent from July and down 44 percent from August last year, foreclosure listing firm RealtyTrac Inc. said Thursday.ADVERTISEMENTThe national slowdown in foreclosure starts reflects an improving housing market, steady job growth and fewer troubled loans dating back to the pre-housing bubble days.While the risk of foreclosure remains elevated in several states, including Florida, Nevada and Ohio, the pace of homes starting on the foreclosure path has been declining nationally in concert with the housing market rebound.At their current pace, RealtyTrac expects monthly foreclosure starts to fall to around 52,000 a month early next year. Thats the pace the company considers normal."Were not quite there, but almost there," said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac.Foreclosure starts fell on an annual basis last month in 38 states, including Colorado, Arizona, Washington and California. They increased on a monthly basis in 17 states, including Nevada, Ohio and New York, the firm said.All told, foreclosure starts have declined on an annual basis the past 13 months, aided by rising home values, which make it easier for homeowners who may have been in negative equity, or owed more than their home was worth, to refinance or sell their home.Some 7.1 million homes, or 14.5 percent of all U.S. homes with a mortgage, were in negative equity at the end of the second quarter, according to data provider CoreLogic. Thats down from 9.6 million, or 19.7 percent of homes with a mortgage, in the previous three months.Through the first half of this year, nearly 3.5 million homeowners have returned to positive equity, CoreLogic said.While fewer homes are entering the foreclosure process, lenders have stepped up home repossessions in recent months.Completed foreclosures rose 6 percent last month versus July, the third monthly increase in four months.Much of the increase came about in states where courts oversee the foreclosure process. Those courts were backed up with cases two years ago, but have been making progress working through their backlog.The number of homes taken back by banks last month climbed on an annual basis in 23 states, including New York, Florida and New Jersey, but was down 25 percent nationally, RealtyTrac said.As Aug. 31, there were about 1.3 million homes in some stage of foreclosure or owned by banks, down about 5 percent from a year earlier.Completed foreclosures are now on track to finish the year at 490,000, down about 26 percent from 2012s total, Blomquist said.Foreclosures peaked in 2010 at 1.05 million and have been declining ever since. The trend has been accelerating as U.S. home prices have increased and the job market has improved.Blomquist expects foreclosures nationally will reach a normal level around the first quarter of 2015.It could take a bit longer in states like Nevada, which topped the nation last month with a foreclosure rate of more than two and a half times the national average.RealtyTrac measures foreclosure rate by tallying the number of homes that receive a foreclosure-related filing, such as an initial default notices or a notice of scheduled auction.Florida clocked in last month with the second-highest foreclosure rate in the nation, followed by Ohio, Maryland and Delaware to round out the top five.	2013-09-12

But the extra pennies shell earn in 2013 will add up over the coming weeks and months.ADVERTISEMENT"Its not much, but its something," said Olson, 16, who works at Wagners European Bakery and Cafe in Olympia. "Every bit helps."Many workers around the country wont be as lucky as the ones in Washington state, which is raising its salary minimum even though it already has the highest state baseline in the country. Workers one state over — in Idaho — will make nearly $2 per hour less in 2013.Automatic minimum wage increases designed to compensate for inflation have steadily pushed up salaries in some states, even through the recession, expanding the pay gap between areas that make annual adjustments and those that dont. Of the 10 states that will increase the minimum wage Tuesday, nine did so automatically to adjust for inflation.Rhode Island lawmakers approved that states wage increase this past year.Paul Sonn, legal co-director at the National Employment Law Project, said he hopes more states will start looking at automatic adjustments as the economy recovers. He said the model — which Washington state first adopted in 1998 — helps avoid sudden jolts as states try to catch up to their peers."We think theres a case that its better for everyone, including the business community, to have predictable, regular, small increases every year," Sonn said.The automatic adjustments arent much. Washingtons bump of 15 cents will mean those who work 40-hour weeks will earn an extra $6 per week — enough for a couple lattes — or about $300 per year.Hundreds of thousands of workers are expected to get a pay increase with the wage adjustments that begin New Years Day. Along with Washington and Rhode Island, the changes will also occur in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, and Vermont.Between the nine states with automatic adjustments happening this year, the average minimum wage is $8.12 per hour, up from a little under $8. States that do not have automatic changes operate with an average minimum wage of about $7.40 — a difference of about $1,500 per year for a full-time worker.Many states, including Idaho, follow the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, either because theyve tied their minimum wage to that threshold or because the state-enacted minimum is lower than that.San Francisco has set the highest local minimum wage and will have workers paid at least $10.55 an hour in 2013.Groups like the National Restaurant Association oppose further increases in federal or state minimum wages, arguing that its an ineffective way to reduce poverty and forces business owners to cut hours, raise prices or lay off workers.At Toms 1st Avenue Bento, a downtown Portland lunch spot, owner Tom Hume said he boosted pay for minimum-wage workers before the end of the year in order to get ahead of the game. He also raised prices on one-third of his menu items by 25 cents.Natasha Baker, 22, who works at Humes restaurant, recently moved back in with her mother but hopes to move to another apartment in January. She said the extra $5 or $6 shes earning every week with the salary boost is OK but wont make a huge difference."I dont usually look at what I get paid," she said. "Im more directed on whats being taken out, which is more discouraging than anything."___AP Writer Steven Dubois contributed to this report from Portland.

That is still below the record price of $4.11 at the pump just after July 4, 2008.ADVERTISEMENTThe continuing fears over the political unrest in Iraq have seen crude oil prices rising, causing an unseasonably early summer run-up on retail gas prices, the paper reports.According to GasBuddy.com, as of Sunday, South Carolina drivers were paying the least amount for gas, $3.37 a gallon, while Hawaii motorists were shelling out the most at the pump -- $4.37 a gallon for regular.Tom Kloza, senior energy analyst for GasBuddy.com, expects a $3.75 top, and says gas prices may be near their 2014 peak.“Demand during the summer looks to be brisk, but it will be hard-pressed to match last year’s consumption rate. Year-to-date, U.S. motor fuel demand has averaged about 365 million gallons per day, up about 1.7 percent from the same period in 2013,” Kloza told USA Today. “But lower demand looms through most of 2014 thanks to less driving by Millennials and an increasingly more efficient light-vehicle fleet.” 	2014-06-29

The sand is 99.5 percent pure silica, ADVERTISEMENT“This sand has excellent chemical properties, very low iron, very low aluminum,” said William McTee, regional manager for Unimin corporation, a company that’s been mining sand around the country for decades.The special sand is sold to the hydraulic fracking industry for use as a proppant in the drilling process, which forces fossil fuels from deep within the earth. When the hydraulic pressure is relieved from the well, the sand is pumped into the well to hold open the small fractures in the rock while allowing oil and gas to pass up to the surface.Sand and water are used in that process and the particular sand in the Midwest is the best the industry can get. Its smooth round shape makes it “act like BBs, letting oil and gas pass through” McTee said. \n \nWith horizontal drilling, even more sand is needed because the borings travel extend farther. Thats made the ultra pure Ottawa White sand became much more valuable. As a result, nearly a dozen companies set up shop to mine for sand among the farmlands in La Salle County, Ill., Tunnel City, Wisc., and places in Minnesota and wherever the sand is found.Neighbors had mixed reactions. For those struggling to find work it was a blessing.  And some farmers have been able to cash in by selling their land to mining companies at high profit.\n \n“The demand for this high quality sand is revitalizing these communities, its bringing jobs back, it’s bringing families back, and it’s putting a paycheck in the pocket of many people that didn’t have one,” said Phil Flynn, an energy analyst for The Price Group, in Chicago. \n \nBut others, like Mary and Monty Whipple, of LaSalle County, Ill., worry that farmland is disappearing from America’s heartland.“Farmland will last into infinity with good stewardship of the ground," Mary Whipple said. "Mining is finite. People can’t eat sand or drink oil.” \n \nNorthwestern University environmental attorney Nancy Loeb said she’s not necessarily concerned about sand mining per se, she’s concerned about where and how it’s being done.“What they’re doing is a very short term infusion of money to a limited number of people in these towns, but the farmland is gone forever," Loeb said.\n \nSixty-two-year-old Larry Flynn’s family has been farming since the 1800’s."Ive got cattle and horses and corn and beans and alfalfa," he said.\n \nHe’s also now got a “for sale” sign posted on the edge of his property in Utica, Ill.\n \n“We really dont want to sell but with these sand mines, Ive got one to the south of me and they bought some ground to the west,” Flynn said. “Im going to be like a little island in the sand mines.” \n \nBut Flynn thinks he can sell his land for $50,000 an acre, which takes some of the sting out of the deal.Financially-strapped towns are also figuring out that a lot of money can be made by annexing land and selling it to sand mining companies. Those towns often also share in the company’s profits.  As a result, residents see a reduction in their taxes.\n \n“It’s not only the financial benefits that you see from a tax point of view, it’s the jobs we create and it’s the ancillary jobs that are created by us doing business in the area,” McTee said.\n \nAnd those jobs could be around for a long time. Some estimates report there’s enough sand in the Midwest to mine for at least 25 years. Sand has become the newest cash crop.	2014-06-26

The report illustrates the potential fallout for communities whose economy is closely linked to military facilities.For example, the report says Fort Campbell Fort on the Kentucky-Tennessee line would lose half its civilian and military workforce — about 16,000 people — and take an economic hit of $863 million.	2014-07-03

But the ADP numbers cover only private businesses and often diverge from the governments more comprehensive report.The improvement in the ADP figures occurred mostly in professional and business services, a category that includes many higher-paying jobs such as accountants and engineers, but also lower-paid temporary workers. That category gained 77,000 jobs.Goods producers hired 51,000 workers in May, up from 31,000 the previous month.	2014-07-02

454	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/05/27/states-warn-consumers-about-possible-insurance-gaps-with-rideshare-companies/	States warn consumers about possible insurance gaps with rideshare companies	A dozen states have warned consumers about potential insurance problems with so-called “ridesharing companies,” saying it is unclear who is on the hook when drivers dispatched by firms like Uber, Sidecar and Lyft get into accidents.Idaho was the latest state to warn consumers about potential insurance gaps in the new industry, which uses apps to help drivers find fares and customers find rides. Although the companies say they are not the drivers’ employers, and simply take a cut from the fares, that claim may not survive litigation.ADVERTISEMENT“Potential gaps in insurance coverage for both drivers and passengers is concerning,” said Idaho Department of Insurance Director Bill Deal.Passengers of the companies must agree to hold the companies harmless for anything that happens on the trip, according to waivers. But if a driver dispatched by one of the companies causes a serious accident and does not have insurance, it is unclear who is liable. An injured rider may not be covered, they say.The companies claim they are simply tech companies that facilitate rides and fares and are protected by the Communications Decency Act. The drivers they work with do not appear to be their employees, and, like all motorists, are required to have insurance.But in a serious or even fatal accident involving millions of dollars of damages, the companies could be targeted by lawsuits. Already, one such suit is targeting Uber as well as a driver whose policy has a $750,000 limit. In that case, a private taxi driver, considered by Uber to be a "partner," not an employee, collided with another car in San Francisco in a wreck that sent a fire hydrant flying through the air. The woman the hydrant struck was badly injured and is suing.According to Uber officials, the company has created an insurance plan that will pay up to $2 million per accident for cases involving its “peer-to-peer” plan, in which ordinary folks are matched up with others who need rides.  Lyft and Sidecar have $1 million policies.Uber officials, in a post on the company’s site, said they vet drivers to ensure they have safe records and adequate coverage.“From the time a driver accepts a trip request through our app until the completion of the ride, our partners have $1 million of coverage for driver liability,” read the statement. “We were also the first ridesharing request service to include $1 million of coverage for uninsured/underinsured motorists, meaning that passengers and drivers are also covered for injuries when another party is at fault and lacks sufficient insurance.”Still, in lawsuits like the one involving the fire hydrant, Uber claims it is not liable for an accident caused by a driver it dispatched. Critics say the companies are no more insulated from lawsuits than owners of taxi cabs or even pizza chains whose drivers cause accidents.“Uber is trying to distance itself from any liability, instead calling itself a "modern day phone book" of drivers that simply connect people but has no responsibility when accidents occur,” the San Francisco-based personal injury firm of Bostwick & Peterson states in a message on its web site. “However, because Uber does connect people legal analysts assert that it should be treated more like a taxi company and be held responsible for risks Uber creates.”California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island and Tennessee have all previously warned consumers that they could potentially face liability for accidents cause by drivers they hire.	2014-05-27
501	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/04/06/here-are-5-signs-that-us-job-market-may-finally-be-accelerating-after-brutal/	Here are 5 signs that the US job market may finally be accelerating after a brutal winter	WASHINGTON –  Few people responded to the March jobs report with high-fives and cheers. But there may be reasons to applaud in the months ahead.Hiring in March was close to the economic recoverys steady but hardly explosive monthly average of the past two years: 192,000 added jobs. The unemployment rate remained 6.7 percent for a second straight month, according to the governments report Friday.ADVERTISEMENTThat wasnt the blockbuster figure predicted by some economists, who figured hiring would take off in March after a winter when factory orders, home sales and auto buying were slowed by severe weather.Yet tucked into the March jobs report and other recent indicators were hints of stronger job growth ahead:Hiring over the past 12 months has outpaced population growth. More workers in the prime 25- to 54-year-old age group are finding jobs. The winter freeze was less destructive to hiring than had been assumed. Layoffs have declined since February. And an increase in hours worked suggest that incomes will rise.Here are five signs that the U.S. job market may finally be picking up :JOB GROWTH VS. POPULATION GROWTHFor much of the recovery, the economy suffered from a fundamental problem: We were adding more people than jobs.Employers hired 2.4 million people in 2012. That sounds decent. But its less impressive when you consider this: The working-age population swelled by 3.8 million that year, according to the employment reports survey of households. A similar gap existed in 2013.The share of the population with jobs — the so-called employment-population ratio — ended both 2012 and 2013 at 58.6 percent. That was down sharply from 63 percent before the recession started in late 2007.But encouragingly, the trend reversed itself in March: About 2.35 million people were hired over the preceding 12 months. That was slightly more than the rise in population over the same period. The employment-population ratio ticked up to 58.9 percent, its highest level since August 2009.When an economy adds fewer jobs than people, it loses some ability to accelerate. The economy is carrying more weight and less muscle.Some of this reflects an aging population: More baby boomers are retiring. But another factor is that some people who hunkered down at colleges during the recession have emerged with new degrees and brighter career prospects. And theyve started to look for jobs.Can the gains continue? Tough to say. But were faring better than we should considering that the vast baby boom generation has begun to retire.PRIME-AGE WORKERS ARE RETURNINGAfter the Great Recession ended in mid-2009, a declining share of 25- to 54-year-olds were working. Roughly 80 percent of this age bracket had been employed before the downturn. The figure sank as low as 74.8 percent toward the end of 2010.But it recovered in March to 76.7 percent, the best reading since February 2009."People have gone back to get training and educated and will be more aggressive" and "possibly getting better-paying jobs," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.WEVE ESCAPED WINTERPerhaps the snow trapped your car on an Atlanta freeway. Or maybe you coped with chronic school closings in Philadelphia. Maybe flight cancellations delayed your business meeting to sign a big contract.Were still figuring out how badly the snowstorms disrupted the economy. But hiring never succumbed to the freezing temperatures as much as economists had feared. Revised figures show that 197,000 jobs were added in February and 144,000 in January — a combined 37,000 more than initially estimated.Other corners of the economy are emerging from hibernation. Auto sales, for example, rose 6 percent to 1.5 million vehicles in March after dismal figures the previous two months.FEWER PINK SLIPSThe jobs report provides a "net" figure. The 192,000 jobs that employers added in March results from a simple equation: Jobs filled minus jobs cut. The government calculates the total number of jobs compared with the previous month, while accounting for seasonal variations.So when companies lay off few workers, the net jobs figure should rise. And layoffs have indeed declined. The government reports weekly on applications for unemployment benefits. These applications are proxies for layoffs. During March, 71,000 people fewer people sought benefits than in February.LONGER HOURSThe average workweek rose to 34.5 hours from 34.3 hours in February. That doesnt seem like much — just 12 minutes more. But those extra minutes help boost incomes, Deutsche Bank economist Joseph LaVorgna said in a research note. Hourly workers are taking home more pay over the course of a week — about $17 more than they did at this time last year.Judging from tax receipts, thats having "a significant impact on household income creation," LaVorgna said. And consumer spending is the lifeblood of growth, accounting for about 70 percent of the economy.Higher incomes should fuel spending. Economists are already citing the auto sales as a sign of more robust spending to come. Based on Marchs "strong auto sales, this seems to be providing plenty of firepower for discretionary consumer spending," said Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse.	2014-04-06

Industrial companies such as General Electric, Honeywell and Caterpillar, which make expensive equipment that other companies need to buy in order to grow, have been posting strong results in recent weeks and telling investors that orders are strong. (AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)The Associated PressNEW YORK –  Companies are finally starting to spend some of the cash theyve been sitting on, and that could mean a stronger economy and more jobs are on the way.Industrial companies such as General Electric, Honeywell and Caterpillar have been posting strong financial results in recent weeks and telling investors that orders are strong. That means other large companies are investing in expensive equipment they need to grow their business, economists say.ADVERTISEMENT"Were on the brink of that inflection point where the economy can really take off," says Diane Jaffee, a portfolio manager and managing director at the Trust Company of the West. "Whats different now is that the industrial companies are saying there is real demand."In the years since the Great Recession, big manufacturers have cut costs, slimmed down their operations, and accumulated cash. Theyve had to because their customers — other big businesses — were too worried about some part of the global economy to hire people or buy equipment that takes years to pay off.Political wrangling in the U.S. shut down the government and led the country to nearly default on its debt — more than once — even as the U.S. economy was struggling to improve. At the same time, the enormous European economy was mired in a debt crisis and a subsequent recession.Now, finally, the economies of the U.S. and Europe are showing steady progress, and while Chinese growth appears to be slowing, it remains strong."U.S. gets a little bit better every day. Europe is improving. The growth markets continue to expand and will provide growth during the year even with volatility," General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt told investors last week.GEs results reflected that growth. Revenue from its existing industrial divisions rose 8 percent in the quarter, an extremely strong performance, led by a 12 percent rise in equipment sales. And customers placed some large orders. For example, the South African rail company Transnet ordered 233 locomotives, valued at $700 million, and Air France ordered $1.7 billion worth of aircraft engines. That equipment will be manufactured in the U.S.Caterpillar reported Thursday that its first-quarter earnings rose 5 percent and it raised its forecast for profit for the year despite difficult times in the mining industry. Its sales to construction, energy and transportation companies improved and CEO Doug Oberhelman told investors the U.S. economy looks promising.Honeywells results were boosted by sales of turbochargers for car engines. It cited strong growth in the U.S., China, India and the Middle East as it raised its outlook for the year."Many companies are just more confident in the business climate this year than they were last year," says Jim Russell, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.Concerns that the frigid winter would set the economy back have all but dissipated. It certainly hurt, but things seem to have snapped back quickly.Jaffee, of Trust Company of the West, visited the Port of Albany this week to get some insight into how the economy was moving and said she was "shocked — in a positive way" to learn that the shipments so far this year were outpacing shipments from late last year, despite the cold temperatures.The Commerce Department reported Thursday that demand for core capital goods, considered a good guide for business investment plans, rose 2.2 percent in March after a 1.1 percent drop in February. It was the best showing since November.Last years 30 percent increase in the stock market made shareholders richer, but it didnt help people find work or boost the wages of those who did have jobs. Thats because the increase was largely driven by monetary policy that made cash easy to come by and corporate cost-cutting, and not so much by fast-growing companies or a blossoming economy.Economists dont expect explosive global or corporate growth this year, either. But the improving big economies of the U.S. and Europe will likely inspire companies to further increase spending on high-priced equipment. That kind of spending and hiring go hand-in-hand because both are needed to grow businesses. And it leads to even further economic growth as people with more permanent jobs and higher wages feel confident enough to spend money on their own big-ticket items, such as houses and cars."This year, the momentum shifts to Main Street," said Russell. "The economy for real people will improve."Jonathan Fahey can be reached at http://twitter.com/JonathanFahey .	2014-04-24

Profit beat the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, though revenue missed slightly and the companys stock fell in midday trading.Company executives sketched a picture of a mixed global economy and a U.S. consumer suffering from the payroll tax hike that took effect in January. The results showed stronger growth outside the U.S. than at home, with purchases in Asia, the Middle East and Africa growing the most.ADVERTISEMENTThe Purchase, N.Y., company does business all over the world, and its results are a window into how people are spending — and how theyre feeling about the economy — on all different income levels.In the U.S., consumer spending was relatively strong in January after a weak holiday season, MasterCard executives said. But it slowed in February and March, and MasterCard leaders guessed that was because consumers were registering the effect of the higher payroll taxes, a result of negotiations over the federal budget in Washington.The U.S. economy in the first quarter "was definitely very choppy," MasterCard Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said in an interview with The Associated Press. She expects the current quarter to be muted as well."We have still a very high unemployment rate, housing is just starting to get better, all the discussion in Washington about the fiscal debt — that makes people feel uncomfortable," Hund-Mejean said. "So there are a number of things that are not resolved."CEO Ajay Banga said he was pleased that the first-quarter results met the companys own expectations, despite the "challenging economic conditions." He said U.S. consumers had also been hurt in the first quarter by high prices for food and gas, as well as winter storms in March.Sterne Agee analyst Greg Smith described the quarter as "a slow start," with some measures of revenue lighter than he expected. Overall, though, results were in line with expectations, Smith said in a note to clients. A lower-than-expected tax rate helped, and he noted that the year-ago quarter was particular strong, meaning the company had a tough comparison to meet.MasterCard is trying to elbow its bigger rival Visa out of the way for market share in the debit card business, but Visa has stepped up efforts to regain lost ground. Spending on MasterCard-branded debit cards rose more than spending on credit and charge cards.MasterCard is also focusing on developing countries, where most transactions are still done in cash. The company has been expanding in the region that includes Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and signed an agreement to "explore opportunities" in China.Purchases in Asia, the Middle East and Africa grew 20 percent over the year measured in U.S. dollars, 13 percent in Europe and almost 11 percent in Latin America. In the U.S., growth was just 4 percent.MasterCard earned $766 million in the first three months of the year, up 12 percent from the same period a year ago, the company reported Wednesday. That worked out to $6.23 per share, beating the $6.18 per share expected, on average, by analysts polled by FactSet.Revenue rose 8 percent to $1.9 billion, slightly less than the $1.93 billion forecast by financial analysts who follow the company.MasterCards stock fell $13.11, or 2.4 percent, to close at $539.82 Wednesday. Shares have traded between $389.90 and $552.93 in the past 52 weeks, and are up about 10 percent since the start of the year.	2013-05-01
687	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/09/04/former-nfl-players-say-concussion-settlement-doesnt-stop-questions-end-nfl/	Former NFL players say concussion settlement doesnt stop questions, end of NFLs legal battle	The NFLs concussion settlement may not have settled anything.On Wednesday, two former Super Bowl champions — Troy Aikman and John Lynch, now Fox Sports broadcasters — contended the league has more work to do.ADVERTISEMENTAikman wants the NFL to divulge more details about what it knew regarding the long-term impact of repeated blows to the head, and when it knew it. Lynch said he expects even more litigation after the league tentatively agreed last week to pay out $765 million to a group of former players."What Im happy about is that there are players that need it (the money) and need it now, and theyre going to be taken care of," Lynch said. "But I think the notion that this is done now and we can move on is not really the reality. A new lawsuit was filed today, and from talking with Scott (Fujita) I think there are more to come."It wasnt immediately clear which lawsuit Lynch was referring to, though one was filed Sunday in New Orleans. Former NFL players Jimmy Williams, Rich Mauti, Jimmy Keyes and Nolan Franz claim the league hid information about the dangers of brain injury.While neither Lynch nor Aikman were part of the original lawsuit, both know a thing or two about concussions.Lynch was one of the leagues hardest hitting safeties in Tampa Bay and Denver from 1993 through 2007. Though Lynch has said he was never officially diagnosed with a concussion, he told a Tampa columnist in 2011 that there were times he was "woozy" and asked a teammate to take his spot closer to the line of scrimmage while he recovered.Aikman won three Super Bowls with the Cowboys during the 1990s, but his 12-year career ended prematurely in part because of repeated concussions.Today, Lynch and Aikman say they feel "great" and have shown no symptoms of long-term damage.In fact, Aikman said he recently was tested in Dallas. Doctors, Aikman said, told him Tuesday that the tests were all clear.While Aikman believes the settlement will help the former players with the most immediate need, he called the settlement a "win" for the NFL."Its a lot of money, but I think in terms of what could have been paid, its not that much," Aikman said. "I think probably in the big scheme of things, its a real positive. These guys will be able to benefit some and some money will be put into research, which will help. The one thing Im disappointed about is that the NFL didnt have to acknowledge what they knew about (the long-term impact) and when they knew about it. I think full disclosure would have been the best way to go, but thats not going to happen now."If Lynch is right, perhaps the league will be forced into divulging more details.Until then, the two will continue calling games on Fox Sports, where they have a new teammate in Randy Moss. The former receiver has rarely held his tongue, which is exactly what Fox executives wanted."Hes being himself," Fox Sports executive producer John Entz said. "Hes being very natural and organic, which is what we love about him."Moss acknowledged that he hasnt settled on a style, and he may show a certain penchant for teams he played with during his career. When asked to pick which NFC North team he thought would pose the biggest challenge to Green Bays reign, he first said he was "biased" before blurting out the expected: The Minnesota Vikings.And like the eccentric receiver who started his career in Minnesota, Moss didnt mince words, noting the two most important positions in football are quarterback and running back."Im just excited to have something different in my life and something that I do know about is football," he said. "Theres not too many things I do know about, but I do know football."While he does seem to have an answer for everything, there is one exception. He doesnt want to talk about concussions."I have no comment on it. I know its a serious issue," he said. "But I didnt have anything, and I dont want anything to do with it."___AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org	2013-09-04
910	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/09/fewer-us-homes-entered-foreclosure-path-or-got-repossessed-in-april-scheduled/	Fewer US homes entered foreclosure path or got repossessed in April; scheduled auctions rose	LOS ANGELES –  Fewer U.S. homes entered the foreclosure process or were repossessed by lenders last month, the latest indication that the nations foreclosure woes are waning.Nationally, home repossessions fell 20 percent in April from the previous month and were down 32 percent from a year earlier, foreclosure listing firm RealtyTrac Inc. said Thursday.ADVERTISEMENTForeclosure starts, the initial step in the process that can eventually lead to a home being foreclosed upon, dipped 4 percent last month from March and tumble 28 percent from April last year, the firm said.Even so, homes scheduled for auction in states where the courts play a role in the foreclosure process hit the highest level in more than two years.Most homes lined up for public auction end up going back to lenders, which opens the door for the properties to be placed on the market as sharply discounted foreclosed homes.Still, the prospect that a flurry of those homes set for auction last month will end up on the market is good news for the housing market, said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac.Thats because the rebound in housing over the past year has been fueled in part by rising home values amid a lagging supply of available properties for sale."More foreclosed homes for sale should help fan the flames of a housing recovery by providing more inventory for buyers and investors to purchase," Blomquist said. He added that he doesnt anticipate home prices will dip again when those homes hit the market.Steady job growth and ultra-low mortgage rates are helping the once-battered housing market recover, spurring more people to buy homes.U.S. home prices rose 10.5 percent in March compared to a year earlier, the biggest gain since March 2006, according to real estate data provider CoreLogic. March marked the 13th month in a row that home prices have increased on an annual basis nationwide.Rising home values make it easier for borrowers to refinance their mortgages or sell their homes if they lose their jobs or otherwise become unable to make payments, increasing the chance they will avert foreclosure.All told, 70,133 homes started on the foreclosure path last month.Some 22 states posted an increase in foreclosure starts from March to April, including New Jersey, Connecticut, Texas, California and Georgia.Homes scheduled for auction rose 6 percent in April from the previous month, but declined 20 percent versus April last year, RealtyTrac said.Fifteen out of the 26 states where the courts sign off on foreclosures posted an annual increase in scheduled home auctions. Among them: Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio and Florida, the firm said.On the tail end of the foreclosure process, lenders repossessed 34,997 U.S. homes last month, the lowest level since July 2007.Most of the states saw an annual decline, but some bucked the trend, including Washington, Maryland, Oklahoma and Ohio.At the current monthly pace, completed foreclosures will hit over a half million this year, Blomquist estimated.That would be down from 671,000 last year.At the state level, Nevada had the highest foreclosure rate in the nation, with one in every 360 households in some stage of foreclosure, or more than twice the national average.Rounding out the top 10 states by foreclosure rate were Florida, Ohio, Illinois, South Carolina, Connecticut, Maryland, Georgia, Delaware and Arizona.	2013-05-09

Payday loans, check cashing and digital currency exchanges were among the possibilities outlined in the Jan. 27 report.ADVERTISEMENT“The Office of Inspector General is not suggesting that the Postal Service become a bank or openly compete with banks,” the paper’s executive summary reads. “To the contrary, we are suggesting that the Postal Service could greatly complement banks’ offerings.”The 27-page document also notes that as the country moves toward a cashless economy, the Postal Service could also provide simple ways for underserved consumers to “convert their cash to digital currency” or other electronic payment methods like prepaid cards, mobile payments and wire transfers.Two days after the paper came out, the IG held an invitation-only seminar in Virginia to discuss virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, as well as the potential benefits and disruptive effects they may have on traditional payment networks. But officials insisted to FoxNews.com that the Postal Service isn’t entering the world of virtual currency — or peer-to-peer payment systems not subject to regulation — just yet.“It is purely coincidental that the OIG hosted an invitation-only seminar to discuss virtual currencies into an electronic form of payment shortly after the white paper’s release,” according to clarification provided to FoxNews.com from the U.S. Postal Service Office of the Inspector General. “ … The USPS OIG did not present and does not have a position or recommendation on virtual currency.”- Bill Himpler, American Financial Services AssociationBanking industry officials told FoxNews.com that the agency that suffered a net loss of $5 billion in fiscal year 2013 — the 7th consecutive year in the red — should instead stick to delivering envelopes and parcels and stay out of financial services.“There’s an old phrase: Do few things and do them well,” said Bill Himpler, executive vice president of the American Financial Services Association. “The Postal Service has its hands full trying to stay above water in trying to accomplish its current mission. I would hate to see taxpayers on the hook for a half-baked venture like this.”Richard Hunt, president/CEO of the Consumers Bankers Association, characterized the white paper as the potential for “another radical government takeover” of an industry that the private sector is better suited to serve. He also questioned whether entering into those new ventures would necessitate a costly hiring surge.“You’d have to hire people who are knowledgeable about financial products,” Hunt told FoxNews.com. “So there’s tremendous start-up costs involved.”Rick Geddes, an associate professor at Cornell University and the director of its program on infrastructure policy, questioned whether there’s actually much to gain for the Postal Service in areas typically served by banks and other financial institutions.“To me, that seems like a substantial departure from what they’re doing now and I’m not sure I see where the core expertise is in the Postal Service to provide these types of financial services,” Geddes told FoxNews.com. “You’re talking about an entity that’s losing money hand over fist. If these services are so profitable, why haven’t other financial institutions companies got into this business?”Geddes continued: “Put yourself in the shoes of a small regional bank and you’ve got the Postal Service coming in … That’s a serious problem.”	2014-02-06

The auto industry is expected to post its best April sales totals since 2007 when major automakers report monthly tallies Wednesday, May 1, 2013. (AP Photo/Toby Talbot)The Associated PressDETROIT –  Ford, GM, Chrysler and Nissan all reported double-digit U.S. sales increases last month, signaling the best April for car and truck sales in six years.A rebound in pickup truck sales led the way, especially for the Detroit automakers. Small businesses are replacing aging trucks that theyve kept since the Great Recession.ADVERTISEMENTFords sales increased 18 percent, with the F-Series pickup gaining 24 percent. At Chrysler, sales rose 11 percent, led by the Ram pickup, with a 49 percent sales increase. GM also saw an 11 percent sales jump, with Chevrolet Silverado pickup sales rising 28 percent for the month.Nissan reported a 23 percent sales gain over April of 2012. The only laggard was Volkswagen, with a sales decline of 10 percent.The gains are another sign that Americans continue to buy cars and trucks despite high unemployment and mixed economic signals. All automakers report monthly sales Wednesday, and industry analysts expect an overall increase of around 10 percent over April of last year. That would make it the best April since 2007.Chrysler Group LLC said it sold 156,698 cars and trucks last month. Sales of the Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV increased 27 percent. Dodge brand sales rose 18 percent, with the Dart compact car posting its best month ever with sales of nearly 8,100. But the Chrysler brand struggled, with sales falling 13 percent.Ford Motor Co. sold 212,584 cars and trucks. The F-series pickup remains the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. Sales totaled 59,000 in April. And sales of the redesigned Escape SUV rose 52 percent.General Motors Co. reported sales of 237,646 cars and trucks. Even with gas prices on the decline, compact cars remain popular. Sales of the Chevy Cruze rose 21 percent.Nissan sales were boosted by demand for the recently redesigned Altima midsize car and Sentra compact. The company also took a step toward boosting future numbers. It announced price cuts on seven models that make up 65 percent of its U.S. sales. The cuts, effective on Friday, run from $580 on the top-selling Altima to $4,400, on the Armada big SUV.VWs sales drop was led by its top-seller, the Passat midsize car, which fell 10 percent.Chrysler predicted that total U.S. sales will hit an annual rate of 15.4 million in April. Thats a little higher than most analysts predictions. April is likely to be the sixth straight month of sales above a 15 million yearly pace.Barring an unexpected event that causes a real estate price collapse or rapidly rising job losses, theres little to stop sales from growing further in the next few years, industry analysts say."I dont see any significant hurdles on the horizon," said Alec Gutierrez, a senior market analyst at Kelley Blue Book. "I dont see us taking a step back, provided the unemployment rate at least holds steady."He expects U.S. auto sales to end the year around 15.3 million cars and trucks, up 5.5 percent from last years 14.5 million.U.S. unemployment stands at a stubbornly high 7.6 percent, but that hasnt slowed auto sales much.Aside from unemployment, almost every factor that affects car and truck sales is positive. Interest rates are low — the average four-year loan on a new car is 2.4 percent, according to Bankrate.com. Also, credit is widely available, even to those with low scores. Used-car values are high, so car buyers can get good trade-in value for their old cars. Lease deals are good. Gas prices have fallen since February.In addition, home-building is on the rise, up 7 percent from February to March. That means better sales of big pickup trucks as companies and laborers return to the market. Kelley Blue Book expects big pickup sales to rise more than 26 percent in April over a year ago.Many businesses and consumers need to replace older trucks and cars. The average age of a U.S. vehicle is 11.2 years. Plus, automakers have rolled out dozens of exciting new models in the past year, drawing buyers into showrooms."Relatively lower gas prices coupled with small business demand improving for trucks resulted in a strong showing for small and large pickups in April," said Jesse Toprak, senior analyst for the TrueCar.com auto pricing site.One category thats soaring is small crossover SUVs. Sales rose an estimated 22.5 percent in April, according to Kelley Blue Book. Fuel-efficient models such as the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Mazda CX-5 are driving sales, Gutierrez said.Kelley Blue Book estimates that auto prices fell slightly in April compared with a year ago, to an average of $31,326.	2013-05-01

CHICAGO –  Drew Miller clearly remembers the day his father was laid off.Miller, now 25, was a freshman at an Ohio college, full of hope and ready to take on the world. But here was this "red flag ... a big wake-up call," he says. The prosperous years of childhood were over, and his future was likely to be bumpier than hed expected.ADVERTISEMENTAcross the country, others of Millers generation heard that same wake-up call as the Great Recession set in. But would it change them? And would the impact last?The full effect wont be known for a while, of course. But a new analysis of a long-term survey of high school students provides an early glimpse at ways their attitudes shifted in the first years of this most recent economic downturn.Among the findings: Young people showed signs of being more interested in conserving resources and a bit more concerned about their fellow human beings.Compared with youths who were surveyed a few years before the recession hit, more of the Great Recession group also was less interested in big-ticket items such as vacation homes and new cars — though they still placed more importance on them than young people who were surveyed in the latter half of the 1970s, an era with its own economic challenges.Either way, it appears this latest recession "has caused a lot of young people to stop in their tracks and think about whats important in life," says Jean Twenge, a psychology professor at San Diego State University who co-authored the study with researchers from UCLA.The analysis, released Thursday, is published in the online edition of the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science.Its data comes from "Monitoring the Future," an annual survey of young people that began in the mid-1970s. The authors of the study compared responses of high school seniors from three time periods — 1976-1978 and 2004-2006, as well as 2008-2010, the first years of the Great Recession.They found that at the beginning of this latest recession, more of the 12th-graders were willing to use a bicycle or mass transit instead of driving — 36 percent in 2008-2010, compared with 28 percent in the mid-2000s. However, that was still markedly lower than the 49 percent of respondents in the 1970s group who said the same.There were similar patterns for other responses, such as those who said they:— Make an effort to turn heat down to save energy: 78 percent (1976-1978); 55 percent (2004-2006); and 63 percent (2008-2010).— Want a job directly helpful to others: 50 percent (1976-1978); 44 percent (2004-2006); and 47 percent (2008-2010).— Would eat differently to help the starving: 70 percent (1976-1978); 58 percent (2004-2006); and 61 percent (2008-2010).Psychologist Patricia Greenfield said the findings fit with other research shes done that shows that people become more community-minded, and less materialistic, when faced with economic hardship."To me, its a silver lining," says Greenfield, another of the studys contributors, along with lead author Heejung Park, an advanced doctoral student in psychology at UCLA.Their analysis found that, of the three groups, the Great Recession group was still most likely to want jobs where they could make a "significant" amount of money. But the authors say that may simply be attributable to the ever-rising cost of day-to-day expenses, from groceries to electric and gas bills.In comparison, they note that the Great Recession group also showed a bit less interest in luxury items than the students who were surveyed in the mid-2000s.For instance, 41 percent of high school seniors questioned 2008-2010 said it was important to own a vacation home, compared with 46 percent in 2004-2006. Again, both percentages are higher than the 34 percent who said the same in 1976-1978.These findings have a margin of error of plus-or-minus 1 percentage point, or less.Tina Wells, CEO of Buzz Marketing Group, which tracks youth trends, says the analysis fits with what shes seen in her own work.Many young people, she says, are living in what she calls "millennial purgatory," unemployed or under-employed, working in jobs below their qualifications, and sometimes still living at home with their parents. During the Great Recession the unemployment rate for 15- to 24-year-olds has risen above 20 percent — more than double the overall rate."If youre 22 and trying to jump-start your life right now, its not so easy," Wells says.As a result, various 20-somethings have tempered their career expectations in different ways.Until the economy improves, "Ive been opting for security over the perfect job," says Calvin Wagner, a 24-year-old accountant in suburban Cincinnati. As he bides his time, working for a small company with little chance for advancement, hes studying for the exam to become a certified public accountant.Like many of the survey respondents, Ashley Rousseau, a 25-year-old in Miami, says shes now more focused on a job that helps her community in some way than in landing "a corner office.""The recession made it even more clear that Im not going to find job satisfaction from a high-paying career," says Rousseau, whos getting her MBA and works at the medical school at Florida International University, which she says "improves the medical care in the community.""Im proud to be part of that mission," she says.Miller, the 25-year-old whose dad was laid off, left Ohio when he couldnt find work there in his field, electrical engineering. He moved to Alexandria, Va., after finding a government contracting job. But he recently decided to take a chance on a new company thats using "smart technology" to help big corporations cut electrical usage for lighting their spaces.Though it meant taking a small pay cut, he says having a job that helps the environment was a "huge" motivator.It remains to be seen, however, how members of this generation will cope with this economic adversity.Brent Donnellan, an associate professor of psychology at Michigan State University, has found that how parents handle the stress of an economic situation affects a childs resilience. But so does the childs personality. Perhaps not surprisingly, Donnellan says, studies have found that young people who have more self-control and who do well in school tend to weather economic hardship better.Still others wonder if the shifts in attitudes noted in the study will last.Lane Kenworthy, whos looked at the impact of various recessions, isnt so sure."In almost every case, public opinion has roughly gone back right back to what it was before," says Kenworthy, a professor of sociology and political science at the University of Arizona, who co-wrote a chapter on this topic for a book titled "The Great Recession."The biggest exception, he says, is the Great Depression of the 1930s, when unemployment rose as high as 25 percent.That major economic downturn saw a big shift toward the Democratic party, he says, and an embracing of government programs such as Social Security.The downturn of the 1970s — which caused public opinion to sway Republican — was the only other noteworthy exception he found, he says.Kenworthy says this recession might impact young people more because they tend to be more impressionable than their elders. But he says a lot will hinge on how long the economic downturn lasts — and how deeply they feel the pain.Miller, in Virginia, says he still sees a lot of his peers living beyond their means and that worries him."I hope that mentality will change to say, Hey, we have to plan ahead because this could happen again," he says.But Monica Raofpur, a recent graduate of the University of Texas at Dallas, doubts the Great Recession will forever change her generation."People usually adapt to their surroundings and make decisions based on what is going on in the present, not in the past," says Raofpur, a sales consultant in the tech industry.The UCLA/San Diego State study was funded by the Russell Sage Foundation, which focuses social issues and has funded several projects related to the Great Recession.___On the Internet:Russell Sage Foundation: http://www.russellsage.org___Martha Irvine is an AP national writer.

Thats up from $75.4 million, or 47 cents per share, earned in its first quarter last year.ADVERTISEMENTGreen Mountain benefited from an extra week in the most recent quarter.The company earned 64 cents per share in the most recent quarter after adjusting for costs tied to a regulatory inquiry and other special items. That handily beat the 48 cents per share that analysts polled by FactSet had forecast.Green Mountains total revenue increased 33 percent to $946.7 million from $711.9 million on stronger sales and price increases for its single-serve coffee packs. Analysts were expecting revenue of $902.7 million.The company was the pioneer in single-serve coffee makers in the U.S. with its Keurig system. It grew quickly on the popularity of the product, but it began to struggle as competitors came out with their own versions and its key patents expired. It also has faced a multi-year U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into its accounting practicesHowever, Green Mountain has hired a new CEO, added new brewer models and extended the array of single-serve beverage packets that it sells.The company managed to improve its sales for the quarter, reporting that revenue from sales of its brewers and accessories increased 45 percent year-over-year and single-serve pack revenue increased 59 percent. Its royalty revenue fell for the quarter.President and CEO Lawrence Blanford said that the strong quarter speaks to the companys "continued strategic progress." He said the companys management team also believes it points to the significant opportunity still ahead for the company.Green Mountain said it expects to earn 62 to 67 cents per share for its first quarter on an adjusted basis. It said its sales would increase 14 to 18 percent over the same period in its prior fiscal year. That calculates to a revenue forecast of $1.32 billion to $1.37 billion.Analysts had forecast earnings of 57 cents per share on revenue of $1.28 billion.The company reiterated its full-year forecast of earning $2.64 to $2.74 per share on an adjusted basis with revenue gains of 15 to 20 percent. That calculates to a revenue forecast of roughly $4.44 billion to $4.63 billion.Analysts had forecast earnings of $2.49 per share for the year on revenue of $4.39 billion.Green Mountain earned $362.6 million, or $2.28 per share, for its full fiscal year. Thats up from $199.5 million, or $1.31 per share, in the prior year. It earned $2.40 per share versus $1.64 per share last year on an adjusted basis. Its annual revenue jumped to $3.86 billion from $2.65 billion.Shares soared $6.45 to $35.40 in after-hours trading on the news.

412	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/02/school-hard-knocks-small-business-owners-lose-companies-learn-lesson-from-great/	School of hard knocks: Small business owners lose companies, learn lesson from Great Recession	NEW YORK –  For some small business owners, the Great Recession turned out to be a lesson in how to run their companies better.Many owners whose businesses failed during the recession have taken the plunge again, restarting or opening new businesses. But theyre not repeating past mistakes. Their companies are leaner, smarter and less risky.ADVERTISEMENTThere are no definitive numbers on how many small businesses failed during the recession. But there were 337,303 fewer companies with under 499 employees in 2011 than there were before the recession began, according to the Census Bureau. The government hasnt released more recent statistics, so its not known how many new companies there are, or how many owners went on to start new businesses.Heres how some of the companies are making sure they are more recession-resistant:INTERNET, NOT INVENTORYLet someone else take the risk. Thats the lesson Frank Muscarello learned from the recession, and the strategy hes used in building MarkITx, an online marketplace where companies from Fortune 500 corporations to the smallest businesses can buy and sell refurbished computers, servers and other high-tech equipment.Muscarello started Chicago-based MarkITx in December 2009, right after he lost his previous business, Vision Point of Sale, in a bankruptcy auction. That company failed after its bank suddenly demanded collateral on a $3.5 million loan during the credit crisis in 2008. While Muscarello had cash registers worth millions of dollars, the bank considered them almost worthless because they couldnt all be sold within 90 days. Without collateral, the bank called the loan, and because Muscarello couldnt quickly sell his cash registers, he didnt have the money to repay it."I never wanted to be in the inventory game again," Muscarello says.MarkITx doesnt hold any inventory. Its website lists equipment for sale, and helps sellers set a price. The company takes payment from buyers and holds it in escrow until the machines are delivered. It also arranges for equipment to be shipped to a separate company that inspects it and refurbishes it. The website, which began operating in April 2011, has more than 2,300 users.MarkITx is less vulnerable to economic downturns, Muscarello says."I need an inventory-less business model to really grow," he says.SCALING BACK AND RESTARTINGMark Viggiano has improved his restaurants chances of success this time around by scaling back. Hes serving only dinner, not lunch, at Viggianos BYOB, and is closed Mondays, typically a slow day at restaurants.The Italian restaurant reopened in the Philadelphia suburb of Conshohocken a year ago after failing in 2009. By cutting its hours and opening only at its busiest time, Viggiano has lowered overhead costs. He employs a smaller staff. Since most customers make their reservations online, he no longer needs a hostess starting early to take phone calls. Hes working in the kitchen, what he loves to do. The changes allow him to have a staff of 14, down from 55.He has time to do his own food shopping instead of having it delivered, saving more money.Viggiano also renegotiated his lease and got his rent lowered.These steps have boosted Viggianos cash flow, which was hurt when customers dined out less during the recession. High rent and a heavy debt load also hobbled the restaurant. So did big sporting events that lured customers away to sports bars on weekends, his most lucrative nights.Slow nights dont worry him now."I used to say, Im going to jump off the bridge tonight. Now I can take a hit like that," he says.LIVING WITH SLOWER GROWTHTotal Home Supplys revenue isnt exploding like co-owner Mike Luongos previous company, AM Royal. Hes not complaining.AM Royal, which sold major appliances like washers and dryers, thrived with the housing market boom. Sales surged from $2 million in 2004, its first year, to almost $10 million four years later, and the Fairfield N.J.-based company expanded to rent a second warehouse. But it went bankrupt after housings plunge caused revenue to drop by more than 50 percent, to $5 million in 2009.Luongo and two business partners have a more cautious approach with Total Home Supply, which focuses on selling cooling and heating equipment, including air conditioners.By limiting major appliances and furniture to 25 percent of the business, theyre not dependent on the housing market. This company is also leaner. The partners have negotiated better deals with manufacturers, so their expenses are lower and their profit margins bigger.Revenue at Total Home Supply was $2.5 million last year, up from $1 million in its first year, 2010. Luongo says it might reach $4 million this year."I feel very comfortable about the direction were in," Luongo says._____Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg	2014-07-02

Its a sign that the sluggish half-decade recovery from the Great Recession is finally building momentum.Monthly job gains so far this year have averaged 230,833, up from 194,250 in 2013.The unemployment rate dipped last month to its lowest level since September 2008.	2014-07-03

The four-week average, a less volatile measure, declined to 311,750.ADVERTISEMENTThere are 2.56 million people receiving benefits. Thats the lowest total since October 2007, about two months before the recession began.Applications are a proxy for layoffs, so the relatively low number of people seeking benefits shows that employers are letting go of fewer workers. When businesses are confident enough to keep staff, they may also hire more workers. Job gains should feed stronger economic growth.Last week the Labor Department said employers added a solid 217,000 jobs in May.	2014-06-19

But the pace of buying this year remains slower than in 2013, in part because of sluggish sales during winter.The National Association of Realtors said Monday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index rose 6.1 percent to 103.9 last month. It was the sharpest month-over-month gain since April 2010. The index remains 5.2 percent below its level a year ago.ADVERTISEMENTPending sales are a barometer of future purchases. A one- to two-month lag usually exists between a contract and a completed sale.Lower mortgage rates and increased supplies of homes on the market drove much of last months gains. Signed contracts rose in all four U.S. regions: the Northeast, Midwest, South and West.The housing market is finally showing signs of momentum, though overall buying remains slower than last year."The sector continues to put the horrid (winter) weather behind it and is moving on," said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. "It certainly helps that confidence is higher, borrowing costs are slipped from the start of the year and it is reportedly becoming less strenuous to obtain a mortgage."In a separate report last week, the Realtors said completed sales of existing homes rose 4.9 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million homes. Still, sales are down 5 percent year-over-year.The Realtors forecast that sales of existing homes will decline 2.8 percent this year to 4.95 million, compared with 5.1 million in 2013.Sales of new homes jumped 18.6 percent last month to an annual rate of 504,000, the highest level since May 2008, the government said last week.Two sources of friction in the housing market have recently eased: Mortgage rates and supplies of homes for sale.Sales began to slow in the second half of last year as mortgage rates crept up from historic lows and prices rose further, making it less affordable for many Americans to buy. There were also too few homes for sale, which meant that would-be buyers had to delay their purchases until they had more options from which to choose.Average rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages declined to 4.17 percent last week, down from 4.20 percent the previous week. Mortgage rates are about a quarter of a percentage point higher than at the same time last year.The supply of homes for sale has also risen. The number rose 2.2 percent in May to 2.28 million. The supply is 6 percent higher than a year ago, which analysts say should help slow price growth and boost sales.	2014-06-30

Many economists say 2014 will be the year the economic recovery from the Great Recession finally achieves the robust growth that’s needed to accelerate hiring and reduce still-high unemployment. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  The economy likely stumbled at the start of this year, but theres probably little reason to worry: Economists foresee a solid rebound with the end of a harsh winter.The Commerce Department on Wednesday will issue the first of three estimates of how fast the economy grew in the January-March quarter. The expectation is that growth slowed to an annual rate of around 1.1 percent, a lackluster pace that would be sharply down from a 2.6 percent annual growth rate in the previous quarter.ADVERTISEMENTEconomists think the first-quarter slump, caused in large part by the severe winter, will give way to stronger growth that should endure through the rest of the year.Most analysts say a bounce-back in consumer spending, business investment and job growth will lift growth in the second quarter.In fact, many say 2014 will be the year the recovery from the Great Recession finally achieves the robust growth thats needed to accelerate hiring and reduce still-high unemployment.Analysts think annual economic growth has rebounded to around 3 percent in the current April-June quarter and will remain roughly that strong through the second half of the year.If that proves accurate, the economy will have produced the fastest annual expansion in the gross domestic product, the broadest gauge of the economys health, in nine years. The last time growth was so strong was in 2005, when GDP grew 3.4 percent, two years before the nation fell into the worst recession since the 1930s.A group of economists surveyed this month by The Associated Press said they expected unemployment to fall to 6.2 percent by the end of this year from 6.7 percent in March.One reason for the optimism is that a drag on growth last year from higher taxes and deep federal spending cuts has been diminishing. A congressional budget truce has also lifted any imminent threat of another government shutdown. As a result, businesses may find it easier to commit to investments to modernize and expand production facilities and boost hiring.State and local governments, which have benefited from a rebound in tax revenue, are hiring again as well.A survey by the private Conference Board released Tuesday found that while U.S. consumer confidence dipped this month, many people foresee a strengthening economy in the months ahead.Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, said he expects job growth to average above 200,000 a month for the rest of the year — starting with the April jobs report, which will be released Friday."Those are the types of job gains which will generate incomes and consumer confidence going forward," Naroff said.Naroff said solid job growth should lead consumers, who drive about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, to boost spending. He expects pent-up demand from purchases that were put off during the harsh winter to power a burst of growth in the April-June quarter. He thinks annual growth for the quarter will reach a vigorous 4.3 percent.	2014-04-30

She said Bernanke showed such courage in responding to the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession.ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking at a ceremony at New Yorks Yankee Stadium, Yellen said Bernanke faced "relentless criticism, personal threats and the certainty that history would judge him harshly if he was wrong.""You, too, will face moments in life when standing up for what you believe can make all the difference," Yellen said."There is an unfortunate myth," she told the graduates, "that success is mainly determined by something called ability."In fact, she said, research shows that measures of ability are unreliable predictors of performance in academics or employment. Instead, she said whats more important is a quality that psychologist Angela Lee Duckworth calls grit — "an abiding commitment to work hard toward long-range goals and to persevere through the setbacks that come along the way."When the financial crisis erupted, Yellen was president of the Feds San Francisco regional bank. She was tapped to become the Feds vice chair, the No. 2 position, in 2010.Yellen said she and her Fed colleagues had struggled during the crisis to produce the right mix of programs to deal with the economic threats."We brainstormed and designed a host of program to unclog the plumbing of the financial system and to keep credit flowing," she told the graduates. "Not everything worked, but we kept at it and we remained focused on the task at hand."Yellen, the first woman to lead the Fed in its 100-year history, was awarded an honorary doctorate at the ceremony.Honorary doctorates were also given to former Yankees pitching great Mariano Rivera, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan and singer Aretha Franklin.___Associated Press writer Karen Matthews contributed to this report from New York.	2014-05-21
529	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/06/09/business-economists-foresee-healthy-pickup-in-economy-after-weather-beaten-1st/	Business economists foresee healthy pickup in economy after weather-beaten 1st quarter	WASHINGTON –  U.S. economic growth should accelerate in the second quarter and remain healthy for the rest of this year, according to a forecast by a group of U.S. business economists. Still, growth for the full year will likely come in lower than they previously estimated.Job growth should remain steady and consumer spending will also likely pick up, a survey by the National Association of Business Economists said Monday. The survey of 47 economists from companies, trade associations and academia was conducted from May 8 to May 21.ADVERTISEMENTThe survey also found that economists increasingly agree that the Federal Reserve will end its bond purchase program by the end of this year.Thats partly because economists are optimistic about growth for the rest of this year: They expect it will jump to 3.5 percent in the second quarter and remain above 3 percent for the rest of the year.But the pickup comes after harsh winter weather caused the nations gross domestic product to contract 1 percent in the first three months of the year, much worse than analysts had expected. GDP is the broadest measure of an economys output.That weak first quarter reading has caused many economists to lower their expectations for 2014 as a whole. The NABE survey found that economists now project growth will be just 2.5 percent this year, down from a forecast of 2.8 percent in March.The new forecast is still slightly above the annual average growth rate of about 2.2 percent since the recession ended in June 2009 and up from 1.9 percent in 2013. But stronger growth is needed to accelerate hiring and boost wage growth, which has been weak by historical standards.The NABEs survey is slightly more pessimistic than the Federal Reserves most recent projections, released in March. The Fed expects growth will be between 2.8 percent and 3 percent this year. The Fed may lower its growth outlook for this year when it releases its next forecasts later this month because of the first quarters contraction.Economists are nearing a consensus about the timing of the Federal Reserves next moves. Nearly three-quarters expect the Fed will end its bond purchase program in the final three months of this year, the NABE survey found. Thats up from the 57 percent who said so three months ago.The Fed is purchasing Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds in an effort to lower long-term interest rates to encourage more borrowing and spending. It has been steadily paring back the program, from $85 billion a month last year to $45 billion in May.In addition, 86 percent of economists forecast that the Fed will raise the benchmark short-term interest rate it controls for the first time in 2015. In March, just 53 percent said 2015, while one-third said this year and 15 percent said a rate hike wouldnt occur until 2016.The NABE survey found that the economists are more optimistic about hiring. They project that employers will add 209,000 jobs a month this year. Thats up from their March forecast of 188,000.So far this year, hiring has been a little bit better: it has averaged 214,000 a month from January through May.More jobs means more people earning paychecks, and that can boost spending. Economists are more optimistic about consumer spending this year, which they estimate will grow at a 2.9 percent pace. That would be the highest level since 2006.___Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber	2014-06-09
574	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/11/25/cyber-monday-likely-to-be-busiest-online-shopping-day/	Cyber Monday likely to be busiest online shopping day	Black Friday is a distant memory. Small Business Saturday is long gone. Now, its Cyber Mondays turn.Cyber Monday, coined in 2005 by a shopping trade group that noticed a spike in online sales on the Monday after Thanksgiving when people returned to their work computers, is the next in a line of days that stores are counting on to jumpstart the holiday shopping season.ADVERTISEMENTThis years Cyber Monday is expected to be the biggest online shopping day of the year for the third year in a row: According to research firm comScore, Americans are expected to spend $1.5 billion, up from $1.25 billion last year on Cyber Monday, as retailers ramp up deals to get shoppers to click on their websites.Amazon.com, which is starting its Cyber Monday deals at midnight on Monday, is offering as much as 60 percent off a Panasonic VIERA 55-inch TV thats usually priced higher than $1,000. Sears is offering $430 off a Maytag washer and dryer, each on sale for $399. And Kmart is offering 75 percent off diamond earrings and $60 off a 12-in-1 multigame table on sale for $89.99.Retailers are hoping the deals will appeal to shoppers like Matt Sexton, 39, who for the first time plans to complete all his holiday shopping online this year on his iPad tablet computer. Sexton, who plans to spend up to $4,000 this season, already shopped online on the day after Thanksgiving known as Black Friday and found a laptop from Best Buy for $399, a $200 savings, among other deals."The descriptions and reviews are so much better online so you can compare and price shop and for the most part get free shipping," said Sexton, who lives in Queens, N.Y., and is a manager at a utility company.Sexton also said its easy to return an online purchase to a physical store than it had been in previous years. "That helps with gifts," he said.How well retailers do on Cyber Monday will offer insight into Americans evolving shopping habits. With the growth in high speed Internet access and the wide and increasing use of smartphones and tablet computers, people are relying less on their work computers to shop than they did when Shop.org, the digital division of trade group The National Retail Federation, coined the term "Cyber Monday."As a result, the period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday has have become busy for online shopping as well. Indeed, IBM Benchmark, which tracks online sales, said on Thanksgiving, a day that historically had not been big for online shopping, online sales this year rose 17.4 percent over 2011. Of that, mobile shopping, or shopping on smartphones and tablets, rose 18.3 percent. Meanwhile, online sales on Black Friday were up 20.7 percent.For the overall holiday season, comScore predicts online sales will be up 17 percent to $43.4 billion. And the research firm expects online sales to surpass 10 percent of total retail spending this holiday season. The National Retail Federation estimates that overall retail sales in November and December will be up 4.1 percent this year to $586.1 billion."People years ago didnt have the kind of connectivity to shop online at their homes. So when they went back to work after Thanksgiving theyd shop on the Monday after," said Vicki Cantrell, executive director of Shop.org. "Now they dont need the work computer to be able to do that."But as other days become popular for online shopping, Cyber Monday may lose some of its cache. To be sure, Cyber Monday hasnt always been the biggest online shopping day. In fact, up until three years ago, that title was historically held on the last day shoppers can order items with standard shipping rates and get them delivered before Christmas. That day usually falls in late December.Even though Cyber Monday is expected to be the biggest shopping day this year, industry watchers say it could just be a matter of time before other days take that ranking."Of all the benchmark spending days, Thanksgiving is growing at the fastest rate, up 128 percent over the last five years," said Andrew Lipsman, a spokesman with comScore.	2012-11-25

A strong market for used cars also has played a role in lowering auto-loan delinquency rates because it has given borrowers an incentive to avoid falling behind on payments.As a result, auto-loan delinquencies have fallen 56 percent since the recession high of 0.86 percent set in the fourth quarter of 2008, TransUnion said.The trend has held up even as drivers have been taking on higher levels of auto-loan debt.In the third quarter, bank auto debt per borrower grew 5 percent to $13,571, up from $12,902 a year earlier, TransUnion said.One reason for that is that banks are making more auto loans, which tend to have higher balances early on, as it typically takes several years for borrowers to pay them down.The rise in auto sales also has spurred banks to step up lending even to borrowers with less-than-stellar credit.TransUnions analysis of data on new auto loans lags by a quarter, so the most recent figures are for the second quarter.Nearly 33 percent of new auto loans issued in the April-to-June period were made to nonprime borrowers, up from 30.2 percent a year earlier. Non-prime borrowers are defined as those with a score between 501 and 700 on the VantageScore credit scale, which runs between 501 and 990, with borrowers scoring at 900 or above being considered prime borrowers, or the safest credit bet.The portion of all auto loans that went to nonprime borrowers in the second quarter was up 27.5 percent from the same period two years earlier.In all, new auto loans and leases grew by 16 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, TransUnion said.The average balance of new auto loans also increased on an annual basis in the second quarter, rising 2.4 percent to $17,829.Given the rise in auto loans going to higher-risk borrowers and the uptick in average balances, its plausible that the auto-loan delinquency rate could inch up in the fourth quarter, Turek noted."However, as the economy continues to improve and new and used auto demand maintains its current pace, we believe that the auto-loan delinquency rate will either remain the same or even drop a few basis points by the end of the year," he said.	2012-11-26

At this years North American International Auto Show in Detroit, which opens to the public Jan. 19, visitors can see 500 cars and trucks spread over 18 carpeted acres. At least 800,000 people are expected to take in all the shiny models, amid the bright lights and thumping mood music.The biggest draw will be the first new Corvette in nine years. Technology lovers can see an experimental concept from electric carmaker Tesla and a diesel version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Young buyers can check out a small SUV concept from Honda. Big spenders — and big dreamers — can take a gander at the new Bentley convertible.But for all the gleaming metal, most models wont be new to fans. Corvette lovers have been salivating over drawings posted on the Web. Spy cameras snapped an Acura MDX last fall, months before its official debut in Detroit. Mercedes has already released photos of its E-Class coupe and convertible.But even with all those spoilers, visitors keep flocking to Detroit and other auto shows. They want to touch the cars, check out the trunk space or just hop in."You cant do enough on a screen. You cant crawl inside and get a feel for it," says Rod Alberts, a 23-year veteran of the Detroit show who is now its executive director.Detroit is one of 65 shows that will be held in the U.S. this year, from a tiny one in Toledo to New York and Chicago gatherings that attract more than 1 million visitors each year. Detroit has been holding an auto show almost continuously since the early 1900s, when local dealers lined up a handful of cars alongside fishing and hunting gear.More than half of visitors at the Detroit show are shopping for a new car, according to informal polls. And with car sales stronger than theyve been in five years, attendance at NAIAS and other shows could be higher in 2013, after slipping during the recession. Car sales rose 13 percent to 14.5 million last year and could reach 15 million in 2013.The auto show is the ideal venue for shoppers because they can browse without being pestered by salespeople, says Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst with car buying site Edmunds.com."Its like the circus. Its the only place you can see it under one roof," she says.Its also a circus for car companies. Literally. Infiniti will use performers from Cirque du Soleil to introduce its new small car in Detroit."Auto shows are one of the rare moments that the brand can meet the customer, shake their hand, look them in the eye and say, This is who we are," says Jim Farley, Fords global marketing director.Car companies had to cut back on their displays during the downturn. Most are no longer doing the kinds of expensive stunts they did at the Detroit show before the sobering recession, which forced them to close plants and lay off thousands of workers. In 1992, then-Chrysler chief Bob Lutz drove the new Jeep Grand Cherokee through a plate glass window. This year, Lutz will be talking to a holographic image of Thomas Edison at the display of electric-truck maker Via Motors.And the element of surprise is gone. Icons like the Ford Mustang and Dodge Viper were seen for the first time when sheets were pulled off of them in Detroit. As recently as 2000, there were audible gasps when General Motors revealed the ungainly Pontiac Aztek."There isnt going to be that sort of shock and awe that you had at earlier shows," says Justin Hyde, senior editor of the Yahoo Autos Motoramic blog.Bloggers are already abuzz about whether a new Ferrari supercar will appear next year in Detroit.Still, Hyde says, the show is the best place to get a lot of information about cars in a global market thats become huge and fractured. More than 6,000 journalists from 70 countries will attend two days of media previews starting on Monday, giving the show a reach far beyond Detroit. Thats up from just 850 journalists 25 years ago.Nissan is one of several brands that pulled out of the Detroit show in recent years, only to return when they realized its impact. This year, Nissan is going all out, even appealing to the sense of smell in its display. It plans to pump a green tea-like fragrance into its Detroit exhibit.The idea? To put visitors at ease. And maybe get them to part with a little green of their own.	2013-01-12

There were trucks going by, she says. All she wanted was for the rig to go away.Across the U.S., new oil and gas wells have turned millions of people into the petroleum industrys neighbors. For many, the oil and gas companies are welcome newcomers bearing checks. Others consider the new arrivals loud, smelly and disruptive. The drilling boom is firing up resentment in some communities when one persons financial windfall means their neighbors abut a working well.The Wall Street Journal analyzed well location and census data for more than 700 counties in 11 major energy-producing states. At least 15.3 million Americans lived within a mile of a well that has been drilled since 2000. That is more people than live in Michigan or New York City.The arrival of the Oil Patch in the nations backyards is a result of an extraordinary U.S. energy boom driven largely by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a practice that makes it possible to tap into dense, previously impenetrable shale formations to extract fossil fuels. Fracking enabled the drilling of the Niobrara Shale in Colorado, as well as the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, the Barnett Shale in Texas and others.The change can be dramatic. In Johnson County, Texas, in 2000, there were fewer than 20 oil and gas wells. Only a fraction of the residents of this mostly suburban county, south of Fort Worth, lived anywhere near a well or could tell you where to find one.Today, more than 3,900 wells dot the county and some 99.5% of its 150,000 residents live within a mile of a well. Similar transformations took place in parts of Pennsylvania, Colorado and Wyoming, according to Journal data.Click for more from The Wall Street Journal.	2013-10-26
996	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/06/05/watchdog-students-engaged-in-loan-fraud-increased-82-percent-since-200/	Watchdog: Students engaged in loan fraud increased 82 percent since 2009	WASHINGTON –  The number of college students who are suspected of engaging in loan fraud has increased 82 percent since 2009, the Education Departments watchdog reported Wednesday on the eve of congressional action to keep rates on those loans low.Suspected fraudulent awards increased from 18,719 students to 34,007 since 2009, according to the inspector generals report. That amounts to $874 million in potentially fraudulent student aid and, of that, auditors were confident the government lost $187 million.ADVERTISEMENTThat number is a very small slice of the more than almost 54 million students who borrowed for their education through federal programs during that time but is likely to complicate the future for a program that is up for congressional review."These programs are inherently risky because of their complexity, the amount of funds involved, the number of program participants and the characteristics of student populations," the reports authors wrote in their biannual report to Congress. "Our efforts in this area seek not only to protect federal student aid funds from waste, fraud and abuse, but also to protect the interests of the next generation of our nations leaders -- Americas students."Lawmakers in the Democratic-led Senate on Thursday were set to consider legislation to prevent interest rates on subsidized Stafford student loans doubling from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1.The Republican-led House already has passed its own version of student loan legislation that would provide relief for some students in the short term, but would mean potentially higher rates in future years if commercially available interest rates increase.President Barack Obama has threatened to veto the House version, which ties student loan interest rates to 10-year Treasury notes, with the loans interest rates resetting every year.The inspector generals report detailing fraud was unlikely to encourage undecided lawmakers. Critics of the student loan programs routinely cite fraud and abuse as reasons to oppose it, even though the program generates substantial revenues for the government.The Education Department previously wrote that more than 53.8 million recipients received almost than $510 billion in federal student financial aid during the 2009-2012 window.The Congressional Budget Office estimates federal loans issued this year will generate a net gain of almost $51 billion. Over the last five years, that sum is almost $120 billion.The head of the Education Departments watchdog arm has blamed fraud rings that target online and long-distance programs."Large, loosely affiliated groups of criminals who seek to exploit distance education programs in order to fraudulently obtain federal student aid because all aspects of distance education take place through the Internet -- admission, student aid, course instruction -- students are not required to present themselves in person at any point and institutions are not required to verify prospective and enrolled students identities," Education Inspector General Kathleen Tighe told members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in March."Fraud rings mainly target lower cost institutions, because the federal student aid awards are sufficient to pay institutional charges such as tuition, and the student receives the award balance to use for other educational expenses, such as books, room and board and commuting," she added.	2013-06-05

It was the latest in a growing list of snafus to hit financial markets, though hardly as stunning as the "flash crash" that set off a sudden stock-market plunge in May 2010.ADVERTISEMENT"The market has gotten quite complex and needlessly so," said Sal Arnuk, co-founder of the brokerage Themis Trading.The Nasdaq, a stock exchange dominated by the biggest names in technology, sent out an alert shortly after 12 p.m. EDT, saying it was stopping trading because of problems with its system for disseminating prices. The Nasdaq composite index spent much of the afternoon stuck at 3,631.17.Trading resumed at 3:25 p.m. EDT. Thirty-five minutes later, trading ended for the day with the index up 38 points, or 1 percent, at 3,638.71.Nasdaq said it wouldnt be canceling any open orders, but that customers could cancel orders if they wanted to.The Nasdaq shutdown appeared to occur in an orderly fashion and didnt upset other parts of the stock market.One stock that did take a hit was the parent company of the exchange, Nasdaq OMX. That stock fell $1.08, or 3.4 percent, to close at $30.46 in heavy trading.Government agencies, the Treasury Department and the White House released statements saying they were following the disruption."We are monitoring the situation and are in close contact with the exchanges," said John Nester, a spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission."This afternoon, the President was briefed by the White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough on this afternoons disruption of the Nasdaq," said Josh Earnest, the White Houses principal deputy press secretary.It was another sign that the days of stock brokers in colorful jackets, roaming the floor of the stock exchange, have faded away. Now, powerful computer programs dominate trading by sifting through reams of data and executing trades in fractions of a second. That makes trading faster and, arguably, more efficient. But it also introduces more possibilities for errors that can jolt the entire market.Last year, BATS Global Markets tried to go public on its own exchange but had to back out after a computer error sent the stock price plunging to just pennies. Facebooks public offering last spring was also error-riddled, as technical problems kept many investors from knowing if their trades had gone through and left some holding unwanted shares. And in April, the Chicago Board Options Exchange shut down for a morning because of a software problem.Then theres the 2010 "flash crash," where the Dow Jones industrial average fell hundreds of points in minutes before eventually closing 348 points lower. It was one of the first major blips that brought the potential dangers of computer-driven, high-frequency trading into the public sphere.One of the lessons from the flash crash is that its better to stop trading and re-open a market in a fair and orderly manner than to have messy trading, said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University who specializes in the structure and regulation of financial markets, said."I think people are so used to the fact that every once in a while the power goes out and a computer crashes," Angel said. "As long as the trading is fair and orderly I dont think thats going to deter people from investing."Trading glitches can also change fortunes. A technical bug spelled the end for Knight Capital as a stand-alone company, and marred its long-held reputation as a stellar risk manager, after it sent the stocks of dozens of companies swinging wildly on Aug. 1 last year.It also left Knight, which takes orders from big brokers like TD Ameritrade and E-Trade, on the hook for many of the stocks that its computers accidentally ordered. Knight teetered near bankruptcy and this summer was taken over by the high-speed trading firm Getco.___AP Business Writers Christina Rexrode, Steve Rothwell, Marcy Gordon and contributed.	2013-08-22

Nassau County and Elmont will realize much needed economic growth, and local residents will have a year-round premier destination they can call their own."In the 1970s, the Cosmos played in the North American Soccer League, and attracted worldwide attention by signing some of the greatest players of the day including the legendary Brazilian star Pele, Italys Georgio Chinaglia and West German star Franz Beckenbauer. The franchise folded in 1984 but announced last year that it would resume play in the NASL beginning in 2013; home games this season will be played at Hofstra Universitys former football stadium in Hempstead, N.Y.The NASL of today is a second-division, small-budget league with teams in Atlanta; Bayamon, Puerto Rico; Blaine, Minn.; Cary, N.C.; Edmonton, Alberta; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; St. Petersburg, Fla.; and San Antonio. The top American soccer league, Major League Soccer, has a New York franchise, the Red Bulls, playing in Harrison, N.J.The MLS last year proposed a stadium be built in neighboring Queens for an as-yet-unnamed soccer franchise to rival the Red Bulls. That team would play near Citi Field, the home of baseballs New York Mets.MLS spokesman Dan Courtemanche said in a statement Wednesday that the league is continuing to work with New York City and local officials on the Queens project. "We continue our discussions with a variety of potential ownership groups, all who are very interested in being involved with the division I soccer league in North America," he said. "MLS continues to support the development of the lower leagues."The Cosmos said in a statement that the team wasnt "in a position to comment about any other stadium proposals," but added that the franchise believes "in the strength of our proposal and the increasing interest in soccer both nationally and regionally."The Cosmos proposal, called Elmont Crossings, includes nine new restaurants, retail space, a 175-room hotel and a 4.3-acre public park. Team officials say it would create more than 500 construction jobs and over 3,000 full-time permanent jobs.If approved, the team expects to break ground in 2014. Retail sites would open in 2015 and the team could begin play in the spring of 2016.A spokeswoman for the Empire State Development Corp. said proposals for the property are currently being evaluated for feasibility, economic impact and experience of the project team.New York State Sen. Jack Martins, whose district includes Belmont Park, called the proposal "an exciting project - a real game-changer for the community, the county and the state. It will create thousands of short and long term jobs and economic opportunity where we need it most."Each June, the racetrack hosts the final leg of horse racings Triple Crown, the Belmont Stakes. Cosmos officials say they would not schedule events at the soccer stadium on dates that coincide with major races at Belmont.___AP sports writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report.	2013-01-16

The back-to-back gains followed a period of weakness in which spending fell in both January and February and was flat in March.ADVERTISEMENTThe construction industry has struggled with an unusually severe winter which curtailed building activity in many regions.Construction activity totaled $958.1 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in May, up 6.6 percent from a year ago.Economists are forecasting that housing and overall construction will regain momentum in coming months, helping to boost overall economic growth.	2014-07-01

Stock prices had plunged by nearly half in the recession. But theyve recovered all their losses and set new highs.

The West Coast ports that are Americas gateway for hundreds of billions of dollars of trade with Asia and beyond are no stranger to labor unrest and even violence. Now, the contract that covers nearly 20,000 dockworkers is set to expire, and businesses that trade in everything from apples to iPhones are worried about disruptions as the summer cargo crush begins.AP/FileLOS ANGELES –  The West Coast ports that are Americas gateway for hundreds of billions of dollars of trade with Asia and beyond are no stranger to labor unrest and even violence.Now, the contract that covers nearly 20,000 dockworkers is set to expire, and businesses that trade in everything from apples to iPhones are worried about disruptions just as the crush of cargo for the back-to-school and holiday seasons begins.ADVERTISEMENTWith contentious issues including benefits and job security on the table, smooth sailing is no guarantee.On one side is the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, with its tradition of fierce activism dating to the Great Depression, when two of its members were killed during a strike. On the other is the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents shipping lines and operators of terminals at 29 West Coast ports.Both acknowledge that they are unlikely to agree on a new contract before the current one expires June 30, but they plan to negotiate past that deadline. That would fit the pattern from contract talks in 2008 and 2002. In 2002, negotiators didnt reach an agreement until around Thanksgiving, following an impasse that led to a 10-day lockout and a big disruption in trade.The unions total control over the labor pool means huge bargaining leverage, which negotiators have parlayed into white-collar wages and perks for blue-collar work. A full-time longshoreman earns about $130,000 a year, while foremen earn about $210,000, according to employer data. Workers pay nearly nothing for health coverage that includes no premiums and $1 prescriptions.Neither side has publicly discussed progress on negotiations that began May 12 in San Francisco, which is headquarters to the union and the maritime association.Twelve years ago, the shutdown had a lasting impact on how products moved in and out of the United States. Hulking cranes idled. Ships anchored in San Francisco Bay and outside ports from Los Angeles to Seattle. Economists estimated the impact at $1 billion each day.Even after trade resumed, retailers — with their just-in-time supply chain — worried that West Coast ports risked becoming a bottleneck. Companies looked to Gulf Coast and East Coast ports, which courted them by upgrading facilities."They cant afford to have their goods hung up either out on the sea or on the docks," said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation.Between 2002 and last year, the portion of shipping containers that came into the U.S. through West Coast ports dropped from 50 percent to 44 percent, according to a study by Martin Associates, a firm that analyzes transportation systems. Imports to the Gulf of Mexico and the Northeast increased.Even so, West Coast ports handled cargo worth $892 billion in 2013 alone, according to trade data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau.Worries over the current negotiations have prompted some stores to route shipments away from the West Coast, Gold said. Other importers planning for fall and winter shopping have shipped early to beat the contracts expiration date.The maritime association warns that labor peace is essential to keeping West Coast ports competitive, especially with an expansion of the Panama Canal that will allow larger vessels to reach East Coast markets directly.The union is not persuaded, at least not publicly."The competitiveness argument is an old saw that gets trotted out every time theres a negotiation," said union spokesman Craig Merrilees. "The claim has generally been used in an effort to extract concessions from the union members."One area where the Pacific Maritime Association is looking for concessions is benefits. According to the PMA, the cost of benefits more than doubled over the past decade, reaching $93,200 per registered worker in fiscal year 2013.During these negotiations, a new incentive is in play: In 2018, a 40 percent tax on the value of "Cadillac" health plans above a certain threshold kicks in under the Affordable Care Act — and the unions coverage qualifies.Last July, workers and retirees picketed in Long Beach and in Tacoma, Washington, complaining that some families were shouldering tens of thousands of medical bills the health plan was not paying.Employers said legitimate claims were being paid, but they were scrutinizing tens of millions of dollars of treatments that were likely fraudulent, including phantom appointments and charges for cosmetic surgery.Other bargaining issues include what jobs will remain under union control, the introduction of technology that could make some jobs obsolete, and on-the-job safety measures.	2014-06-23

(AP Photo/Tony Dejak)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Optimism among chief executives of large U.S. companies has reached a two-year high, driven by a more positive outlook toward hiring and sales.The Business Roundtable said Tuesday that its CEO outlook index rose to 95.4 in the second quarter, up from 92.1 in the first quarter. That is the highest level since the second quarter of 2012.ADVERTISEMENTThe positive sentiment among CEOs of some of the largest U.S. companies could bode well for hiring and growth. The U.S. economy has been adding jobs at a steady pace this year and the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.3 percent, a five-year low.The proportion of CEOs expecting to hire in the next six months rose to 43 percent, up from just 37 percent in the first quarter.Still, the outlook was not all rosy: the percentage of CEOs planning to invest more in their businesses fell to 44 percent from 48 percent.Randall Stephenson, CEO of AT&T and chairman of the Roundtable, blamed the drop on the expiration of several investment tax breaks at the beginning of the year.The decline is "troubling because of the high correlation between business investment and economic and job growth," Stephenson said.The CEOs also forecast that the economy will grow at just a 2.3 percent pace in 2014. That would be better than last years 1.9 percent growth, but below many economists hopes at the beginning of this year that growth would reach 3 percent.Growth this year has been dragged down by harsh winter weather, which closed factories and kept consumers away from shopping malls and car dealers in the first quarter. Many analysts expect the economy contracted at a 2 percent annual rate from January through March.The International Monetary Fund, a global lending organization, lowered its forecast for U.S. growth this year to just 2 percent, from 2.7 percent, partly because of the weather impact.The Federal Reserve is also expected to downgrade its economic projections for this year after a two-day meeting ends Wednesday.The CEO survey was conducted between May 14 and June 4, and 131 of the Business Roundtables 200 member CEOs responded.	2014-06-17

Donnelly claimed the energy company offered him the job and then changed its decision upon hearing he did not have an official high school diploma, which the company requires. "Youve got a highly qualified young man who has years of relevant experience and was offered a job based on those qualifications," Donnelly said. "Because he has a home-schooled diploma, this company rescinded the offer.""The people at the lower level wanted him for the job. They then hired a background check company, which found it [the diploma] wasn’t a publicly recognized credential.""He was obviously qualified because they offered him the job," he said. "We’re not saying that they did anything illegal. They can do this. It’s just unethical and immoral. You’ve got this company excluding an entire class of people from employment. Its discrimination against home-schoolers."According to Ohios Department of Education website, "Home-schooled students do not receive an Ohio high school diploma recognized by the State Board of Education." "When pursuing employment or advanced education, home-schooled students may need to complete the GED to show equivalence to a state recognized high school diploma," the website reads.Donnelly explained that home-school diplomas are issued by parents, who often purchase them from organizations, such as his. He said his client did not opt to take the GED because "hes already completed his high school education" through home schooling."The GED is for people who havent finished high school," he said. Donnelly said he is working with state legislators to "recognize home-school diplomas as sufficient in demonstrating a child has completed a high school education." "We’ve tried to convince the company that there is no legal impediment" in hiring the man, whom Donnelly said had solid transcripts and grades that put him on the deans list at his community college. "We hope they will change their policy," he said. "Our country stands on the ideal that people are judged on their individual merit."NiSource said in a statement to Fox News that the company has hired qualified home-schooled candidates in the past and will continue to hire such candidates in the future."In fact, among our 8,000+ current employees, we are proud to have colleagues and coworkers who were home schooled or received other non-traditional educations. We value them as strong, skilled contributors to our organization," the statement read. 	2014-05-09

"I think its realistic, but it all depends on what nature brings."Hes already closing in on the mark, having collected more than 1,100 gallons this season.Its a big jump in production for the teenager who works to balance sports and school with his growing seasonal business."I guess what drives me is a love for it. I guess I have a passion for syrup," said Parker. "I got my inspiration from a local sugar house. I went on a visit a couple years ago and they showed me how to tap trees and they showed my how to hang the buckets and produce the syrup so from there I went home and borrowed 15 buckets and started tapping trees."From there Parkers passion grew."With the 15 buckets, I then went to 30 buckets and then, from the 30 buckets to 60 buckets. Then, finally, I did 100 buckets for a couple of seasons," said Parker. "Now I finally went to about 3,500 taps this season."Hes one of the youngest entrepreneurs in a growing agricultural field.Last year was a big one for the sticky stuff in the U.S. More than 3.2 million gallons were produced, up 70 percent over 2012 thanks to good weather and new technology. But experts say there is still much untapped potential in the industry."Production just about doubled in the last five to six years and were poised for future expansion. Were still tapping less than one percent of all the Maple trees here in the U.S.," said Michael Farrell, director of Cornell Universitys Sugar Maple Research & Extension Field Station in Lake Placid, N.Y."We have the trees. The resource is there," argues Farrell. He believes billions of trees could be tapped. "The market is there and so we just need to continue to focus our efforts on expanding both the production and consumption of pure maple."Back in 1860, U.S. sugar makers produced 6.6 million gallons of maple syrup, roughly double todays output. That was long before the modern development of corn-based and artificial sweeteners.Farrell believes pure maple can compete."One of the benefits of growing the maple syrup industry in the U.S. is the amount of jobs it creates in rural communities, especially in a time of the year where theres maybe not as many jobs in late winter, early spring," said Farrell, who added that the industry could bring in roughly half a billion dollars in profits each season.For now, Farrell said, pure maple makes up less than 10 percent of the total sales volume for pancake syrups. Most people across America are using an imitation syrup. He said the key to capturing more of the market is to convince people that pure maple is worth a little extra money."Its healthier and tastier and local- all the good things about pure maple that are not contained in the artificial competitors," said Farrell. "If youre going to have some sweet food pure maple is the best choice because it also contains a lot of minerals, in the syrup as well, theres antioxidants. Theres lots of good things in the syrup besides just sugar and it is all natural."He doesnt have to convince Parker."You cant beat pure maple syrup. Theres nothing like it in the world," said Parker.Molly Line joined Fox News Channel as a Boston-based correspondent in January 2006.	2014-04-26

It was the first negative quarter since 2011, and one more three-month stretch in the red would put the U.S. is back in recession. But nightly newscasts sought to present the data as a blip, blaming it on the weather — if they mentioned it at all.- Brent Baker, Media Research Center“All that snow and ice froze business, but most economists believe it sets the economy up for rebound this quarter and there are some encouraging signs in the numbers,” CBS News’ Anthony Mason reported. Neither ABC nor NBC reported the disappointing numbers at all. The preliminary quarterly estimate from the U.S. Department of Commerce had been that the economy grew at a modest 0.1 percent rate.Economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, generally agree that unusually brutal weather played a role in the economy contracting by a full percent for the first three months of the year. Some say President Obama’s economic policies didn’t help, either. But while that kind of analysis has a place in fair and balanced reporting, such rosy spin rarely found its way into headlines during the economic doldrums of the Bush administration."When the media arent ignoring bad economic news to protect Obama, theyre spinning it into good news,” Media Research Centers Brent Baker, who drew attention to the apparent double standard on the MRCs NewsBusters site, told FoxNews.com. “That sure wasnt a favor the press corps ever provided George W. Bush."The New York Times used the double entendre "Frigid First Quarter" to characterize both the lack of economic growth and the reason for it, while media outlets more versed in economics, such as Forbes, simply stated the facts up front and allowed informed sources to provide commentary below.Economist Kevin Hassett, a former advisor to Mitt Romney and now an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said the weather was indeed a major drag on the economy.“I think Obamas policies have absolutely put us on a lower growth trajectory, but I also think that the weather was 99 percent of the story in Q1,” said Hassett, who has written extensively about media bias. “Now, this is, in part, a testable thing.  If Q2 includes a major bounce back, of say, 4 percent instead of 2, then the weather story gets more credibility.”	2014-05-30

576	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/14/as-grim-fishing-year-approaches-industry-tries-to-deal-with-new-catch-limits/	As grim fishing year approaches, industry tries to deal with new catch limits	BOSTON –  Deep cuts in catch limits will hit New Englands fishing fleet in less than three weeks, and theres little hint any real relief is coming. But regulators and fishermen are still seeking ways to lessen a blow fishermen warn will finish them off.In recent months, federal regulators have pushed several measures that aim to give fishermen more fish to catch by the May 1 start of the 2013 fishing year. Meanwhile, fishing groups and lawmakers are lobbying for changes that would make year-to-year cuts in the crucial Gulf of Maine cod species less severe.ADVERTISEMENTAs time grows short, Gloucesters Al Cottone said he and his fellow fishermen seem to be facing the future in a sort of "state of shock.""Everyones in denial. They still think, you know, someones going to come in on their white horse and save us," he said.The 2013 catch limit reductions come as science indicates key populations of bottom-dwelling groundfish -- such as cod and flounder -- are weak and recovering too slowly.In January, regional managers approved a broad slate of cuts in catch limits to rebuild fish stocks, including a 77 percent year-to-year reduction in catch of cod in the Gulf of Maine and 61 percent in the catch of cod on Georges Bank.Fishermen predict the range of cuts will kill the centuries-old fleet, while regulators acknowledge industry upheaval is ahead.The cuts follow a down 2012 fishing year thats seen fishermen catch well below their allotments on several key species.Thats proof, some have argued, that the fish are in trouble, and it also shows the coming cuts might not be as brutal as feared.For instance, the 61 percent year-to-year cut on the quota for Georges Bank cod doesnt look as harsh when the total allotment for the cod in 2013 is still more than fishermen are on pace to catch this fishing year.But fishermen say the cuts are so broad, and involve so many key species, that they simply leave the industry with too few fish to make a living. So the aim of many mitigation measures proposed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is to make more fish available to the fleet.For instance, regulators have proposed increasing catch allotments for healthier species, including white hake, dogfish and monkfish, which are alternative species for many groundfishermen.The winter flounder that swim in southern New England and the mid-Atlantic could again be available to catch for the first time since 2009, with regulators saying the species is now healthy enough to fish.Fishermen could also boost their quotas by transferring over a percentage of whatever they didnt catch from their 2012 allotments.One controversial proposal opens up segments of long-closed fishing areas off New England, so fishermen can better chase robust stocks that live there, including redfish and haddock.But thats strongly opposed by environmentalists who worry fishermen could devastate a last refuge for a struggling species. The issue wont be decided before May.Federal regulators have also pledged to find $6.7 million to cover the cost of hiring required at-sea catch monitors.The Northeasts top fishing regulator, John Bullard, said no ones pretending the proposals will help fishermen escape the pain of the cuts."Cushion the blow is probably the right term," he said. "Were not going to avoid the blow."Jackie Odell of the Northeast Seafood Coalition, an industry group, said the measures will help some fishermen, but most wont see much difference.Her group is seeking broader relief through the extension of emergency interim measures -- first enacted for 2012 -- that could significantly reduce the cuts on Gulf of Maine cod and haddock.Bullard, though, has been unconvinced, saying that its not legal and that easing the cuts will do nothing for fishermen or species that are clearly struggling.Massachusetts lawmakers are trying to go over Bullards head and have asked Gov. Deval Patrick to lobby his close friend President Barack Obama to get the interim measures enacted.Meanwhile, various requests for federal disaster aid for fishermen have circulated in recent months, so far to no effect.Odell emphasized that stocks are struggling even though fishermen havent exceeded their fishing limits for years.There is a fundamental problem with how fisheries are managed, she said, and the industry urgently needs support until changes can be made."People have got to be focused on opportunities and bridges, whether its money, whether its policies, whether its programs, whether its interim rules," she said. "What are people doing to help the industry?"Cottone, the Gloucester fisherman, said he hasnt a clue what hell do when May 1 comes. Hes also unsure of what, if anything, could make a real difference for an industry on the brink of disaster.Cottone said hes been allotted so few fish this year that he could hit his catch limits on all of them in a single tow. And then what?"No one knows what theyre going to do," he said. "Nobody."	2013-04-14

In bankruptcy and looking for cash, Detroit would like to lease its water utility to raise as much as $9 billion to fund basic services long term.ReutersA coalition of activist groups took the rare step Monday and appealed to the United Nations over reports that cash-strapped residents in Detroit are being left without access to water.The appeal to the U.N.’s special rapporteur comes after reports that nearly half of the Detroit Water and Sewerage customers are delinquent on their bills and owe the department about $118 million. The department has reportedly started shutting off water to these delinquent customers.ADVERTISEMENTBeside the amount due, the city council last week approved higher rates for customers by more than $5 per month, The Detroit Free Press reported. Those additional funds would help repair the antiquated system, the department said."I dont feel that residents should have to bear the burden of an increase right now,” Mary Sheffield, a councilwoman, told the paper.Maude Barlow, who put together the U.N. appeal, said if the U.S. does not respond to a U.N. intervention, it could impact its U.N. Universal Periodic Review. The review keeps records of all U.N. member states and their human rights obligations.The Hamilton Spectator summed up the news: "Desperate calls for help from the United Nations aren’t just for war-torn and developing nations anymore."The water department announced in March it would go forward with shutting off water service to more than 150,000 delinquent users, or half its customers, The Detroit Free Press reported.The department wants the customers to make good on $118 million in outstanding bills, the report said."We do have programs that do help those that are just totally in need; can’t afford it," Curtrise Garner, a water department spokeswoman, told CBS Detroit. But, according to Garner, there are also people who can afford to pay the bill and who opt not to.  "We know this because, once we shut water off, the next day they are in paying the bill in full. So we do know that that has become a habit as well," she said.Kevyn Orr, the citys emergency manager, told The Detroit Free Press that he is exploring the privatization of the department 	2014-06-24

(AP Photo/Al Behrman)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Orders for U.S. durable goods tumbled 1 percent in May as demand for military equipment fell sharply. But excluding defense-related goods, orders actually rose, and orders in a key category that signals business investment also increased.The gains outside of military goods suggest business spending is picking up, which could give the economy a much-needed boost.ADVERTISEMENTThe Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders, excluding defense, rose 0.6 percent in May, after falling 0.8 percent in April. Orders for core capital goods, which reflect business investment, increased 0.7 percent, after a 1.1 percent drop.Factories reported higher demand for steel and other metals, computers, and autos. Orders for defense equipment surged in April, so the sharp fall in May isnt a total surprise. Durable goods are items expected to last at least three years.The figures come as a separate report showed that the U.S. economy contracted sharply in the first three months of the year, largely because of bad weather. The economy shrank 2.9 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, the worst showing since the first quarter of 2009, in the depths of the Great Recession.But most economists expect growth has resumed in the current quarter, partly because of rising manufacturing output. Most analysts expect the economy will expand by 3.5 percent in the April-June quarter.Factory production rose at a steady pace last month, according to the Federal Reserve, as manufacturers cranked out more cars, machinery, furniture, computers and appliances. More output of those goods points to rising demand from consumers and businesses.And auto sales reached a nine-year high in May as Americans ramped up purchases of SUVs and pickup trucks.A survey by the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, found that manufacturing expanded faster in May than in April. A measure of new orders also rose, pointing to further growth in output in the coming months.Manufacturers are hiring more to keep up with demand. Factories added 10,000 positions in May, and the average work week for manufacturing employees grew.	2014-06-25

The pace of gains has slowed as more homes have come onto the market, according to CoreLogic.ADVERTISEMENTOn a month-to-month basis, prices rose 1.2 percent from April to May. But CoreLogics monthly figures arent adjusted for seasonal patterns, such as warmer weather, which can affect sales.Prices increased the most in Western states, including Hawaii, California and Nevada.Home sales began to stall in the middle of last year after double-digit price increases and higher mortgage rates made real estate less affordable for many people.But sales rose last month as price gains have moderated and mortgage rates have dipped.Sales of existing homes climbed 4.9 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million homes, according to the National Association of Realtors.However, sales are down 5 percent year-over-year.The Realtors forecast that sales of existing homes will decline 2.8 percent this year to 4.95 million, compared with 5.1 million in 2013.Sluggish sales, in turn, will slow annual price gains this year to roughly 5 percent or 6 percent, economists predict.Prices rose in the 12 months ending in May in every state, CoreLogic said.

The holiday can cause an uptick in layoffs of bus drivers, cafeteria workers and other school workers during spring break. Those earlier increases caused the four-week average of applications, a less volatile number, to rise 4,500 to 324,750.ADVERTISEMENTWith the impact of the holiday fading, applications are returning to pre-recession levels. The average for April was 312,000 , the fewest since October 2007.

But an unusually bitter winter sent factories, hiring and consumer spending into hibernation.Now, as temperatures rise, the economy is regaining momentum. Factories are busier. Consumers are spending more. Banks are making more loans to businesses. Companies have bigger plans to invest in plants and equipment. And the improvement appears to be widespread across the country."The weather really played havoc. There were ice storms in Georgia. That is not something you see every day," said Michael Dolega, senior economist at TD Economics. "Now, as Americans have dug themselves out and everything has melted, youre going to get a bounce back."An index based on several leading economic indicators — including employment, consumer confidence, stocks and interest rates — shot up for the third straight month in March, the Conference Board, a business research association, said on Monday. The indexs 0.8 percent gain to 100.9 "suggests accelerated growth for the remainder of the spring and the summer," said Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist.Many economists expect the economy to grow at an annual rate of 3 percent or more from April through June, up from an estimated 1.3 percent the first three months of the year. The positive economic news has sparked a rally on Wall Street the past week. The Standard & Poors 500 index is up 0.9 percent for the year and is near its record close of 1,890 set April 2.Helping to drive the growth have been recent increases in manufacturing after tumbling in January. Factory production climbed 0.5 percent in March, after a 1.4 percent surge the previous month, the Federal Reserve reported last week. This suggests that manufacturers anticipate that demand from businesses and consumers will increase.After the winter slowdown, recovering motor vehicle sales have boosted revenue for companies such as Batesville Tool & Die in Batesville, Ind."We feel like the auto industry is all the way back from before the recession," said Jody Fledderman, the companys president and CEO. "The numbers we see are fully recovered from then. We expect to see 4 to 8 percent increases in the industry overall for the next three or four years."Weekly government reports on unemployment benefits show that most employers are prepping for stronger growth in the months ahead.Claims for jobless benefits are a proxy for layoffs. The four-week average for unemployment claims have plunged to a 6 ½-year low, according to the Labor Department.The most recent weekly average was 312,000 applications, down from 357,000 a year ago and the smallest average since October 2007, which was two months before the Great Recession started.The number of claims is consistent with job gains of "200,000-plus" this month, said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.That would be slightly better than the 192,000 jobs employers added in March and the 197,000 hired in February.Among those benefiting from a stronger job market is Courtney Ginder, 23. She found work almost immediately after graduating last year from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. She writes press releases, manages a corporate website and does other tasks for an Indiana company that helps manufacturers monitor their equipment remotely. "I love my job," she says. All of her Purdue friends, she says, also landed jobs in their field after graduation, too.Shopping has also recovered along with temperatures. March buying at general merchandise stores, such as Wal-Mart, Target and Macys, climbed at the fastest clip in seven years, the Commerce Department said last week.Total U.S. retail sales rose last month by 1.1 percent, led by purchases of autos and furniture.Consumers account for about 70 percent of all economic activity, making them a key driver of overall growth.The nearly 5-year recovery has been subdued, in part, because consumers have not experienced the wage growth to restore spending to pre-recession levels.However, households have reduced debt since the Great Recession of 2007-2009, giving them a bit more leeway to spend. Banks have unloaded the bad loans that piled up in the financial crisis and are lending again to businesses. The percentage of companies that increased their spending on capital equipment the first three months of the year was the highest in more than two years, and plans to increase capital investment also rose sharply, according to a survey released Monday by the National Association of Business Economists.A Federal Reserve survey released last week showed economic growth picking up across most of the United States over the past two months as the weather improved. Ten of the Feds 12 regions reported an increase in economic activity, according to the Beige Book survey. Only the Cleveland and St. Louis districts reported slower growth.The Fed has been scaling back its efforts to help the economy, deciding last month to reduce its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion. The $55 billion in purchases are meant to keep long-term interest rates low and to encourage borrowing and spending. Still, Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs more help. The Fed has kept short-term rates near zero.The Great Recession ended nearly five years ago. But unemployment remains high at 6.7 percent, and 3.7 million Americans have been out of work for six months or more.	2014-04-21

Heres a look at where things stand:COUNT THE VOTES:ADVERTISEMENTTens of thousands of creditors in different classes have until July 11 to vote on the citys proposed cure, but eyes mostly are on retirees whose modest pensions, averaging $19,000 a year, would be cut by 4.5 percent. They would also lose annual cost-of-living payments. Police and fire retirees, whose separate pension fund is healthier, would see only a small cost-of-living cut.POT OF MONEY:If the pension changes are approved, a surge of outside cash — $816 million — would flow from foundations, philanthropists and the state of Michigan to prevent any deeper cuts and protect city-owned art at the Detroit Institute of Arts. If the pension changes are defeated, the money disappears and cuts would be drastic.BANKRUPTCY TRIAL:Creditors dont get the final word in approving or rejecting a bankruptcy exit. Judge Steven Rhodes plans to hold a multi-day trial, starting July 24. His job is to determine whether the plan is "feasible" and in the best interest of creditors. The judge has his own experts to advise him. Rhodes can force the entire plan on creditors, from Wall Street to Main Street, even if they dont like what Detroit is proposing. To trigger "cram down," he needs only one class of creditors to vote in favor.PENSION SHIELD:Michigans constitution says a pension earned in a public job cant be harmed. But Rhodes in December said theres no such protection in bankruptcy — the most significant decision so far. It shifted momentum to the city and led to a series of closed-door talks to reach a compromise with retirees, unions and pension funds. State Attorney General Bill Schuette believes Rhodes is wrong, but hell drop a legal challenge at a federal appeals court if retirees vote to take the hit.	2014-06-08

The setback came after a huge increase in the previous month and should not raise concerns about an expected spring rebound in the economy.The Commerce Department says consumer spending fell 0.1 percent in April, reflecting reductions in purchases of durable goods such as autos and in services such as heating bills. The drop was the first in 12 months, but it followed a 1 percent surge in spending in March, which had been the biggest increase in more than four years.ADVERTISEMENTIncome rose 0.3 percent in April after a 0.5 percent March gain.The overall economy shrank in the first quarter, but economists expect a strong rebound this quarter.	2014-05-30

The government also revised up its estimate of the spending gain in February to 0.5 percent from 0.3 percent.ADVERTISEMENTPeople spent more on manufactured goods. Autos and furniture led much of the gains, according to a retail sales report released last month.Income rose 0.5 percent after rising 0.4 percent in February.Higher spending points to stronger growth because consumer activity accounts for 70 percent of the economy.

It marked the 11th consecutive increase in stockpiles and was the biggest advance since October. Total business sales were up a solid 0.7 percent in April after a 1.1 percent rise in March, which had been the biggest monthly sales increase in 10 months.ADVERTISEMENTThe encouraging sales gains are expected to prompt businesses to keep ordering more goods to restock their shelves. That rising demand should help boost factory production and fuel the overall economy.For April, inventories at the wholesale level climbed 1.1 percent, while inventories held by retailers rose 0.5 percent. Stockpiles at the manufacturing level were up 0.4 percent.Economic growth went into reverse in the January-March quarter with the economy contracting at an annual rate of 1 percent. However, much of that weakness reflected an unusually severe winter.Economists are looking for growth to rebound to an annual rate of around 3 percent or better in the current April-March quarter and remain at a 3 percent level in the second half of this year.Part of the optimism about growth reflects expectations that employers will keep increasing their hiring, with the extra jobs boosting incomes and supporting stronger consumer spending.The economy added 217,000 jobs in May, the fourth straight month of a gain of more than 200,000, something that hasnt happened since 1999. The unemployment rate remained unchanged in May at 6.3 percent, the lowest in more than five years.	2014-06-12

Its the largest number of job listings since September 2007.ADVERTISEMENTCompanies have been slow to fill openings since the recession ended, so the increase in postings wont automatically lead to more jobs. The report showed that the number of jobs filled in April, 4.7 million, was largely unchanged from March. In the past year, job postings have jumped 16.5 percent, while hiring has risen just 6 percent.But more job openings typically points to an improving job market. A separate monthly employment report on Friday showed the economy generated 217,000 jobs in May, while the unemployment rate remained at a five-year low of 6.3 percent."Todays report appears to confirm that the U.S. labor market has indeed shifted to a period of stronger growth," Jeremy Schwartz, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a note to clients.Almost all the gain occurred in the private sector, while government job openings rose slightly. The biggest increases were in retail, restaurants and hotels, which include mostly lower-paying jobs. Still, the professional and business services category, which includes higher-paying jobs such as accountants and engineers, also posted a big jump.There are now an average 2.2 unemployed people for each available job. Thats down from a peak of 6.7 in July 2009 just after the recession ended and close to the 2 to 1 ratio that is typical of a healthy economy.Tuesdays report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, offers a more complete picture of the job market. It reports figures for overall hiring, as well as the number of quits and layoffs. The monthly jobs figures are a net total of job gains or losses.The additional data illustrates turnover in the job market. Stronger job markets usually include a greater amount of churn, with more people quitting and greater overall hiring.In April, the number of people who quit or were laid off barely rose. More quitting can be a sign of confidence in the economy, since most workers quit only when they have another job or are confident they can get one. Quitting also opens up more jobs for the unemployed to seek.Tuesdays figures show that employers and workers are still relatively cautious. The number of people quitting has been rising slowly but is still below pre-recession levels.Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, has said the central bank monitors the job openings, quits and hiring figures as key indicators of the job markets health. The figures help the Fed decide how to manage short-term interest rates and other efforts to foster financial stability.	2014-06-10

Visa Inc. reports quarterly earnings on Thursday, April 24, 2014. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)The Associated PressVisa Inc.s profit jumped 26 percent in its fiscal second quarter from a year earlier as the company benefited from strong growth in payments volume, service revenue and a one-time tax gain.The latest earnings exceed Wall Street estimates, but revenue fell slightly short. Management said Thursday that revenue growth was hurt during the January-March quarter by a stronger U.S. dollar and one-time items.ADVERTISEMENTThe company projects that the same factors will have a slightly more pronounced impact on revenue growth in the third quarter, but added that it expects revenue growth will rebound in the companys fiscal fourth quarter.Shares of Visa fell more than 4 percent in after-hours trading.Foster City, Calif.-based Visa is the worlds largest processor of debit and credit card payments. As such, it benefits from heightened consumer spending, and its results are closely watched because they can be a window into the buying habits and financial health of consumers.An unusually bitter winter sent factories, hiring and consumer spending into hibernation earlier this year, but signs emerged last month that consumers started spending more. U.S. retail sales rose last month by 1.1 percent.In the first three months of the year, all credit and debit card transactions made on Visas network grew 4.7 percent to $1.73 trillion versus the same period last year. Of that, $690 billion came from U.S. transactions, a gain of about 8 percent.All told, the company processed 15.4 billion transactions during the quarter, up 11 percent from a year earlier.That helped boost Visas service, data processing, international transaction and other revenue for the quarter. At the same time, the company spent slightly more on client incentives.In all, Visas net income improved to $1.6 billion, or $2.52 per share, for the three months that ended March 31. That compares with net income of $1.3 billion, or $1.92 per share, a year earlier.Excluding the tax benefit, the company earned $2.20 per share in the latest quarter.Operating revenue rose to $3.16 billion from $2.96 billion a year earlier.Analysts polled by FactSet, on average, forecast earnings of $2.18 per share on revenue of $3.19 billion.Visa expects fiscal 2014 net revenue growth to range between 10 percent and 11 percent, citing the impact of currency exchange. It also affirmed its previous prediction for earnings growth.Shares of Visa ended regular trading up 58 cents at $209.40. The stock slid $9.89, or 4.7 percent, to $199.51 in after-hours trading.

Youd have to do some work,” explained Alexis Wiley, spokeswoman for Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. Repairs involving a lot of both structural and cosmetic work, as well as installation of appliances, hot water heaters and furnaces.“Youve got to make it a livable place, but when you consider what youre getting for that - youre getting into a great neighborhood with great neighbors,” Wiley told Fox News.While the starting price is $1,000, officials anticipate most of the homes will sell for at least $20,000.Winning bidders are required to rehab the home and bring it up to code within six months of closing, and either live in it or rent it out.Scott Northway was among more than a thousand potential buyers who toured the homes earlier this week, and among nearly 4,000 who’ve already registered to take part in the auction.“It could be a great opportunity to get a great home in a great neighborhood for a great value,” Northway said.The auction kicks off Monday on BuildingDetroit.org, with the first of 15 properties, though the mayor’s office expects at least several hundred more to be added in the next several weeks.Garrett Tenney is a correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).

Imports also rose but by a slower 1.1 percent to $234.3 billion, reflecting increased shipments of cellphones, clothing and other consumer goods and increased demand for heavy machinery and other capital goods.A smaller trade deficit can boost growth because it means U.S. companies are earning more on their overseas sales.	2014-05-06

Still, the index remains 7.9 percent below its level a year ago.ADVERTISEMENTPending sales are a barometer of future purchases: A one- to two-month lag usually exists between a signed contract and a completed sale.The gain in signed contracts partly reflects a recovery from the harsh winter.

Roughly 23 percent said it was mainly because they couldnt find a job, and 21 percent said it was specifically to care for home or family, the researchers noted, relying on census and other government data.By contrast, 1.1 million men were at-home dads in 1989, the earliest year reliable government figures are available for the sector.Gretchen Livingston, a senior researcher who worked on the report, said fathers comprised 16 percent of parents at home full time in 2012, up from 10 percent in 1989.The 21 percent who cited caring for home and children as the specific reason for being out of the for-pay work force was up from 5 percent in 1989 and 18 percent in 2007, the start of the recession, Livingston said.While unemployment is a factor overall, Livingston said Wednesday in a telephone interview from Washington, D.C., that the "continuing convergence of gender roles" between moms and dads is key."Its becoming more acceptable for dads to be caregivers, and its becoming more acceptable for moms to be responsible for breadwinning," she said.But Livingston warned that affluent, highly educated dads at home to raise children remain a subset."Its important to note that a lot of these dads are actually not doing that well economically and they tend to have lower income levels, too," she said.And despite a greater acceptance of dads staying home to raise kids, other Pew research shows 51 percent of the public believes kids are better off when the mother stays home, compared to 8 percent that cited dads."There clearly has been a lot of gender convergence in recent decades, but then at the same time, you know, some things havent changed as far as peoples perceptions of the roles," Livingston said.Mike Brandfon, 48, of Chicago falls into the laid-off category. He lost his job at a mid-size public relations company in December 2009, at a period when he and his wife had been thinking about having kids."I was looking for jobs but we just happened to get pregnant with twins at the right time, as far as me being able to stay home with them since I couldnt find a job," he said.After the girls were born in October 2010 and his spouses four-month maternity leave ended, her marketing job allowed them to just make ends meet."It was quite a shock, to say the least," he said of remaining out of the for-pay work force. "You dont think about it in that sense when youre going through it. You just try to get through each day and each moment."Brandfon joined a dads group for park outings with the kids and the occasional night out for a beer. Once the girls were nearly 3 years old, he began looking for work again and landed a job last September as media director for Web2carz.com, an online-only auto and lifestyles magazine.In the end, he was thrilled with his time home as primary caregiver."I couldnt get those years back," he said. "Looking back, it was amazing, seeing these little things develop into real people."___Follow Leanne Italie on Twitter at http://twitter.com/litalie	2014-06-05

Though a sizable increase, that was down a bit from Februarys 12.2 percent year-over-year increase.ADVERTISEMENTOn a month-to-month basis, prices in March rose 1.4 percent from February. But CoreLogics month-to-month figures arent adjusted for seasonal patterns, such as warmer spring weather.Home sales and construction have faltered since last fall, slowing the economy. A harsh winter, higher buying costs and a limited supply of available homes have discouraged many potential buyers. Existing-home sales in March reached their lowest level in 20 months.Some signs suggest that buying might be picking up a bit as the spring season gets underway. Signed contracts to buy homes rose in March for the first time in nine months, the National Association of Realtors said last week.Even so, economists forecast that sales of existing homes will barely rise this year from 2013s pace of 5.1 million. Sluggish sales, in turn, will slow annual price gains this year to roughly 5 percent or 6 percent, economists predict. CoreLogic forecasts that prices will increase just 6.7 percent in the 12 months that will end next March.Higher prices typically encourage some homeowners to sell, yet the number of homes on the market remains low. CoreLogics chief economist, Mark Fleming, said many homeowners might be reluctant to sell because theyve locked in low mortgage rates and are hesitant to buy a home with a higher-rate mortgage.The Federal Reserves bond-buying program helped reduce the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage to as low as 3.3 percent in early 2013. The average is now about 4.3 percent, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.Fleming calculates that about a third of homeowners with mortgages are paying rates below 4 percent. An additional 15 percent are paying around the current average of 4.3 percent. That means roughly half of homeowners with mortgages are paying rates at or below the current level — roughly double the percentage of a year ago.Home prices in California have jumped 17.2 percent from a year ago, CoreLogic said. Nevada, at 15.5 percent, has posted the second-largest gain, followed by Georgia, at 12.4 percent; Hawaii, 12.3 percent; and Oregon, 12.2 percent.The Riverside-San Bernardino, California, metropolitan area reported the largest price gain over the past 12 months: 20.9 percent. It was followed by Los Angeles-Long Beach, with a 17.1 percent gain; Atlanta-Sandy Springs, 14.1 percent; Houston-Sugar Land, at 13.7 percent; and Chicago-Naperville, 11.3 percent.Home sales and construction began recovering about two years ago after being hammered by the housing bust and Great Recession. But a jump in mortgage rates last spring caused sales of existing homes to start falling in the summer.	2014-05-06

Gravely’s company joined a program called a minority business accelerator even before he bought a controlling interest in the Cincinnati-based company in 2006. It helped the company get started and win contracts that have helped Triversity’s revenue double. (AP Photo/Al Behrman)The Associated PressNEW YORK –  Mel Gravely says his construction company might not exist today if he didnt have mentors to guide it.Gravelys company, TriVersity, joined a program called a minority business accelerator even before he bought a controlling interest in the Cincinnati-based company in 2006. It helped the company get started and win contracts that have helped Triversitys revenue double.ADVERTISEMENT"I dont make any move at all without getting the input of the accelerator," Gravely says.Minority business accelerators have launched in a handful of metropolitan areas in recent years as local businesses, chambers of commerce and economic development groups work to create more jobs and improve the quality of life in their regions. The Cincinnati accelerator, created by the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber in 2003, has inspired officials and business people in the Greenville, S.C.; Charlotte, N.C., and Newark, N.J. areas to start similar programs.A key goal of the accelerators is to help minority owned-companies win contracts with large companies. Despite the rapid growth in the number of minority-owned businesses — over 45 percent between 2002 and 2007, according to the Census Bureau — they struggle to get business with major companies. Many dont have the ability to fulfill million-dollar contracts, something the accelerators aim to change. But theres also a lingering perception that minority companies cant do the job or cant do it well, according to business owners and professors who study minority business. And although many minority companies can fulfill a contract, theres still resistance at many large companies to taking risks with a new supplier, no matter who owns it."Most people are not racist. They just dont like to change," says Crystal German, vice president of economic inclusion at the Cincinnati Chamber.WHAT ARE MINORITY BUSINESS ACCELERATORS?Accelerators help companies speed up growth. The programs focus on a small number of companies that have shown potential to succeed and create jobs. To be in the Cincinnati program, a company must already be well-established, have annual revenue of $1 million or more and have a business plan that shows it can grow significantly in the next two to five years. The goal is to help small companies grow into bigger ones so they can make a greater contribution to local economies."The theory is that the largest companies have the greatest potential to employ people, generate tax revenues, make charitable contributions and overall drive the economy," German says.Mentors at the accelerators act as advisers, meeting with company owners, helping them improve operations and build strategies. They also connect owners with big customers.Large corporations provide contract opportunities, mentoring or both. In Cincinnati, Fortune 500 members Macys Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. are among those that have given more business to minority companies."What we do is try and not only provide counsel for the accelerator, but also connect the dots, the needs of our company with those of suppliers that are coming up in their ability to deal with P&G and Macys," says Amy Hanson, a Macys vice president and head of the accelerators leadership council.In Greenville, Ava Smith has enrolled in the accelerator there because shes being approached by companies all over the U.S. and she wants to be sure she can handle all the new business that comes her way. The program is in its first year."You dont know what you dont know," says Smith, owner of Flat Fee Hiring, a 12-year-old recruiting company in Greenville. "Im going to the next level where I need to think like a CEO instead of a small business."WHY THEY EXISTLocal chambers of commerce and economic development agencies have launched accelerators to help minority businesses create jobs. Officials say the inability of minority companies to expand holds back a regions economic growth."Look at the number of minority business enterprises and how many are able to build jobs. Its grossly disproportionate from their majority counterparts," says Nika White, vice president of diversity and inclusion at the Greenville Chamber of Commerce.One reason for the disparity is that a small company may not have the infrastructure, such as computer systems, and the experience to operate on the level needed to fulfill a big contract, says Jeffrey Robinson, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at Rutgers University. He is working on the Newark accelerator."Theres a leap you have to take from the five-person company to a couple hundred, to being a multimillion-dollar company. You cant run them the same way," Robinson says.Minority-owned companies still arent getting the big contracts they should, says Leonard Greenhalgh, a professor of management at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. One of his specialties is minority businesses and their role as suppliers to larger companies. Big businesses tend to keep the same suppliers for years unless there are problems or a technological change, he says."Its white males buying from white males," Greenhalgh says. "Minority- and women-owned suppliers are both incredibly important to the future of the economy. Thats why you need accelerators. Those owners have the odds stacked against them."Theres also a perception in the business world that minority companies arent up to the task, says Gravely, the TriVersity owner. Other companies believe minority businesses may not be able to fulfill a contract because they dont have enough workers. Some believe that minority businesses arent professional enough."Ive got to overcome a negative perception — not negative to me personally, but generally. I have to prove a capability," says Gravely, whos also chair of the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.LIFE IN THE ACCELERATORIn Cincinnati, companies set long-range strategic plans with the help of their mentors. They meet at least four times a year and many are in touch regularly. Through the program, the companies learn how to become larger players. If needed, mentors help companies build a management team and change how they operate.During one of Germans meetings with TriVersity, she realized the company didnt have a formal budgeting process."She told us, thats a weird way to do your budget," Gravely recalls. "She wasnt mean about it, but she said, I have some suggestions," TriVersity revamped the way it did its budget, and ultimately hired a finance manager.Businesses are generally mentored for a year or more by accelerator employees and some big corporations that do business with minority companies.After nearly nine years in the Cincinnati program, the goals for World Pac Paper are still to grow through contracts or expansion."We work with them on their strategy every year, who theyre targeting, what industries theyre trying to get into, what products or services they want to add," says Denise deSilva Litter, a mentor in the program. "A lot of the work we do with (owner Edgar Smith) is conversation, what kind of companies should you look to acquire, do they have products similar to what your company already offer?"Litter, who has worked in corporate purchasing, and other mentors are in continual contact with the big corporations and organizations that agree to work with companies in the accelerator to find out about available contracts that might be a good fit."We dont encourage one of our portfolio companies to go after every single company in Cincinnati. We want them to fine-tune their strategy and their focus on who is the right company," she says.After a target is chosen, Litter helps a small business set up a meeting with the larger company and prepare its sales presentation.That was the appeal of the accelerator for Tillie Hidalgo Lima, the owner of Best Upon Request, a concierge services provider that has been in the program since 2010. Her company was already growing, but not thriving the way she hoped.The accelerator has helped her get contracts with Fifth Third Bank Corp. and the Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center."I saw the accelerator as something that could give us a lift," she says.Companies in the accelerator can also be mentored by some of the big corporations that work with the accelerator. When World Pac first began working with Macys shortly after Smith started it in 2004, the paper company was selling the retailer paper for newspaper advertising inserts and catalogs. As more customers have started shopping online, theres less need for paper and more for mailing cartons. The relationship with Macys has contributed to World Pacs shift to more of a cardboard supplier, and it is now making shopping bags for the retailer, Smith says."We had to scale up sooner than later and Macys, our first Fortune 500 customer, played a significant role in that effort," Smith says._____Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg	2014-04-16

Wall Street banks had sought an exemption and the leading Wall Street lobbying group expressed disappointment with the Feds move.ADVERTISEMENTThe Volcker Rule, adopted in December, is intended to limit banks riskiest trading bets that could implode at taxpayers expense. That kind of risk-taking on Wall Street helped trigger the 2008 financial crisis. Congress mandated the Volcker Rule in its financial overhaul law.The Fed gave banks until July 2017 to "conform" their holdings of the collateralized loan obligations, which are mainly backed by commercial loans.The Fed previously had given banks a one-year extension, to July 2015.Banks had contended that without an exemption, they would be forced under the Volcker Rule to shed their CLO securities at a disadvantage."Any forced selling of these securities will ... damage a key source of funding for Main Street businesses" by distorting market prices for the securities, Kenneth Bentsen, president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said in a statement.Dennis Kelleher, the president of Better Markets, a group that advocates strict financial regulation, said many of the securities in question will mature in a few years so banks wont have to sell them to comply with the rule.The banks lobbying for an outright exemption "was just a Wall Street politically manufactured issue," Kelleher said. He called the Feds action "a pretty narrow tweak" applied to a specific type of security.The rule is named for Paul Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman who was an adviser to President Barack Obama during the financial crisis. Volcker urged a ban on high-risk trading by big banks to diminish the likelihood that taxpayers might have to rescue them, as they did after the financial crisis.	2014-04-07

Donahue urged Cuba to deepen economic reforms on the island, and the US to take steps to normalize relations with the Caribbean nation. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa)The Associated PressHAVANA –  The head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has a prescription for communist-run Cubas struggling economy: less government control and a heavier dose of the open market.In a speech at the University of Havana, Chamber president and CEO Thomas J. Donohue cautiously praised what he saw during a visit to evaluate economic reforms that have hundreds of thousands of islanders working independently of the state.ADVERTISEMENTBut he added that the challenge now is to consolidate and expand the changes."We at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce believe in the power of private enterprise to help societies progress and improve," he said Thursday, before heading back to the U.S. "And it is in that spirit that we come to your country ... and offer these observations."About a dozen business leaders arrived this week on the chambers first trade mission to Cuba since 1999. During the visit they met with entrepreneurs and government officials to talk about the reforms, which President Raul Castro began in earnest in late 2010."We have come to Cuba to assess the seriousness of this effort and to encourage and support it in any way we can," Donohue said. "Were trying to engage Cubans of all walks of life and explain how private enterprise can dramatically improve the lives of your citizens."State television reported Thursday night that Donohue met with Cubas president. It showed images of the encounter, but did not say how long it lasted or what they discussed.About 455,000 islanders are currently running or working for private small businesses as a result of the reforms, and about 450 new non-agricultural cooperatives are operating autonomously."Their efforts to start their own businesses show that the spirit of entrepreneurship and enterprise is alive and well in the hearts of many Cuban citizens," Donohue said. "And indeed, when that spirit is properly encouraged and given the freedom to operate, the country as a whole can do much better."He cited China and Vietnams economic overhauls as a model for improving Cubans lives. "It can happen here, too."Cuba has also decentralized a number of bloated state-run businesses and undertaken a big port project west of Havana that seeks to turn the sleepy fishing town of Mariel into a regional shipping hub. An adjacent special economic zone aims to lure much-needed foreign investment.Island officials say they are not abandoning the socialist principles that have ruled here for more than 50 years, but rather are "updating" Cubas model to perform better in a globalized economy.Donohue disagreed with those back home who criticized the trade mission by arguing it would be a mistake to strengthen commercial ties with Cuba due to questions about its record on civil liberties and political freedoms.He said the Chamber of Commerce takes human rights concerns seriously, calling it an issue that should be part of a "constructive dialogue" between the U.S. and Cuba.He called for Washington to allow imports and exports of goods and services involving a number of sectors in Cuba, saying it would be in the interests of American citizens and U.S. business. He cited telecommunications as one area with great potential.Donohue said the chamber has lobbied for years to end the now 52-year-long U.S. economic embargo that bars most commerce between the two countries. Some exceptions exist for food and agricultural goods, but as Cuba turned to other partners such trade has fallen by nearly half in recent years to about $509 million in 2012, the most recent year for which officials figures are available."Changes take time, but if (President Barack Obama) wants to get it done before the end of his term, hes got two years," Donohue said. "And its going to take a while to do it, so hell have to get busy."___Peter Orsi on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Peter_Orsi	2014-05-30

Puskar, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Consumers increased their borrowing in February on autos and student loans by the largest amount in a year. But for a second straight month, they cut back on their credit card use.Consumer borrowing climbed $16.5 billion in February, up from a $13.5 billion gain in January, the Federal Reserve reported Monday.ADVERTISEMENTThe category that includes credit cards fell $2.4 billion after a $241 million drop in January. But this decline was offset by an $18.9 billion increase in borrowing in the category that covers autos and student loans, the biggest one-month gain since February 2013.The overall increase in consumer debt pushed total borrowing to a record $3.13 trillion.Gains in borrowing are seen as an encouraging sign that people are more confident and willing to take on debt.Increased household borrowing can fuel higher consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.The February decline in credit card borrowing marked the third decrease in the past four months. That continues a trend evident since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.Borrowing on credit cards plunged during that recession as consumers tried to lower their debt during a period when millions of people were losing their jobs and many people still working were worried about the threat of layoffs.Credit card borrowing started rising again in 2011 but the increases have lagged far behind the category that covers auto and student loans. Economists said that many households have become more cautious about taking on high-interest debt.Credit card debt in February was still 17.3 percent below its peak above $1 trillion reached in July 2008. Credit card debt stood at $854.2 billion in February, up just 0.5 percent from a year ago.The measure of auto loans and student loans in January stood at $2.28 trillion, up 7.7 percent from a year ago. It has been up every month but one since May 2010.A separate quarterly report on consumer credit done by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that student loan debt has been the biggest driver of borrowing since the recession officially ended in June 2009.The Feds borrowing report tracks credit card debt, auto loans and student loans but not mortgages or home equity loans.	2014-04-07

But the pace of buying is still weaker than last year, as higher prices and relatively tight supplies have limited sales.The National Association of Realtors says its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index rose 0.4 percent to 97.8 last month. The index remains 9.2 percent below its level a year ago.ADVERTISEMENTPending sales are a barometer of future purchases. A one- to two-month lag usually exists between a signed contract and a completed sale.The gain in signed contracts partly reflects the slight decline in mortgage rates and the economic rebound from the brutal winter. The number of signed contracts increased in the Northeast and Midwest month-to-month, more than offsetting declines in the West and South.	2014-05-29

While healthy, that is down from a 13.2 percent gain in January.ADVERTISEMENTAnd home prices fell in 13 of the 20 cities in February compared with the previous month. The index is not adjusted for seasonal variations, so those declines partly reflect weaker sales in the winter.In addition to bad weather, sales have been held back by a limited supply of available homes, which has forced potential buyers to bid up prices. Thats caused prices to increase even as sales have slowed. Sales of existing homes fell to their lowest level in 20 months in March.Still, with sales slowing, many economists forecast that price gains will keep dropping this year into the mid-single digits.Prices in Las Vegas dipped 0.1 percent in February from the previous month, the citys first monthly decline in nearly two years. And home prices fell 1.6 percent in Cleveland and 0.7 percent in Tampa, Florida. Both monthly drops were the largest for those two cities since January 2012.Las Vegas still posted the biggest 12-month gain, with an increase of 23.1 percent. But thats down from 24.9 percent in January. Many investors snapped up homes in Las Vegas after prices plunged in the housing bust, causing sharp price gains.Home sales and construction started recovering about two years ago after being hammered by the housing bust and Great Recession. But a jump in mortgage rates last spring caused sales of existing homes to start falling in the summer.Sales have now fallen in seven of the past eight months. But the sales decline in March was small and many economists said it showed that existing-home sales had likely bottomed out.Contracts to buy homes posted a healthy gain last month, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday. Signed contracts typically result in sales one to two months later, so the increase points to higher sales in the coming months.New home sales, meanwhile, plunged 14.5 percent in March to the slowest pace in eight months, according to a government report last week. A jump in prices contributed to the decline.The Case-Shiller index covers roughly half of U.S. homes. The index measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The February figures are the latest available.	2014-04-29

The sharp slowdown, while worse than expected, is likely to be temporary as growth rebounds with warmer weather.The Commerce Department says growth slowed to a barely discernible 0.1 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter, the weakest since the end of 2012 and down from a 2.6 percent growth rate in the October-December quarter.ADVERTISEMENTConsumer spending grew at a 3 percent rate. But the gain was dominated by a 4.4 percent rise in spending on services, reflecting higher utility bills. Spending on goods barely rose. Also dampening growth were a drop in business investment, a rise in the trade deficit and a fall in housing construction.	2014-04-30

The increase comes after applications fell to their lowest level since May 2007 two weeks ago.ADVERTISEMENTThe four-week average, a less volatile measure, dipped 1,000 to 322,500. The average reached a seven-year low of 312,000 last month. Applications are a proxy for layoffs, so the low levels suggest companies are cutting few jobs.The number of people receiving benefits fell to 2.65 million, the fewest since Dec. 1, 2007, when the recession began."Dont be disappointed," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a research note. "The trend is downwards, signaling faster payroll growth."The recent decline in firings has been accompanied by healthier hiring. Employers are adding more jobs, though unemployment remains at historically high levels.The economy gained 288,000 jobs in April, the most in 2 ½ years, and the unemployment rate plunged to 6.3 percent from 6.7 percent. But the rate drop occurred because fewer people looked for work. The government doesnt count people as unemployed unless they are actively searching.In the first four months of this year, employers have added an average of 214,000 jobs a month, up from 194,000 last year.The improved hiring may help boost economic growth for the rest of 2014. More jobs means more people with paychecks to spend.The economy grew just 0.1 percent at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, largely because cold weather kept consumers away from shopping malls and discouraged home and car sales. Data that has been released since then suggests that the economy actually contracted in the first quarter by as much as 0.8 percent, analysts say.Still, economists expect growth will accelerate to a healthy pace of about 3.5 percent in the second quarter, as consumer spending and homebuilding rebound from the cold weather. Growth may slow a bit in the second half of the year as the bounce-back fades. But it should top 2.5 percent for the whole year, economists forecast.	2014-05-22

Thats just above a seven-year low reached three weeks ago. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell to 311,500, the fewest since August, 2007.ADVERTISEMENTApplications are a proxy for layoffs, so the drop suggests companies are cutting fewer jobs. When employers are confident enough to keep staff, they may also step up hiring. That is a good sign ahead of Mays jobs report, to be released next Friday.The downward trend in layoffs also suggests employers have shrugged off a dismal economic performance in the first three months of the year. A separate government report Thursday showed that the economy shrank 1 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, due largely to the impact of freezing winter weather.Yet applications for unemployment benefits have fallen 10 percent since the year began, a clear signal that employers arent worried about a longer-term slowdown. Many economists expect growth will rebound to a 3.8 percent pace in the second quarter.Fewer Americans are also receiving benefits. The number of recipients declined to 2.63 million, the lowest level since November 2007.The decline in applications since the start of the year has been accompanied by a pickup in job gains, though unemployment remains at historically high levels.The economy gained 288,000 jobs in April, the most in 2 ½ years, and the unemployment rate plunged to 6.3 percent from 6.7 percent.

The job gain comes from a survey of businesses, the unemployment rate from a survey of households. Sometimes, the two conflict.The survey of businesses showed 288,000 more jobs. Yet the household survey, in calculating unemployment, found that 73,000 fewer people had jobs.Why did the unemployment rate sink? Because 806,000 fewer people were in the workforce. Many retired or ended their job hunts. And fewer-than-expected people began looking for work.The unemployment rate typically drops when fewer people seek work: If theyre not hunting for a job, theyre not counted as unemployed.All of which points to an underlying weakness in an otherwise improving job market."When you have a robust economy, you dont get these mixed messages," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the conservative American Action Forum.Here are five cautionary signs from Aprils jobs report:543,000 FEWER PEOPLE SEEKING WORKLets dive a bit deeper into that unemployment rate. People flow into and out of the job market each month. Some leave for school; others return, armed with a degree. Some quit to raise a family. Some apply for jobs after their kids start kindergarten. In April, the number of people who began looking for work fell off a statistical cliff.This suggests that the recovery lacks the kind of gravitational force needed to draw more workers back into the fold. Just 58.9 percent of the working-age population holds a job. Thats down from 62.9 percent before the recession began at the end of 2007."We do not yet have a jobs recovery that is strong enough to really pull people in," said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the progressive Economic Policy Institute.The number of people who began seeking work for the first time fell 126,000 from March to roughly 1 million. The figure for new grads and parents who began looking was even bleaker: Down 417,000 to 2.6 million.If those 543,000 people combined had all started looking for work in April, the unemployment rate would be 6.6 percent — a dip from Marchs 6.7 percent, rather than the plunge to 6.3 percent.NO HOUSING REBOUNDBuilders added 32,000 workers in April. But just 41 percent of them were for constructing homes. That share is usually around 50 percent. The lower figure likely reflects how much housing has cooled this year after a solid improvement in 2013. Sales of new homes plunged 14.5 percent last month, according to the Commerce Department.Fridays report suggested that homebuilding could remain sluggish."You see that in the hiring numbers," said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research. "You see it in the borrowing numbers. And you see it in the value of private construction put in place."HIGH SCHOOL GRADS AND DROPUTS LOSING OUTPeople whove never been to college — about a third of workers older than 25 — are struggling. More than 200,000 high school drop-outs lost jobs last month. So did 276,000 high school graduates. This group isnt sharing in a recovery in which college has become practically a pre-requisite. Only 54.3 percent of high school grads either have a job or are looking for one. Thats down from roughly 60 percent before the recession.FLAT WAGESAverage weekly paychecks didnt budge in April. They were $838.70, exactly as in March. Stagnant pay could slow growth, since about 70 percent of economic activity comes from consumers. They cant ramp up spending unless their wages rise. "Firms are hiring again, but we still need wages to rise faster if the economy is to really accelerate," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economics.45,000 MORE MEN WORKING TWO FULL-TIME JOBSImagine juggling two-full time jobs. About 198,000 men managed this balancing act last month — a sharp increase of 45,000 year-over-year. True, thats a small share of the 145.7 million working Americans. But it reveals something critical in an economy in which several million Americans cant land one job, let alone two.The number of Americans with two full-time jobs usually rises when times are flush and reliable employees are hard to find. Thats not true now. Nearly 3.5 million people have been jobless for more than six months. When people take a second job, they do benefit financially as individuals. Yet it means someone else is stuck on the unemployment rolls without any job. The trend suggests that many employers are writing off some of the unemployed in favor of those already holding a job."Thats 45,000 other people who didnt get a job," said Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute.	2014-05-03
541	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/05/20/188-percent-us-mortgage-holders-owe-more-than-their-homes-are-worth-research/	18.8 percent of US mortgage holders owe more than their homes are worth, research finds	WASHINGTON –  Nearly 10 million Americans remain financially trapped by homes worth less than their mortgage debts — an enduring drag on the U.S. economy almost seven years after the housing bust triggered the Great Recession.During the first three months of this year, 18.8 percent of homeowners with a mortgage — 9.7 million — owed more on their loans than their properties would sell for, according to online real estate database Zillow. Though that was an improvement from the 25.4 percent figure of a year ago, the share of such "underwater" homeowners is about four times the historic average.ADVERTISEMENTAn additional 18.1 percent of mortgage holders were "effectively" underwater: They had equity, but the proceeds from selling their home would be too low to recoup the sales costs and also put a down payment on a new property.The consequence is that few Americans are putting their homes on the market, thereby limiting the economic growth made possible by sales. Because of the shortage of homes being listed, bidding wars have inflated prices in parts of the country to levels that squeeze out many first-time and middle class buyers.The problem is most pronounced among starter homes with prices averaging around $100,000, 30.2 percent of whose owners are burdened by underwater mortgages, sometimes called negative equity."The unfortunate reality is that housing markets look to be swimming with underwater borrowers for years to come," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow.The share of mortgage holders with negative equity is projected to drop to 17 percent at the start of next year, according to Zillow.Several major U.S. metro areas are stuck with residents who have high rates of negative equity. In Chicago, almost 45 percent are underwater or effectively underwater. The rate is 53.1 percent in Atlanta, 50.6 percent in Las Vegas, 46.6 percent in Charlotte, 44 percent in St. Louis, and 43.2 percent in Tampa.Sales of existing homes have slowed after strong growth in the first half of 2013. Americans bought homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.59 million in March, the lowest level since July 2012, according to the National Association of Realtors. It was the seventh drop in eight months.Nationwide, the median sales price in March was $198,500, up 7.9 percent year-over-year.There were nearly 2 million homes for sale at the end of March. But at the current sales pace, thats enough to last only 5.2 months, below the 6 months supply thats considered normal.The Realtors will release April sales figures on Thursday. Economists surveyed by FactSet expect a slight 2.2 percent increase in the annual sales rate to 4.69 million.	2014-05-20

He paid into Social Security as he meandered through a half-dozen jobs in telecommunications and networking. But he lost his last job in what he calls an age-related layoff. And his income on disability isnt enough to cover his expenses.So Catholic Charities gave him a place to live at Village Crossroads near Baltimore, which receives funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.In the aftermath of the Great Recession, millions of Americans are in a similar situation — or at risk of it. Many never saved enough to begin with, then lost their jobs or saw their wages stagnate when the economy collapsed.The result is that Americans are at least $6.8 trillion short of what they need to have saved for a comfortable retirement, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security. For those on the eve of retirement — ages 55 to 64 — the shortfall comes to $113,000 per household.Retirement experts worry that many will require extra government help in old age — the kind of services Village Crossroads provides.Helen Hatchell couldnt walk when she moved into Village Crossroads in July. Hatchell, a widow who cleaned office buildings before retiring and is now entirely dependent on Social Security, underwent a series of operations. Now, she can get around on her own and keeps herself busy by sewing."You gotta live or you gotta die," she says, "and I wanna live."	2013-12-29

More than half those jobs came from companies with fewer than 250 employees, Yellen tells small business owners in a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.ADVERTISEMENTYellen says the Fed has tried to foster the conditions for job creation by keeping interest rates near historic lows, but that "overwhelmingly, it is businesses that create jobs."By contrast, governments have shed 2.6 percent of their workers since early 2010.	2014-05-15
543	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/04/12/beef-prices-reach-highest-level-since-187/	Beef prices reach highest level since 1987	July 25, 2012: In this file photo butcher Freddie Quina cuts meat at Super Cao Nguyen in Oklahoma City.APLUBBOCK, Texas –  The highest beef prices in almost three decades have arrived just before the start of grilling season, causing sticker shock for both consumers and restaurant owners -- and relief isnt likely anytime soon.A dwindling number of cattle and growing export demand from countries such as China and Japan have caused the average retail cost of fresh beef to climb to $5.28 a pound in February, up almost a quarter from January and the highest price since 1987.ADVERTISEMENTEverything thats produced is being consumed, said Kevin Good, an analyst at CattleFax, a Colorado-based information group. And prices likely will stay high for a couple of years as cattle producers start to rebuild their herds amid big questions about whether the Southwest and parts of the Midwest will get enough rain to replenish pastures.Meanwhile, quick trips to the grocery store could drag on a little longer as shoppers search for cuts that wont break the budgets. Patrons at one market in Lubbock seemed resigned to the high prices, but not happy."I quit buying steaks a while ago when the price went up," said 59-year-old Lubbock resident Len Markham, who works at Texas Tech. She says she limits red meat purchases to hamburger, opting for chicken, pork and fish instead.Fellow Lubbock resident Terry Olson says she buys chicken and eggs now."I dont buy (red) meat, period," the 67-year-old said, admitting theres an occasional hamburger purchase. "Not like I used to because of the price."Restaurant owners, too, must deal with the high prices. Mark Hutchens, owner of the 50 Yard Line Steakhouse in Lubbock, raised his menu prices for beef items by about 5 percent in November. Since then, the owner of the eatery has tried to make cuts elsewhere to avoid passing it on to customers."It really squeezes the small guys more," he said of non-chain restaurants. "You just cant keep going up on people forever. I just think you have to stay competitive and keep your costs low."White-tablecloth restaurants have adjusted the size of their steaks, making them thinner to offset the price increases, says Jim Robb, director of the Colorado-based Livestock Marketing Information Center. Some places now serve a 6-ounce sirloin, compared to 8- or 10-ounce portions offered years ago, he said.And fast-food restaurants are trimming costs by reducing the number of menu items and are offering other meat options, including turkey burgers, Robb said. Chain restaurants also try to buy in volume as much as they can, which essentially gives them a discount, Iowa State University assistant economics professor Lee Schulz said."That can help them when theyre seeing these higher prices," he said. "They cant do anything with the high prices."The high prices are welcome news for at least one group: ranchers, especially those in Texas who for years have struggled amid drought and high feed prices. Despite the most recent numbers that show the fewest head of cattle in the U.S. since 1951, prices for beef havent declined along with the herd size as demand has remained strong.But even as ranchers breathe a sigh of relief, some worry lasting high prices will prompt consumers to permanently change their buying habits -- switching to chicken or pork. Pete Bonds, a 62-year-old Texas rancher and president of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, said thats a big concern, especially as younger consumers start to establish themselves.But such fears may be unfounded, Robb said. Three years ago, economists thought consumers would start finding substitutions for beef as the drought spread. "Were surprised we havent seen more of that," he said.South Dakota rancher Chuck OConnor is optimistic that consumers wont abandon beef for good."Im sure some are maybe going to cut back some, but to say that people arent going to buy it anymore, I dont think thats going to happen," he said, adding, "I hope not."Beef isnt the only meat with higher price tags. The price of pork also has climbed, largely due to a virus that has killed millions of young pigs. And composite retail prices for chicken in February were $1.95 per pound, the highest since October."I think these higher food prices are here to stay, including beef," said Dale Spencer, a rancher in central Nebraska and the former president of the Nebraska Cattle Association. "As we grow the herd, well have more supplies and prices should drop some at the market. I would not say a drastic drop."The long-term trend, Good said, is that more shoppers will choose cheaper hamburger over higher-priced steaks and roasts."Theres concern for the future but whats the consumer to do?" he said. "Pay the price or do without."	2014-04-12
582	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/07/08/us-companies-increasingly-turning-to-temporary-workers-to-fill-positions/	US companies increasingly turning to temporary workers to fill positions	In this May 9, 2013 file photo, a worker pushes shopping carts in front of a Wal-Mart store in La Habra, Calif. From Wal-Mart to General Motors to PepsiCo, companies are increasingly turning to temporary workers and to a much larger universe of freelancers, contract workers and consultants.APHiring is exploding in the one corner of the U.S. economy where few want to be hired: Temporary work.From Wal-Mart to General Motors to PepsiCo, companies are increasingly turning to temps and to a much larger universe of freelancers, contract workers and consultants. Combined, these workers number nearly 17 million people who have only tenuous ties to the companies that pay them — about 12 percent of everyone with a job.ADVERTISEMENTHiring is always healthy for an economy. Yet the rise in temp and contract work shows that many employers arent willing to hire for the long run.The number of temps has jumped more than 50 percent since the recession ended four years ago to nearly 2.7 million — the most on government records dating to 1990. In no other sector has hiring come close.Driving the trend are lingering uncertainty about the economy and employers desire for more flexibility in matching their payrolls to their revenue. Some employers have also sought to sidestep the new health care laws rule that they provide medical coverage for permanent workers. Last week, though, the Obama administration delayed that provision of the law for a year.The use of temps has extended into sectors that seldom used them in the past — professional services, for example, which include lawyers, doctors and information technology specialists.Temps typically receive low pay, few benefits and scant job security. That makes them less likely to spend freely, so temp jobs dont tend to boost the economy the way permanent jobs do. More temps and contract workers also help explain why pay has barely outpaced inflation since the recession ended.Beyond economic uncertainty, Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, thinks more lasting changes are taking root."Theres been a generational shift toward a less committed relationship between the firm and the worker," Harris says.An Associated Press survey of 37 economists in May found that three-quarters thought the increased use of temps and contract workers represented a long-standing trend.Typical of that trend is Latrese Carr, who was hired by a Wal-Mart in Glenwood, Ill., two months ago on a 90-day contract. She works 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., helping unload trucks and restocking shelves. Her pay is $9.45 an hour. Theres no health insurance or other benefits.Carr, 20, didnt particularly want the overnight shift."I needed a job," she says.The store managers have said some temps will be kept on permanently, Carr says, depending on their performance.Carr isnt counting on it.The trend toward contract workers was intensified by the depth of the recession and the tepid pace of the recovery. A heavy investment in long-term employment isnt a cost all companies want to bear anymore."Theres much more appreciation of the importance of having flexibility in the workforce," says Barry Asin of Staffing Industry Analysts, a consulting firm.Susan Houseman, an economist at the Upjohn Institute of Employment Research, says companies want to avoid having too many employees during a downturn, just as manufacturers want to avoid having too much inventory if demand slows."You have your just-in-time workforce," Houseman says. "You only pay them when you need them."This marks a shift from what economists used to call "labor hoarding": Companies typically retained most of their staff throughout recessions, hoping to ride out the downturn."We clearly dont have that anymore," says Sylvia Allegretto, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley.The result is that temps and contract workers have become fixtures at large companies. Business executives say they help their companies stay competitive. They also argue that temp work can provide valuable experience."It opens more doors for people to enter the labor market," says Jeff Joerres, CEO of ManpowerGroup, a workplace staffing firm.But Housemans research has found that even when jobs are classified as "temp to permanent," only 27 percent of such assignments lead to permanent positions.About one-third of temporary workers work in manufacturing. Temps can be found on production lines, repairing machinery and stocking goods in warehouses. About a fifth are administrative.Shortages of doctors and nurses have led some hospitals to turn to temp agencies. Staffing Industry Analysts forecasts that spending on temporary doctors will grow 10 percent this year and next.Some school districts now turn to temp firms for substitute teachers. This lets them avoid providing retirement benefits, which union contracts might otherwise require.Manufacturing unions have pushed back against the trend, with limited success."We run into this across all the various industries where we represent people," says Tony Montana, a spokesman for the USW, which represents workers in the steel, paper, and energy industries.Todd Miller, CEO of software company Gwabbit in Carmel Valley, Calif., says about a third of his 20 employees are temporary. An additional one-third are contractors.He says hes had no trouble filling such positions. People are "willing to entertain employment possibilities that they would not have six or seven years ago," Miller says.If the economy were to accelerate, Miller says he might hire more permanent staff. But "I dont have tremendous confidence in this economy."Only the health care and leisure and hospitality sectors have added more jobs during the recovery. But each is roughly five times as large as the temp industry. The proportion of all jobs in the temp industry is about 2 percent, just below a record set in 2000.Temp hiring has accelerated even though the economy has 2.4 million fewer jobs than it did five years ago. Temp jobs made up about 10 percent of jobs lost to the recession. Yet theyve made up nearly 20 percent of the jobs gained since the recession ended.A survey of companies with more than 1,000 employees by Staffing Industry Analysts found they expect 18 percent of their workforces to be made up of temps, freelancers or contract workers this year, up from 16 percent in 2012.Shane Watson, who in November lost a job providing tech support for Blackberry maker Research In Motion, says contract work has helped him recover. Hes on his third such position. Still, Watson, 36, misses the security of a permanent job.Wal-Mart says its been hiring disproportionately more temporary workers. "Flexible associates," it calls them. Spokesman Dave Tovar says temps allow store managers to provide permanent workers with more reliable schedules.Online competitors are seeking to upend the temp industry just as Amazon and eBay disrupted retail. Employers spent $1 billion last year hiring workers for short-term projects through online labor exchanges, such as oDesk and Elance, according to Staffing Industry Analysts. Thats 67 percent more than in the previous year.Freelancers in the online exchanges can be evaluated by employers, post portfolios and take online tests to demonstrate their abilities.Gary Swart, CEO of oDesk, says his clients are mainly small or startup companies. But giants like AOL and Unilever are using the service, too.When Hans Hess of Arlington, Va., was seeking a lawyer to do a trademark search for his Elevation Burger chain, he turned to Elance. He found a lawyer to do it for under $500."When I was using a big law firm, it could cost me $5,000 to get to the point of just filing a trademark," Hess says.Gigwalk recruits temps for brief projects in retail, merchandising and marketing. Anyone who downloads Gigwalks app can see pinpoints on a map signifying available jobs nearby.Frito-Lay, a division of PepsiCo, used Gigwalk this year to hire workers to check in-store displays of its products to ensure that a seasonal promotion was being handled properly."You can hire 10,000 people for 10 to 15 minutes," says Gigwalk CEO Bob Bahramipour. "When theyre done, those 10,000 people just melt away."	2013-07-08

The uniforms are built around the competition jacket with squares of stars, stripes and plaids. (AP/Burton)The newly-unveiled uniforms for the U.S. Olympic snowboarding team are star-spangled and red, white and blue — but theyre not made in America.The hodgepodge design, which designer Burton Snowboards says was inspired by a vintage quilt, features the faded colors of Old Glory and stars on the shoulder, base-layer henleys, hats and gloves. But like Ralph Lauren, which designed U.S. Olympic gear for the 2012 games in London, Vermont-based Burton is now defending its decision to use a global set of vendors to complete the job ahead of the Sochi Games, which begin on Feb. 7.ADVERTISEMENT“To achieve this level of performance and function, Burton turned to its best, long-standing and most trusted technical partners around the world to produce the uniforms, to ensure that our high technical and design standards were met,” Burton Snowboards said in materials obtained by FoxNews.com. “For example, the original quilt was sourced in the U.S. and brought back to Vermont to be deconstructed and reconstructed for jacket fabrication with Vermont-based designers.”- Burton SnowboardsThe quilt was then sent to Japan for final technical fabrication, company officials said.“The fabric of the competition fleece was woven in Italy, and the technical and waterproof corduroy pant fabric was developed in Taiwan and sewn in Vietnam,” the statement continued. “Next, we turned to our longstanding, trusted vendors in China to produce several of the accessories.”The statement continued: “And finally, the majority of the actual snowboards that the Burton athletes will ride in Sochi are being handmade in Vermont at Burton Headquarters in Burlington. As a global sport, snowboarding knows no borders. We’re proud that we used our best vendors from around the world, including our own Craig’s facility in Burlington, Vt., to ensure our American riders have the highest-performance gear during one of the biggest competitions of their lives.”The Sochi Games will mark the third Winter Olympics where Burton partnered with the U.S. Ski & Snowboard Association to create uniforms for the U.S. Snowboarding team. The primary focus of this year’s design, according to company materials, was “technical performance” above all.“As such, every piece of the uniform has to perform at the highest level and keep the athletes warm and dry in the unpredictable weather conditions that could come in Sochi,” Burton’s statement continued.Greg Dacyshyn, chief creative officer of the company, said in a statement that the design continues Burton’s legacy of fun, unconventional outerwear."The vintage quilt and flag print of the jacket combined with the corduroy pants give the uniform an heirloom hippie vibe that lines up with snowboardings laid-back culture while paying respect to Americas longstanding creative heritage,” Dacyshyn said. “It will stand out in Sochi for sure.”In 2012, Ralph Lauren was widely criticized after it was revealed that uniforms for U.S. athletes at the 2012 London Summer Olympics were made in China as the American textile industry continued to struggle. That decision prompted sharp words from some members of Congress, including Republicans and Democrats alike."I am so upset," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters in July 2012. "I think the Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves. I think they should be embarrassed. I think they should take all the uniforms, put them in a big pile and burn them and start all over again."Reid continued: "If they have to wear nothing but a singlet that says USA on it, painted by hand, then thats what they should wear."At least snowboarding fanatic contacted by FoxNews.com, however, said they didn’t have much of a problem with the news.“With nationalistic bravado at an all-time high, it makes sense that some people might be appalled at a country’s uniform not being made there,” wrote Avran LeFeber of AngrySnowboarder.com. “They need to look past this. The world is a global economy and, as such, it just isnt feasible to make a product 100 percent in one place. About 80 percent of the world’s winter sportswear is made in the Asian marketplace for a reason: they have an established history of working with various textile materials. Burton wants the best for the riders and therefore went out to have the best materials, designs, and factories work on it. Will this make everyone happy? No, but the age-old statement of ‘You cant make everyone happy all the time’ needs to be used in this.”	2013-12-06

The company is also expanding its offerings online and improving a new "scan and go" shopping app so customers can immediately download coupons personalized to them.ADVERTISEMENTOfficials disclosed the moves Tuesday at a media event at its companys global e-commerce offices in San Bruno, Calif., located in Silicon Valley.The six-story offices, which house more than 1,000 employees ranging from engineers to merchandisers, includes (at)WalmartLabs, where many of the shopping innovations are coming from. It was formerly a webs analytics company called Kosmix which the discounter purchased in 2011 and then renamed (at)WalmartLabs.The offices are different from the staid, sprawling corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. Clearly, it looks like an Internet startup. On the floor housing employees at (at)WalmartLabs, some workers are playing ping pong and pool. On another floor, web analysts watch oversized screens of Walmart.com and Samsclub.com to track any technology problems with the site.The company conducts so-called "hack days" twice a year where most of the staff are allowed to pursue prototypes of their own liking. At the end of the day, they must show their work."We are tenacious about building the best-in-class e-commerce. Were developing a density of talent that understands competition at Internet speed," said Neil Ashe, who joined the discounter as president and CEO of the companys global e-commerce division in January 2012. He had been president of CBS Interactive where he oversaw such online properties as cbs.com and CNET.com.Wal-Mart used the one-day event to showcase how the discounter is meeting the challenges to fight off online rivals like eBay Inc. and amazon.com, which have been luring shoppers to the Web with their vast offerings of products and low prices. But the discounter is also following its own customers. More than half of its shoppers have smartphones and one third of its online traffic now comes from smartphones. For the holiday shopping season, that percentage figure was up to 40 percent.Over the past year, Wal-Mart has been launching a number of initiatives that merge its online business with the power of its 4,000 stores. Thats all with the purpose of meeting the companys overall mission of "saving people money so they can live better." That includes same-day delivery in five markets, and an app that allows shoppers to scan their purchases with an Apple device while in the aisle and then pay at a self-checkout terminal. In 10 months, it also rebuilt its search engine from scratch, and the improved search tool has resulted in an increase of the number of browsers to buyers on walmart.com by 20 percent.Wal-Mart doesnt break down its e-commerce sales for the U.S., but officials reiterated Tuesday that it expects global e-commerce sales to hit $9 billion this year. Thats still a small fraction of the companys overall sales of $443.8 billion in the latest year ended Jan. 31. But the company is fast expanding its global presence which include nine other countries outside the U.S. Its also making big improvements to its ranking among shoppers. For example, in Brazil, walmart.com is now the most popular retail website in terms of traffic, up from being ranked No. 8 last year. And the company is creating a global platform so that lessons in Brazil can be quickly adopted in other countries.As for Wal-Mart.coms U.S. business, which sells more than 2 million items — including products it sells through other retailers like ebags.com — the company plans to expand the number of items. It didnt disclose by how much.With the test of the new lockers, Wal-Mart is catering to shoppers who want to be left alone when they buy. Joel Anderson, president and CEO of walmart.coms U.S. division, says that 75 percent of its shoppers want to buy interrupted.The new tests with lockers work like this: once shoppers buy the product online, theyre emailed a password. They then can go to the store to pick up the items that are stored in the locker. Anderson says that lockers will vary in size, and the company is still figuring out where to locate them.The service is an evolution of another shopping option called "site to store" launched in 2007 where shoppers can order online and then pick up the items at a special counter within two weeks. The company has also been testing an option where shoppers can pick up their purchases they bought online at select FedEx locations."The customer is in charge," Anderson. "The customer wants to control their own environment."	2013-03-26

The April increase was lower than economists had expected, but the government revised March activity higher to a 0.6 percent gain, up from an initial estimate of a 0.2 percent increase.ADVERTISEMENTIt marked the third straight increase after severe winter weather pushed spending down 0.4 percent in January.Construction activity was a drag on the overall economy in the first quarter when the economy actually shrank, but analysts are looking for a strong spring rebound.	2014-06-02

"Its right in line with expectations."Hamm, an early believer in the Bakken, estimated the rich cache holds more than 20 billion barrels of oil and technology continues to improve to help recover it."This is tight rock and its quite a job to wring barrels out of it," he said.Experts had known for decades that the Bakken held millions of barrels of crude, but it wasnt until oil prices reached record levels that the technology was developed to the point of being able to exploit the formation.The Bakken encompasses some 25,000 square miles in North Dakota, Montana, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. About two-thirds of the acreage is in western North Dakota.\n DARK SIDE OF NORTH DAKOTA OIL BOOMUnlocking the once-perplexing formation has propelled North Dakota from the nations ninth-largest oil producer in 2006 to No. 2, behind Texas.The Bakken and the Three Forks formation directly below it account for about 94 percent of North Dakotas current oil production, which is nearing 1 million barrels a day, said Alison Ritter, a North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources spokeswoman. Three Forks production is counted toward Bakken production.Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said the milestone of a billion barrels of oil is less important than the Bakkens economic impact on the region."Barrels are just barrels," said Ness, whose group represents more than 500 companies working in North Dakotas oil patch. "Its that long-term investment thats important. The Bakken has been a huge asset to the state, the region and the nation."North Dakota began producing oil in 1951, when crude was struck on a wheat farm near Tioga in the northwest part of the state. The state tallied its 1 billionth barrel of oil in 1989 and the 2 billionth barrel in 2011. The state is on track to tally its 3 billionth barrel of oil this year or next, Ritter said.Jim Halvorson, a petroleum geologist with the Montana Board of Oil and Gas, said his state has produced 1.8 billion barrels of oil since 1916.The U.S. Geological Survey has called the Bakken the largest continuous oil accumulation it had ever assessed. The agency, which bases its data largely on information from oil company and state drilling records, said up to 7.4 billion barrels of oil could be recovered from the Bakken and the underlying Three Forks using current technology.Geologists and oil companies have mixed opinions on whether the Three Forks is a separate formation or acts as a trap, catching oil that leaks from the Bakken shale above. Some say it could be a combination of both.To capture crude from the formations, companies drill down nearly two miles then angle the well sideways for about another two to three miles. A pressurized concoction of water, chemicals and grit is injected to break open oil-bearing rock, which allows the oil to flow to the well.That technique, known as hydraulic fracturing or fracking, has been blamed for endangering water quality in some states. North Dakota regulators say the states water sources are protected by thousands of feet of geologic formations atop fracturing operations.	2014-04-30

Thats the lowest level since 1994, credit reporting agency TransUnion said Tuesday.ADVERTISEMENTThe April-June card delinquency rate declined from 0.63 percent in the same period last year, and also was down from 0.69 percent in the first three months of the year.The latest late-payment rate is the second-lowest recorded by TransUnion since the second quarter of 1994, when the rate was 0.56 percent, and its running ahead of the historical average of 1.03 percent. The firms records go back to 1992.Many Americans remain reluctant to take on high-interest credit card debt after taking steps to increase savings and pay down balances during the Great Recession.Americans credit card debt dropped $2.7 billion in June and remains 16.5 percent below its July 2008 peak, according to the Federal Reserve.Nearly four years after the recession, the U.S. economy and job market are far from fully recovered, though they are making steady progress.On average, employers have added 192,000 new jobs a month so far this year. And the unemployment rate fell to a 4 1/2-year low of 7.4 percent last month, down from 7.6 percent in June. Thats still well above the 5 to 6 percent rate associated with a normal economy.The slow-growth economy, rising home values and a high-flying stock market have helped boost consumer confidence this year, but many Americans remain cautious with their credit."The data supports that consumers will continue to prioritize their credit card relationships over other credit obligations, and delinquencies should remain low into the near future," said Ezra Becker, vice president of research and consulting in TransUnions financial services business unit.Average credit card debt per borrower slipped to $4,965 in the second quarter from $4,971 in the same period last year, TransUnion said. Card debt rose from $4,875 in the first quarter.Meanwhile, the number of new credit card accounts opened by consumers increased in the first three months of the year.The data lags by a quarter, so the latest TransUnion figures cover the January-March period. They show that the number of new credit card accounts rose 5.6 percent from the same period in 2012.The share of cards issued to borrowers with less-than-perfect credit was essentially flat at 27.3 percent versus 27.4 percent a year earlier. Thats still well below the roughly 45 percent share of cards going to non-prime borrowers before the recession, however.In the VantageScore credit rating scale, consumers with a score lower than 700 on a scale of 501-990 are considered non-prime borrowers.	2013-08-13

At the same time, the U.S. housing market has emerged from a deep slump, aided by rising home prices, steady job growth and fewer troubled loans dating back to the housing-bubble days."Were still firmly on the road back to normal foreclosure levels, but continue to see the foreclosure problem persist in areas that had delays in the foreclosure process," said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac.Those areas generally include states such as Florida, New York and Illinois where the courts must sign off on foreclosures. Many properties that were delayed as state courts worked through a logjam of foreclosure cases got started on the foreclosure path earlier this year and got scheduled for public auction last month.All told, 30,023 homes in states where the courts play a role in the foreclosure process were scheduled for public auction last month, an increase of 10 percent from September and up 7 percent from October 2012.Traditionally, most homes lined up for public auction ended up going back to lenders, opening the door for the properties to be placed on the market as sharply discounted foreclosed homes.But the decline in completed foreclosures suggests many of the homes being auctioned are ending up purchased by investors.Many large investors are eager to buy homes at public auction, where buyers are required to pay cash. That means they dont have to compete against typical homebuyers who must finance the home purchase."You have an improving housing market so investors are back in the game," Blomquist said.Blomquist anticipates that completed foreclosures will increase modestly in coming months in states where courts handle foreclosures, but adds that more of those properties could also end up sold to investors at public auctions.An average of about 40,000 homes have been taken back by lenders every month this year through October. That puts the nation on pace for just under 500,000 completed foreclosures this year, down from 671,251 last year.Foreclosures peaked in 2010 at 1.05 million and have been declining ever since.	2013-11-14

The plan, which is subject to federal and shareholder approvals, is expected to close later this year. It would be the largest takeover of a U.S. company by a Chinese firm, valued at about $7.1 billion including debt.ADVERTISEMENTCommittee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said the proposed purchase of the Smithfield, Va.-based company raises many questions, including the impact on food safety and security. She also said the precedent-setting transaction prompts reservations about the government review process of foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies."Smithfield might be the first acquisition of a major food and agricultural company, but I doubt it will be the last," said Stabenow.She asked the Treasury Department to include both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration in the governments review of the sale."In the short-term, I know this deal looks good for our producers ... One pork company alone might not be enough to affect our national security, but its our job to be thinking about the big picture and the long-term for American food security and economic security," Stabenow added.The proposed deal comes at a time when China has had serious food safety concerns, some of which have included Smithfields suitor.Pope reiterated that the takeover isnt about importing Chinese pork into the U.S. and is instead a chance to export into new markets with its brands, such as Smithfield, Armour and Farmland.During his remarks to the committee, Pope also noted that the proposed buyout and Chinas growing demand for pork will be a boon for American agriculture and Smithfields 46,000 employees in 25 states and four countries. It also owns more than 400 hog farms and has contracts with more than 2,000 family farmers across the U.S."There should be no noticeable impact on how we do business in America and around the world, except that we will do more of it," Pope said. "This is a wonderful opportunity for the U.S. to do what it does best, which is to produce agricultural products and ship those around the world."He added that in turn would create jobs for American farmers to expand.The pending deal comes as Chinese investment in U.S. firms, while still comparatively low, has risen sharply in recent years.Daniel Slane, head of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, told the committee that its reasonable to expect a wave of Chinese investments into U.S. food and agriculture industry as "China becomes a global player and a fierce competitor in American markets." That panel was created by Congress to monitor bilateral economic relations and advise Congress and the executive branch on developments."This potential purchase is not a one off," Slane said in submitted testimony in which he warned it could be "Smithfield today" and others tomorrow or further down the road.	2013-07-10

Additionally, 35 percent reported rising wages and salaries at their businesses in the past three months, up from 23 percent in January.ADVERTISEMENTYet those who said they raised the prices they charge in the past three months remained unchanged at 20 percent, according to the latest NABE survey of 72 members, which was conducted between March 18 and April 1."It appears that businesses were not able to pass on costs increases, resulting in increased pressure on margins," the survey findings said.The quarterly survey by NABE is intended to gauge business conditions at members firms or industries. The April survey reflects first quarter results, as well as the near-term outlook.Despite the cost pressures, businesses seem more upbeat about the direction of the broader economy. The survey found that 80 percent said they expect the GDP to rise at least 2 percent over the next year. Nearly three-quarters also said they expect labor market conditions to improve, with unemployment easing to between 5 percent and 6 percent in the next one to three years. And over the next six months, 43 percent of respondents expect their firms to expand employment.Still, a majority expect wage growth to remain subdued, with growth of up to 3 percent over the next three years.The number of businesses that reported rising sales in the first quarter fell to 53 percent, down from 63 percent in the previous quarter. Jack Kleinhenz, president of NABE and chief economist at the National Retail Federation attributed the decline to "a very rough winter" in a statement.Capital spending rose for 38 percent of respondents, up from 28 percent in January. Meanwhile, those reporting rising profit margins during the period declined slightly to 32 percent, from 34 percent in the previous survey.Looking ahead to the coming quarter, 41 percent said they expect costs to increase up to 5 percent. Whether theyll be able to pass that on to customers is uncertain; 31 percent said they expect their businesses to raise prices. Thats down from the 43 percent who said they planned to raise prices in January, but still an elevated level from most of last year.	2014-04-21

The data is from 2011, the most recent year available.ADVERTISEMENTThe top compensation went to Anne McSweeney, campaign director at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, who was paid more than $1.2 million in 2011, and Susan Feagin, who earned more than $1 million as the top fundraiser at New Yorks Columbia University. Most of the money paid to each woman came in the form of bonuses after major fundraising efforts.More than two dozen other fundraisers that year were paid between $500,000 and $1 million. Some of the top-paying institutions were Yeshiva University in New York, City of Hope medical center near Los Angeles and the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.The study examined nonprofits that raised more than $35 million each and found that most of the top salaries for fundraisers were being paid by universities and hospital systems. Fundraisers in the arts, environmental groups and other nonprofits were earning less. The findings raise questions for some about how much donated money is being devoted to a charitys mission."You have a very small, elite group of fundraisers that are in extremely high demand that are becoming millionaires while raising funds for a public charity that is supported by taxpayers," said Ken Berger, president of the nonprofit watchdog group Charity Navigator.He said the high compensation for fundraisers defies what nonprofits were created for and what was intended when they were exempted from taxes to support the public good.Not all top charities pay top dollar, though, Berger noted. The American Red Cross, which raises $3 billion a year, paid its chief development officer just over $350,000.Universities and hospitals dont represent the majority of nonprofits, he said. But they take in the bulk of money donated to nonprofits, according to Charity Navigator data.Some observers said the increased pay for fundraisers came as nonprofits sought to replace money that was lost or declined during the past recession, particularly support from government and foundations.Lois Lindauer, a Boston-based recruiter who specializes in filling top development posts, said nonprofits need the best talent they can get to raise revenue, and talent costs money. She said she supports competitive compensation. But it hasnt always been this high."As time has gone by in the last 10 years, I think it has slowly accelerated," she said.Before the recession, some nonprofits got 80 percent of their support from foundations and government sources. Now thats down to 22 percent or less for some groups."The pressure is on," Lindauer said. "That gap has to be filled in some way."___Chronicle of Philanthropy: http://philanthropy.com/___Follow Brett Zongker at https://twitter.com/DCArtBeat .	2014-04-21

The government reports on job openings and labor turnover for October, on Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2013. (AP Photo/David Goldman, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  U.S. employers advertised the most job openings in more than five years in October, and the number of people quitting also reached a five-year high.The Labor Department said Tuesday that job openings rose 1 percent to a seasonally adjusted 3.93 million. That is the highest figure since May 2008, three months after the Great Recession began.ADVERTISEMENTAnd the number of workers who quit rose 2.5 percent to 2.39 million, the most since October 2008. More workers quitting can signal a healthy job market, because most of those people likely either have a new job or are confident they can find one.Total hiring, though, slipped 2.6 percent to 4.5 million after reaching a five-year high in September. Still, overall hiring has risen 5.2 percent in the past year.More hiring, job openings and quits point to a more dynamic job market. That trend creates more opportunities for people out of work or looking for a new job.Another positive sign in the report: Layoffs plunged 16 percent to 1.47 million, the lowest level on records dating to 2001. Still, while fewer layoffs are welcome, businesses need to step up hiring to more quickly reduce the still-high unemployment rate of 7 percent.Job openings remain just below the 4 million figure that is thought to be consistent with a healthy job market. And employers usually hire about 5 million people each month in a normal economy.The job market remains competitive, even though the competition is easing. There were 2.9 unemployed people, on average, for each available job in October. Thats down from a ratio of nearly 7 to 1 in July 2009, just after the recession ended. In a healthy economy, the ratio is typically 2 to 1.Other recent reports show that businesses are adding jobs at a solid, steady pace. Employers added 203,000 positions in November, the government said Friday. The unemployment rate fell to a five-year low of 7 percent. Job gains have now averaged about 200,000 for the past four months.Those figures reflect net payroll gains — the number of people hired minus those who were laid off, quit or retired. Tuesdays report on job openings and labor turnover provides more details than the monthly employment report.Both Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who has been nominated to succeed him next year, have cited greater overall hiring and quits as key signs of the job markets improvement.___Follow Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber	2013-12-10

That may not seem like a huge number, but considering there are only about 75 such tankers plying American ports now, it represents a genuine boat-building boom.ADVERTISEMENT“We haven’t seen something like this since the 1970s,” Matthew Paxton, president of the Shipbuilders Council of America said to FoxNews.com. “The movement of more oil has built up a real commercial shipbuilding renaissance.”- Matthew Paxton, president of the Shipbuilders Council of AmericaThe renaissance comes despite an economy that continues to struggle. Its because of a specific sector of the U.S. economy that is also booming: natural gas production. The fuel must be transported, even within the country, either by rail, pipeline or ship. And if it is by ship, the ship must be American-made and American-manned, according to the 1920s Merchant Marine Act, also known as the Jones Act.Paxton said that it is projected that up to 3.3 million barrels will be shipped out daily from the Gulf Coast by 2020, destined for ports along the east and west coasts, causing huge demand for tanker ships.“It could be higher as more and more tankers are built,” he said.With record amounts of gas and oil being extracted from shale by the process of fracking, the U.S. has seen an energy boom in recent years that has proponents calling it the Saudi Arabia of natural gas. Much of the fuel is being exported, but most is staying here, being distributed around the nation for domestic use.The Aker Philadelphia Shipyard recently announced that it invested a total of $115 million to construct four tanks and plans to build eight in total.“The shale revolution is creating industrial opportunities throughout the United States and specifically here in Philadelphia,” Kristian Rokke, President & CEO of AKPS, said in a recent statement. “This strategic opportunity allows us to capitalize on the increased demand for Jones Act tankers in a way that will transform APSI in the years ahead.”Constructing one tanker, which could be more than 600 feet long and nearly 200 feet wide, can cost upwards of $100 million. Once they are up and running, the ships more than earn their keep. Transport companies pay up to $100,000 per day over a five-year contract to lease them.Currently, the shipping industry contributes $36 billion to the economy.“We need another shipyard or two,” said Bob Flynn, president of shipbroker MJLF & Associates in Stamford, Conn., at the recent TradeWinds Jones Act Shipping Forum in New York.	2013-09-20

Many owners dont want to be away when their business is gaining momentum. And those with startups find its hard to tear themselves away when theyre nurturing a very young company.Cleary last took a vacation in 2008. His business was hurt by the recession because clients who were strapped for cash cut their marketing budgets. But this year, things have been picking up.He was supposed to leave on Aug. 5 for 10 days. Then in late July, a string of emails and phone calls began. There was something different about them. Instead of getting the usual requests for information from would-be clients, Cleary was hearing, how soon can we start?"Right now, I dont see any vacation. Ill have to take long walks with my dog, exercise or see movies," he says.Many owners who took a vacation last summer have opted to keep on working this year instead, according to a survey this spring by American Express. Forty-nine percent of the surveys participants said they planned to take at least one full week off during the summer. That was down from 54 percent a year ago, and a high of 67 percent in 2006, the year before the recession began.After five challenging years, Luckett & Farley, an architectural and design firm based in Louisville, Ky., has a full pipeline of projects. The firm is so busy that CEO Ed Jerdonek isnt taking a summer vacation, a big change from the past, when he would take at least one."Theres a lot of action taking place and finally, were beginning to see some exciting expansion," Jerdonek says.Most of the firms 80 employees are taking time off. But senior managers including Jerdonek are staying put because they oversee all the projects. Jerdonek says sacrificing time off goes along with being a leader."Ill get a vacation, but it wont be any time in the near future," he says.Scott Yates isnt planning a real break anytime soon because hes still in the process of building BlogMutt, a Boulder, Colo.-based company that provides content for blogs.Yates did go away for two weeks early in the summer, but spent almost the entire time working. He took one day off to go to a wedding and another day only because he was in an area where there was no Internet connection."It was not a time away from work," says Yates, co-owner of BlogMutt, "It doesnt really count."BlogMutt coordinates between 3,000 writers and clients who have websites but not enough time to keep a blog going. The company is in its second year, and revenue is up 600 percent. The staff of four is still creating processes to help the company handle its increasing workload. If Yates or his business partner took vacations at this point, he says the companys growth would be slow.The owners of Smashing Golf & Tennis cant take vacations this summer because theyre training new sales people for the companys line of active wear for women. They also are getting their spring styles ready and have to be around for last-minute orders — this is high season for golfers and tennis players."Im not sure I should leave knowing that the selling time is hitting now," says co-owner Kelly Daugherty. "We dont want to lose the opportunity to go to the next level."Without a break, Daugherty is constantly on the go, juggling the Chicago-based business and taking care of her three children."Ill be honest, I feel like it is taking its toll on my stamina," she says.But not all small business owners are skipping vacation to take advantage of new business. Some are working through the summer because sales are slumping.Castle Inks sales of printer ink and toner cartridges began falling earlier this year when Internet search engine technology changed. Those changes meant that the company fell in the rankings when customers searched for cartridge retailers. The company believes its decreased visibility sent revenue down by a third.Owner Bill Elward decided to forgo his familys vacation and spend the summer working on whats known as search engine optimization, which helps a company rank higher during a search on Google and other sites. Hes also trying to get more business with schools and companies."Trying to focus on all those things has left us with little time for vacation," says Elward, whose company is based in Greenlawn, N.Y. "Were really hoping to see the fruits of our labor this fall."	2013-08-21

The Commerce Department releases business inventories for March on Tuesday, May 13, 2014. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  U.S. businesses increased their stockpiles in March, and sales increased by the largest amount in 10 months.Stockpiles rose 0.4 percent after a 0.5 percent rise in February, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Sales in March jumped 1 percent, the largest advance since May, after a 0.9 percent increase in February.ADVERTISEMENTBoth months represented a solid rebound after a 0.9 percent sales decline in January that was blamed in part on the harsh winter weather.The two months of sizable gains in sales should encourage businesses to keep restocking to meet rising demand. That would mean increased orders to factories and rising production, which would lead to stronger economic growth.Many economists expect growth to rebound significantly in the second quarter after slowing sharply in the first.Inventories held by wholesalers increased 1.1 percent in March, while those held by manufacturers edged up a tiny 0.1 percent. Inventories at the retail level were unchanged.In the January-March quarter, the economy slowed to a lackluster annual growth rate of 0.1 percent, a slump that economists have attributed mainly to severe winter weather. A slowdown in inventory building subtracted 0.6 percentage point from first-quarter growth.Economists think the drag from slower stockpiling is easing in the second quarter as businesses respond to stronger sales.Many analysts think annual growth will be 3 percent or higher in the April-June period. In a separate report Tuesday, the government said retail sales rose just 0.1 percent in April, less than expected. But that followed a 1.5 percent surge in March.Economists are forecasting that annual growth will hold around 3 percent in the second half of the year. That pace could provide the strongest growth for the overall year since 2005, two years before the Great Recession hit.	2014-05-13

WASHINGTON –  Average U.S. rates on fixed mortgages declined this week for a third straight week. The low rates could give a boost to the spring home-buying season, which has gotten off to a slow start.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate for a 30-year loan eased to 4.20 percent from 4.21 percent last week. The average for the 15-year mortgage fell to 3.29 percent from 3.32 percent.ADVERTISEMENTMortgage rates have risen nearly a full percentage point since hitting record lows about a year ago.Warmer weather has yet to boost home-buying as it normally does. Rising prices and higher rates have made affordability a problem for would-be buyers. And many homeowners are reluctant to list their properties for sale.Home sales and construction have faltered since last fall, slowing the economy. A harsh winter, higher buying costs and a limited supply of available homes have discouraged many potential buyers. Existing-home sales in March reached their lowest level in 20 months.The increase in mortgage rates over the year was driven in part by speculation that the Federal Reserve would reduce its bond purchases, which have helped keep long-term interest rates low. Indeed, the Fed has announced four declines in its monthly bond purchases since December because the economy appears to be steadily healing. But the Fed has no plans to raise its benchmark short-term rate from record lows.Fed Chair Janet Yellen has told Congress that the economy is improving but noted that the job market remains "far from satisfactory" and that inflation is still below the Feds target rate. She said she expects the Feds near-zero target for short-term rates to remain appropriate for a "considerable time" after the bond purchases end.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged from a week earlier at 0.6 point. The fee for a 15-year loan also remained at 0.6 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate was steady at 2.43 percent. The average fee rose to 0.5 point from 0.4 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage fell to 3.01 percent from 3.05 percent. The fee declined to 0.4 point from 0.5 point.	2014-05-15

Steady declines in applications show that very few companies are laying off workers.The Labor Department said Thursday that the less volatile four-week average declined 7,000 to 308,000, the lowest since June 2007.ADVERTISEMENTAll states reported their first-time applications on time, a department spokesman said. Applications plummeted three weeks ago because computer upgrades in California and Nevada prevented them from fully reporting their data. Those states have cleared their backlogs, the spokesman said.Applications are a proxy for layoffs. Fewer layoffs suggest employers are confident enough to maintain their staffing levels. But companies have been reluctant to take the next step and ramp up hiring.In fact, job gains have slowed in recent months. Employers have added an average of just 155,000 jobs a month since April. Thats down from an average of 205,000 for the first four months of the year.The unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent in August, from 7.4 percent in the previous month. But the drop mostly occurred because more Americans stopped working or looking for jobs. The government doesnt count people as unemployed unless they are actively searching for work.The economy may be growing too slowly to generate stronger hiring. It expanded at a 2.5 percent annual pace from April to June, the Commerce Department reported today. That is up from a meager 1.1 percent annual rate from January through March. For the first six months of the year, the economy has grown at a rate of just 1.8 percent.Economists worry that growth is slowing to an annual rate of 2 percent or less in the current July-September quarter. If correct, that would mark the third quarter in the last four that the annual growth rate has fallen to 2 percent or below, an abnormally low level of economic growth.About 3.9 million Americans received unemployment aid in the week ended Sept. 7, about 23,000 more than the previous week. That total has fallen 32 percent in the past year. Some recipients likely found jobs, but many have simply used up all the unemployment benefits available to them.	2013-09-26

562	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/06/10/american-auto-industry-about-to-go-on-hiring-spree/	American auto industry about to go on hiring spree	May 8, 2013: Jeff Caldwell, 29, right, a chassis assembly line supervisor, checks a vehicle on the assembly line at the Chrysler Jefferson North Assembly plant in Detroit.apThe auto industry is about to go on a hiring spree as car makers and parts suppliers race to find engineers, technicians and factory workers to build the next generation of vehicles.The new employees will be part of a larger, busier workforce. From coast to coast, the industry is in top gear. Factories are operating at about 95 percent of capacity, and many are already running three shifts. As a result, some auto and parts companies are doing something theyve been reluctant to consider since the recession: Adding floor space and spending millions of dollars on new equipment.ADVERTISEMENT"Were really bumping up against the edge," says Michael Robinet, managing director of IHS Automotive, which forecasts auto production. "So it really is brick-and-mortar time."The auto industrys stepped-up hiring will help sustain the nations job growth and help fuel consumer spending. On Friday, the government said U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs in May, roughly the monthly average for the past year and a sign of the economys resilience.At 7.6 percent, U.S. unemployment remains well above the 5 percent to 6 percent typical of a healthy economy. Growth is still modest, in part because of higher taxes and government spending cuts that kicked in this year and weak overseas economies. But the housing market is strengthening, and U.S. consumer confidence has reached a five-year high.The auto industrys outlook is bright. Vehicle sales for 2013 could reach 15.5 million, the highest in six years. To meet that demand, automakers must find more people. Hundreds of companies that make parts for automakers have to hire, too, just to keep up."As volume goes up, we will really need to add heads," says Mel Stephens, a spokesman for Lear Corp., which makes automotive seats.From January through May, automakers and parts companies hired 8,000 workers, a relatively slow rate. But the pace is picking up. The Center for Automotive Research expects the industry to add 35,000 over the full year.The hiring plans are widespread. Chrysler Group LLC, Honda Motor Co., General Motors Co., Mercedes-Benz and Ford Motor Co. plan to add more than 13,000 people this year.Large parts companies such as Lear, BorgWarner Inc. and TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. are hiring at factories and research centers. Smaller suppliers are adding jobs as well.The auto business has helped keep the economy afloat while Americans wait for the rest of the business world to start hiring. Since 2009, 1 in every 4 manufacturing jobs added in the U.S. came in the auto industry, says Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation, a manufacturing trade group. The auto industry is just under 7 percent of U.S. manufacturing jobs.Car companies and parts makers created 167,500 jobs from the end of the recession in June 2009 through May. At the same time, U.S. auto sales rose from a low point of 10.4 million in 2009 to an annual rate of more than 15 million so far this year.Chryslers comeback gave Jeff Caldwell the confidence to leave a human resources consulting firm. Caldwell joined the company in February as an assembly line supervisor at a Jeep Grand Cherokee factory in Detroit. He supervises 100 workers who build the SUVs chassis."I knew Chrysler was moving in the right direction," says Caldwell, 29, who was born in Detroit and always had an interest in cars. "They kind of reinvented themselves, and I really wanted to get in while I could."Among the hiring planned for this year:— Chrysler will add more than 3,500 workers this year at factories in Indiana, Ohio and Michigan to make transmissions and to build Jeeps and Ram pickups.— Ford expects to hire 2,200 salaried workers in information technology, product development and manufacturing. Plus the company is hiring 1,400 factory workers and recalling another 2,000 laid-off employees, in Michigan and Missouri.— GM is hiring 4,000 engineers and computer professionals at four technical centers in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Texas to develop software and other innovations.— Honda is adding at least 500 jobs this year at factories in Ohio, Indiana and Alabama as it moves more production to North America.— At TRW Automotive, recruiters are looking for 50 engineers in the Detroit area to work on new safety features such as a system that warns drivers when large animals are in their path.Smaller companies also are joining in. Automotive business at Waukesha Metal Products in Sussex, Wis., is so strong that the company is near its capacity to make metal parts for axles, drive shafts and interiors. Its adding $1 million worth of equipment near Milwaukee and building a plant in Mexico to be closer to companies it supplies.Most industry analysts predict that U.S. auto sales will rise gradually during the next five years. Estimates for this year range from 15 million to 15.5 million, compared with 14.5 million a year ago. LMC Automotive, a Troy, Mich., forecasting firm, predicts that sales will gradually increase to 17 million in 2017. That level would be almost equal to the boom years of the late 1990s and early 2000s.Analysts say sales will climb as more people reach driving age. Also, many consumers and businesses still have cars and trucks they bought last decade, if not earlier. The average vehicle on U.S. roads is now a record 11.2 years.The improving economy also helps lift sales. As the housing and construction sectors have come back to life, pickup sales have risen faster than the rest of the market. That has meant a job for Curtis Enkey of suburban Kansas City.Enkey was laid off in April of last year when Ford moved production of the Escape SUV from his factory near Kansas City to Louisville, Ky. He wasnt supposed to come back until Ford started making a commercial van at his plant in July or August. But higher sales of the F-150 pickup, which also is made at his factory, brought an early call to return.Now Enkey is happily working 50-hour weeks. A Ford worker since 1995, he makes about $29 per hour plus benefits.Even with the added hiring, the auto industry isnt the job creator it once was. In 2005, before huge cuts began, more than 1.1 million people made motor vehicles and parts. Today, 798,000 do, according to the latest government statistics.For engineers and many white-collar jobs, auto companies pay salaries that are competitive with the rest of the country. But wages and benefits in the factories have declined.Most new hires will start around $16 per hour, a little over half the pay that longtime workers get. The lower wage was a concession made by the United Auto Workers union to cut costs as the companies ran into financial trouble six years ago. New hires receive health care but get 401K plans instead of pensions, and they dont get health care in retirement like longtime workers do. Still, their wages are better than most other factory workers, who make $13 to $14 per hour in the U.S.The industry would be adding even more workers if not for productivity gains made since the boom years, says Kristin Dziczek, head of the labor and industry group at the Center for Automotive Research.In 2004, the nation had 70 auto-assembly plants. Now there are only 55. But the industry will make 10.7 million vehicles in those plants this year, only 850,000 fewer than in 2004, according to Wards Automotive.Executives are being forced to rethink hard lines theyve drawn against adding space — and costs — since they closed factories during the economic downturn.For instance, General Motors is building a 500,000-square-foot addition to its plant in Wentzville, Mo., to handle expected sales of the next generation of midsize pickup trucks due out next year.But at Ford, executives want to keep costs down by squeezing as many cars and trucks as possible out of existing factory space, mostly by increasing line speeds and breaking up equipment bottlenecks."We are running a number of our plants pretty full," says Joe Hinrichs, the companys president of the Americas. "But we have more upside if we need it."The recent hiring binge is even causing worker shortages in some areas. Skilled workers such as engineers, machinists, software developers and welders are hard to find, especially in the Detroit area. Entry-level factory jobs, which start around $15 per hour, are filled quickly."Were having some pretty good success finding people," said Ken Kaiser, vice president of engineering for TRW Automotive. "But wed like to find more, faster."	2013-06-10

A leaked copy of a draft of the summary of the report appeared online Friday on a climate skeptics website. Governments will spend the next few months making comments about the draft."Weve seen a lot of impacts and theyve had consequences," Carnegie Institution climate scientist Chris Field, who heads the report, told The Associated Press on Saturday. "And we will see more in the future."Cities, where most of the world now lives, have the highest vulnerability, as do the globes poorest people."Throughout the 21st century, climate change impacts will slow down economic growth and poverty reduction, further erode food security and trigger new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger," the report says. "Climate change will exacerbate poverty in low- and lower-middle income countries and create new poverty pockets in upper-middle to high-income countries with increasing inequality."For people living in poverty, the report says, "climate-related hazards constitute an additional burden."The report says scientists have high confidence especially in what it calls certain "key risks":— People dying from warming- and sea rise-related flooding, especially in big cities.— Famine because of temperature and rain changes, especially for poorer nations.— Farmers going broke because of lack of water.— Infrastructure failures because of extreme weather.— Dangerous and deadly heat waves worsening.— Certain land and marine ecosystems failing."Human interface with the climate system is occurring and climate change poses risks for human and natural systems," the 29-page summary says.None of the harms talked about in the report is solely due to global warming nor is climate change even the No. 1 cause, the scientists say. But a warmer world, with bursts of heavy rain and prolonged drought, will worsen some of these existing effects, they say.For example, in disease, the report says until about 2050 "climate change will impact human health mainly by exacerbating health problems that already exist" and then it will lead to worse health compared to a future with no further warming.If emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and gas continue at current trajectories, "the combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year will compromise normal human activities including growing food or working outdoors," the report says.Scientists say the global economy may continue to grow, but once the global temperature hits about 3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than now, it could lead to worldwide economic losses between 0.2 and 2.0 percent of income.One of the more controversial sections of the report involves climate change and war."Climate change indirectly increases risks from violent conflict in the form of civil war, intergroup violence and violent protests by exacerbating well-established drivers of these conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks," the report says.Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasnt part of the international study team, told the AP that the reports summary confirms what researchers have known for a long time: "Climate change threatens our health, land, food and water security."The summary went through each continent detailing risks and possible ways that countries can adapt to them.For North America, the highest risks over the long term are from wildfires, heat waves and flooding. Water — too much and too little — and heat are the biggest risks for Europe, South America and Asia, with South America and Asia having to deal with drought-related food shortages. Africa gets those risks and more: starvation, pests and disease. Australia and New Zealand get the unique risk of losing their coral reef ecosystems, and small island nations have to be worried about being inundated by rising seas.Field said experts paint a dramatic contrast of possible futures, but because countries can lessen some of the harms through reduced fossil fuel emissions and systems to cope with other changes, he said he doesnt find working on the report depressing."The reason Im not depressed is because I see the difference between a world in which we dont do anything and a world in which we try hard to get our arms around the problem," he said.___Seth Borenstein be followed at http://twitter.com/borenbears___Online:The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: http://www.ipcc.ch/	2013-11-03

Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, releases weekly mortgage rates, on Thursday, Jan. 16, 2014.(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Average U.S. rates for fixed mortgages declined this week, edging closer to historically low levels.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average for the 30-year loan fell to 4.41 percent from 4.51 percent last week. The average for the 15-year loan eased to 3.45 percent from 3.56 percent.ADVERTISEMENTMortgage rates have risen about a full percentage point since hitting record lows a year ago. The increase was driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve would reduce its bond purchases. The Fed determined last month that the economy was strong enough to start trimming those purchases, which have kept long-term interest rates low.The rise in mortgage rates slowed home sales, which have fallen for three straight months. But overall, 2013 was the best year for housing since the financial crisis. Most economists expect home sales and prices to keep rising this year, but at a slower pace. They forecast sales and prices will likely rise around 5 percent, down from double-digit gains in 2013.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged at 0.7 point. The fee for a 15-year loan rose to 0.7 point from 0.6 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage remained at 2.56 percent. The fee was unchanged at 0.5 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage fell to 3.10 percent from 3.15 percent. The fee rose to 0.5 point from 0.4 point.	2014-01-16

The NFIBs Index of Small Business Optimism rose 2.6 points to 92.1 last month, erasing a drop of 1.3 during March. The index was compiled from the survey of 1,873 NFIB members.ADVERTISEMENTThe index has averaged 90.7 since the recession, reflecting concerns about the economy and the potential impact the health care law will have on small businesses when its fully implemented Jan. 1. So the April gain doesnt reflect a big rebound in owners sentiment.Many owners are pessimistic because their sales are weak. More owners said sales fell during the first quarter than those who reported sales gains.And many owners still expect business conditions in six months to be weaker than they are today — a sign that the pace of expansion and hiring at small businesses will remain slow. Four percent say this is a good time to expand, but thats unchanged from March.The NFIB reported last week that owners picked up their hiring pace slightly during April, the fifth straight gain. The number planning to add jobs rose 6 points, but that gain brought only to a break-even point.	2013-05-14

Thats the most since June.ADVERTISEMENTEven with the increase, the number of available jobs is still below the roughly 4 million that were advertised each month before the recession began in December 2007.And the job market remains very competitive. With nearly 12.3 million people unemployed in October, there were 3.3 unemployed people, on average, competing for each open job. In a healthy economy, that ratio is roughly 2 to 1.Companies kept creating jobs in November at a modest pace. Employers added 146,000 net jobs last month, the government said Friday in a separate report.	2012-12-11

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  U.S. home prices fell for the second straight month in December as brutally cold weather, tight supply and higher costs slowed sales.The Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index declined 0.1 percent from November to December, matching the previous months decline. The index is not adjusted for seasonal variations, so the dip partly reflects slower buying as winter weather set in.ADVERTISEMENTFor all of 2013, however, prices rose by a healthy 13.4 percent, mostly because of big gains earlier in the year. That was the largest gain in eight years.The Case-Shiller index covers roughly half of U.S. homes. The index measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The December figures are the latest available.	2014-02-25

Penney Co. plunged a day after the department-store chain reported massive losses and a nearly 30 percent drop in revenue in its fiscal fourth-quarter period.The results, which were much worse than Wall Street expected, cap off a full year of steep losses and sales drops since CEO Ron Johnson launched a turnaround plan that included getting rid of most the 600 or so discounts the chain used to offer each year in in favor of everyday low prices.ADVERTISEMENTPenney reported on Wednesday after the markets closed that it widened its quarterly loss to $552 million, or $2.51 per share. Revenue fell 24.8 percent to $12.98 billion.On Thursday, its shares fell 19 percent, or $3.98, to $17.18. Shares have dropped 60 percent since early last year.	2013-02-28

The judge said the U.S. Department of Agriculture followed proper procedure in issuing permits to Valley Meat Co. in Roswell, N.M., Rains Natural Meats of Gallatin, Mo., and Responsible Transportation in Sigourney, Iowa.ADVERTISEMENTThe appeals courts order Friday said the groups "failed to meet their burden for an injunction pending appeal."Blair Dunn, an attorney for Valley Meat and Rains Natural Meats, said the order lifts the emergency status of the case, meaning it will likely be months before a final decision is issued.Dunn said the plants are ready to open, although they could agree to remain shuttered if the plaintiffs agree to post a sufficient bond to cover the companies losses should they ultimately prevail."They are getting ready to go as quickly as they can. It shouldnt take too long. Not more than two weeks," he said.The Humane Society of the United States said, however, that "the fight for Americas horses is not over.""We will press for a quick resolution of the merits of our claims in the 10th Circuit," said Jonathan R. Lovvorn, the groups senior vice president of animal protection litigation and investigations.The plants would become the first horse slaughterhouses to operate in the U.S. since Congress effectively banned horse slaughter by eliminating funding for inspections at the plants. Congress restored that funding in 2011, but the USDA did not approve the first permits for horse slaughterhouses until this summer.The issue has divided horse rescue and animal welfare groups, ranchers, politicians and Indian tribes about what is the most humane way to deal with the countrys horse overpopulation, and what rescue groups have said are a rising number of neglected and starving horses as the West deals with persistent drought.The companies want to ship horse meat to countries where it is consumed by humans or used as animal feed.Valley Meat and Responsible Transportation were set to begin horse slaughter operations in August, but U.S. District Judge Christina Armijo blocked their plans while she heard the lawsuit by The Humane Society of the United States, Front Range Equine Rescue and others. The groups claimed the plants should have been forced to undergo environmental reviews under provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act.Responsible Transportation abandoned its horse slaughter plans and converted its plant to cattle before Armijo dismissed the lawsuit in November.Attorneys for the plants have argued that the plaintiffs are simply in court because they are morally opposed to horse slaughter and are looking for a way to delay the plants while they lobby Congress for a ban.Proponents of a return to domestic horse slaughter point to a 2011 report from the federal Government Accountability Office that shows horse abuse and abandonment have increased since domestic horse slaughter was banned. They say it is better to slaughter the animals in humane, federally regulated facilities than have them abandoned to starve across the drought-stricken West or shipped to inhumane facilities in Mexico.Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of The Humane Society of the United States, calls the practice barbaric and has said blocking a return to domestic horse slaughter "is an issue of national importance and scale."	2013-12-14

Ever since the financial crisis in 2008, many had worried that the next big disaster was waiting around the corner, ready to clobber them.But even the gloomiest money managers turned cheerful in January, when the Dow Jones industrial average got off to its best start to any year since 1994. The stock market has continued climbing, sometimes shakily, in the face of government budget cuts that threaten to hamper a sluggish economy. With the Dow reaching an all-time high of 14,253.77 on Tuesday, and up 9 percent already this year, it seems the pessimists have been chased into hiding.ADVERTISEMENTThe Associated Press asked two experts for their thoughts on the markets rapid rise. One is bullish, James Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. The other is a skeptic, Jeffrey Kleintop, the chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston.Here are excerpts from the interviews, edited for length and clarity:AP: What do you make of how well the market has done this year? The economy is still plodding along. Are you concerned that the market has climbed too high, too fast?PAULSEN: We havent seen these spectacular one-day gains of 3 percent this year. Were just methodically marching ahead. I think thats a good sign.Ive been bullish for a while. If anything, I think stocks have been underpriced for some time. During this recovery, weve been plagued by the idea that the world was going to end, whether its Greece, the U.S. debt limit, whatever. Thats been the story: Armageddon is coming every year. So the market was lower than it should have been.Today, there are more things working than before. The labor force is growing, banks are making loans, home prices are rising. China is picking up again. Europe is calm. So many things are getting better, and thats driving people to equities.KLEINTOP: Its an interesting year, for sure. A lot of dangers are off the table, and thats allowed valuations to rise. We have plenty of other risks, though. The economy is growing at a very slow pace. Wages are low. When people have little income, theres not much to drive economic growth higher or drive revenue for companies.Our view at the start of the year was that well still see low to modest single-digit returns for the market in 2013. Thats still our view. In other words, it wouldnt be a surprise to see the stock market end the year exactly where it was in late January.Thats similar to the pattern over the past few years. We charge up to these milestones then retreat. In 2011, the Dow broke above 12,000 in February but didnt remain above it until that December. Last year, the Dow reached 13,000 in February but couldnt remain above it until December.AP: Corporate profits appear to be growing at a much slower pace. How does that play into your outlook?PAULSEN: Corporate profits are 15 percent plus higher today than in 2006. Sure, earnings are growing slower but so what? The key is the valuation, what people are willing to pay for those earnings. And valuations are starting to rise because people are getting more confident.Weve already produced the great bulk of earnings that were going to get in the cycle. But we can still break through (the Standard & Poors 500 record of) 1,565, and touch 1,700 with very modest earnings growth. I think were going to have 15 to 20 percent total returns in 2013, with dividends, in that ballpark.KLEINTOP: I think earnings expectations have to come down a lot, especially for the second half of the year. The current expectation is for 10 percent earnings growth in the third quarter and 13 percent in the fourth. I think theyre a bit too high. Maybe well see about half of that. Its hard to get (people to pay more for every dollar of earnings) if earnings estimates keep getting cut.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 14.8 right now. Im not a bear, but its hard to see how it can break above that level if earnings estimates are coming down.	2013-03-05

Just another day as Dows all-time high doesnt impress Wall Street workers	NEW YORK –  What record?There were no signs of a celebration on Wall Street after the Dow Jones industrial average closed at an all-time high Tuesday. Like on any other day, traders rushed out the doors of the New York Stock Exchange after the closing bell and down the stairs of subway stations. Nearby office workers did the same.ADVERTISEMENTMaybe the memories of the financial meltdown are too fresh, or outlook for the economy is too uncertain. But the only indication that something historic had transpired was the six television news cameras that faced the stock exchange. Even that perplexed some Wall Street denizens."Is that what this is about?" said one trader, referring to the cameras and reporters as he darted across Wall Street. He said he didnt have time to give his name because he was rushing to get home.The Dow rose 125.95 points Tuesday and closed at 14,253.77, topping the previous record set on Oct. 9, 2007 by almost 90 points. The blue-chip index has more than doubled since falling to a low of 6,547 in March 2009 during the financial crisis. Its another sign that the country is slowly healing after the worst recession since the 1930s.Stocks have been rising thanks to stimulus from the Federal Reserve and record corporate profits. But the economic recovery has been slow and unemployment has remained high. And theres no telling where the stock market will go next.Its no wonder that the reaction on Wall Street has been less than enthusiastic."It was relatively subdued," said Ted Weisberg, a trader who was on the stock exchange floor when the final bell rang Tuesday."When you experience a meltdown like we did, it leaves deep financial scars," said Weisberg, who has worked at the New York Stock Exchange for 44 years. "If youve been burned, youre not going to embrace the enthusiasm.""Theres also less people to get excited," he added. The rise of electronic trading means that fewer people are needed on the trading floor.Markets in Asia did celebrate on Wall Streets coattails Wednesday, led by a jump in Japans Nikkei 225 index of over 1 percent.Popular after-work hangouts were half empty Tuesday night. Stone Street, a cobble stone road thats a five minute walk from Wall Street and home to several bars and restaurants, was quiet."Its a little busy, but mostly the same as usual," said Gina Parascandola, an event planner at Ulysses Folk House, a Stone Street pub where workers come in to grab a drink and a bite to eat.Weisberg had no plans to celebrate the Dows record either."Im doing what I always do; go back to work," Weisberg said outside the stock exchange after the market closed. "Its just another day."	2013-03-06

Thats near the 3.31 percent rate reached in November, the lowest on records dating to 1971.ADVERTISEMENTThe average rate on the 15-year fixed mortgage slipped to 2.76 percent from 2.77 last week. The record low is 2.63 percent.The lowest mortgage rates in decades have helped the housing market recover. More people are buying homes, which has pushed up home prices. And ultra-low rates have encouraged more people to refinance. That often lowers monthly mortgage payments and leaves consumers with more spending money.A measure of the number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes rose in January from December to the highest level in more than 2 1/2 years, the National Association of Realtors reported Wednesday. The increase suggests that sales of previously occupied homes will continue rising in the coming months.New-home sales jumped 16 percent last month from December to the highest level since July 2008, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Home prices, meanwhile, rose by the most in more than six years in the 12 months ending in December.Still, some people are unable to take advantage of the low mortgage rates, either because they cant qualify for stricter lending rules or they lack the money for larger down payment requirements.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country on Monday through Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for 30-year mortgages was unchanged at 0.8 point. The fee for 15-year loans also remained at 0.8 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage ticked down to 2.64 percent from 2.65 percent last week. The fee for one-year adjustable-rate loans was steady at 0.4 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage fell to 2.61 percent from 2.64.

With the third-largest oil and gas reserves in the world, after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, Canada wants to double its oil production in the next 10 years. While it has plenty of oil to tap, there arent enough skilled workers to help secure it.ADVERTISEMENT- Mike Riordan, Minnesota ironworker who went north for workThats especially true in the western province of Alberta, where mining the oil sands and creating the infrastructure for it is providing plenty of work.Ironworker Mike Riordan left  Minnesota for Albertas capitol city of Edmonton - which serves as a staging ground for many of the big oil companies. Riordan says work was slow for him in the U.S. and hes now making twice what he was back home."The opportunities are just basically endless up here right now," said Riordan. "Theres obviously a shortage of workers. You could go anywhere and make some pretty good money."Ken Hughes, Albertas minister of energy, said his province will need more than 100,000 workers in the next decade. Hughes added that moving to Canada can be an easy transition for Americans."Our cultures are similar, our standards are very similar, we have a lot of opportunity for people who want to work hard, who want to make some money, who want to continue to live in a society that is very similar to their own society,"  said Hughes in a recent interview with Fox News in Edmonton.Construction company PCL is looking for iron workers, pipefitters and welders to name a few vocations."They can make some pretty good money. The average rate is about $40 an hour for a pipefitter here, so if you extrapolate that over a year, its a 100-thousand or more, pretty darn good money," said Gary Trigg, vice president of fabrication with PCL." I think Id be on the next plane or a bus or be hitchhiking or someway to get up here,  if youve got the skills."And skills you need, as these arent entry level positions."There is a severe demand for skilled workers, not entry level. Those skilled workers who have trade qualifications and probably have five to 10 or more years of experience, " said Abigail Fulton, vice president of the British Columbia Construction Association.  The organization represents some 2000 employers in industrial, commercial and institutional contractors. The province of British Columbia needs some 40,000 workers. Qualified Canadians are getting the jobs, there just arent enough of them."The more skilled workers we can put in place, the more journey persons we have on the site, the more entry level Canadians we can take on and provide apprenticeships and so forth,"  said  Fulton at a recent job fair her organization hosted with Riverside County near Palm Springs, California.Both the British Columbia Construction Association and the Edmonton Economic Development plan to hold more job fairs in the U.S. in the new year.

Orders in a category considered a proxy for business investment plans rose 0.9 percent, a modest gain but an improvement from a preliminary report last week that had shown a decline.ADVERTISEMENTWeaker economies overseas and the impact of across-the-board government spending cuts have made businesses more cautious, dampening demand for manufactured goods.

Thats up from a preliminary reading of 71.3, released on Jan. 18. And its slightly better than Decembers reading of 72.9.ADVERTISEMENTThe preliminary survey reflected consumers initial reaction to an increase in Social Security taxes, which took effect in early January. A separate survey from the Conference Board also showed consumer confidence fell in January because of the tax increase.On Friday, the government said the economy added 157,000 jobs in January and hiring was stronger at the end of 2012 than previously thought.The final Michigan survey, which included data collected after Jan. 18, showed consumers were more optimistic about their prospects for the next six months than they were in December. Still, their mood about current conditions declined from December.Richard Curtin, chief economist for the survey, said the tax increase was the main reason consumers, particularly those from lower-income households, felt less confident about current conditions.Social Security taxes rose after a 2 percent cut, in place for two years, expired Jan. 1. That means a person earning $50,000 a year will have about $1,000 less to spend in 2013. A household with two high-paid workers will have up to $4,500 less.Economists said they were looking for modest improvements in consumer confidence in coming months as long as job growth keeps improving."After getting slammed in December, consumer confidence is starting to stabilize," said Chris G. Christopher, senior economist at Global Insight.	2013-02-01

Thats about a 2 percent increase over the average hourly wage that workers in Smyrna and Canton make now. Production and maintenance workers make $2 an hour less, on average, in Canton than in Smyrna.The pay raises come as the United Auto Workers try to unionize workers at the Canton and Smyrna plants. The UAW has appealed to Mississippi workers in part by noting the pay gap between Mississippi and Tennessee plants. So far, the union has not filed for an election at either plant. Nissan has said it pays less in Mississippi because wages in general are lower in the state.Its the first raise for Nissans American workers since 2006. The company says auto sales are improving and the economy is strengthening."Obviously, that means more stability and security for all of our employees and an even bigger economic impact on the state of Mississippi," Dan Bednarzyk, the head of Nissans Mississippi operations, told members of the Mississippi Economic Council during a Thursday meeting.Nissan and its contractors employ 5,200 workers in Canton, more than 6,000 in Smyrna and more than 1,400 in Decherd. Those totals include a number of contract employees who dont work directly for Nissan. The company has ramped up hiring in the past two years, as auto sales increase, Nissan tries to shift production from Japan to the United States, and the company tries to capture 10 percent of the U.S. market.

The October reading was higher than initially reported, but still well below the 80.2 reading in September.ADVERTISEMENTConfidence plunged in October on worries about the shutdown. The November decline, however, was mostly due to concerns about the next six months.Less optimism among Americans could slow the holiday shopping season and weigh on economic growth. Consumer spending drives 70 percent of economic activity.But spending patterns dont always closely follow measures of confidence. Americans sometimes shop more even when they say they are less optimistic.Thats what happened last month. Despite a sharp fall in confidence in October, consumers spent 0.4 percent more at retail stores and restaurants than in September.Strong auto sales accounted for about half the gain. Restaurants also reported a healthy increase in spending. Americans also spent more on furniture, electronics and clothing. There were some signs of caution: sales at grocery stores were flat and department stores reported only slightly higher sales.Lower gas prices and a recent pickup in job gains could help maintain Americans ability to spend, even as their confidence wanes.Employers added an average of 202,000 jobs from August through October, up from just 146,000 in the previous three months.And lower gas prices have put more money in consumers pockets. Prices fell for nine straight weeks to the lowest level in nearly two years before moving up slightly in the past two week. The average price for a gallon of gas nationwide Monday was $3.28.Economic growth is expected to slow in the current October-December quarter, partly because consumer spending growth is likely to be moderate. The economy expanded at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, but most economists expect it will slow to about a 2 percent rate or lower in the fourth quarter.	2013-11-26

The rate fell because more people stopped looking for work.More than 300,000 people stopped working or looking for a job. Their exodus shrank the so-called labor force participation rate — the percentage of adult Americans with a job or seeking one — to 63.2 percent. Its the lowest participation rate since August 1978.ADVERTISEMENTOnce people without a job stop looking for one, the government no longer counts them as unemployed. Thats why the unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent in August from 7.4 percent in July even though 115,000 fewer people said they had jobs.If those who left the labor force last month had still been looking for work, the unemployment rate would have risen to 7.5 percent in August."Pretty disappointing," said Beth Ann Bovino, senior economist at Standard & Poors. "You saw more people leave the job market and fewer people get jobs. Not a good sign."Back in 2000, the participation rate hit a high of 67.3 percent. At the time, women were pouring into the labor force. But womens participation fell modestly through the mid-2000s — then dropped sharply from late 2009 through 2013.Womens participation rate is now 57 percent. The rate for men is nearly 70 percent.Another factor in the declining participation is that the oldest baby boomers have reached retirement age.But Craig Alexander, chief economist at TD Bank Group, says "demographics cannot explain the amount of decline" in labor force participation.Many Americans without jobs remain so discouraged that theyve given up on the job market. Others have retired early. Younger ones have enrolled in school.Some Americans have suspended their job hunt until the employment landscape brightens. A rising number are collecting disability checks."Its not necessarily people retiring," Bovino says. "Its young people going back to school" rather than taking their chances on a weak job market.Labor force participation for Americans ages 16 to 19 was just 34 percent last month. Thats near their record low of 33.5 percent set last year.It isnt supposed to be this way. After a recession, a brightening economy is supposed to draw people back into the job market. But it hasnt happened. Labor force participation "certainly shouldnt be at current levels," Alexander says.There arent enough jobs being filled. Employers are hiring about 4.3 million people a month — before layoffs, dismissals and resignations. In 2007, before the Great Recession, they were hiring 5.2 million a month.There are three unemployed people, on average, competing for each job opening, compared with 1.8 when the recession began in December 2007.	2013-09-06

The Feds purchases of about $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bonds are intended to lower long-term interest rates and encourage more borrowing and spending.ADVERTISEMENTThe minutes of the Feds March 19-20 meeting were released at 9 a.m. EDT — five hours earlier than planned — after the Fed inadvertently sent them a day earlier to congressional staffers and lobbyists."One gets the sense that many Fed policymakers are anxious to start paring back the size of the ... purchases as soon as the data allow," Dana Saporta, an economist at Credit Suisse, said in a note to clients.Still, a weak employment report released Friday is likely to make policymakers even more supportive of keeping the measures in place for the foreseeable future.The report showed employers added just 88,000 net jobs last month. That was the fewest in nine months and much lower than the average of 220,000 jobs a month created from November through February.The unemployment rate dropped to a four-year low of 7.6 percent last month. However, the rate fell only because more people stopped looking for work and were no longer counted as unemployed.In its statement after the last meeting, the Fed said the economy had strengthened but still needed its efforts to help lower high unemployment. In addition to continuing the bond purchases, the Fed stuck by its plan to keep short-term interest rates at record lows at least until unemployment falls to 6.5 percent.The minutes indicated that many of the Feds members want to see sustained improvement in the job market — from a wide range of economic indicators — before making any decision to reduce the pace of purchases.Stocks rose sharply after the minutes were released. The Standard & Poors 500 index rose 16 points to 1,585 in midday trading — above its all-time high of 1,576.09 set in October 2007. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 119 points to 14,792.The Fed made minutes public earlier on Wednesday after learning that about 100 congressional staffers and lobbyists received them at 2 p.m. EDT on Tuesday. They had been scheduled to be released at 2 p.m. EDT on Wednesday.Fed spokesman David Skidmore said the Fed notified the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about the mishap. The Fed also asked its inspector general to investigate its procedures for releasing the minutes."At this time we do not know if there was any trading related to the early distribution," Skidmore said. "Every indication at this time is that the early distribution of the minutes was entirely accidental."John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, declined to comment on the release of the minutes, beyond saying that the Fed contacted the SEC staff.Several staff members of both the House Financial Services and Senate Banking committees were among those who received the minutes early.The minutes showed a wide array of opinions and criteria for when to end the bond purchases, which have boosted the Feds balance sheet to $3.2 trillion.A few members want to end "relatively soon" the bond-purchase program. Those members say the costs likely outweigh the benefits. A few others saw the risks as increasing quickly and said the purchases would likely need to be reduced "before long."Many members said an improved job market could lead them to slow purchases within a few months, and a few said economic conditions would likely justify continuing the program until late this year.___AP Business Writer Marcy Gordon contributed to this report.	2013-04-10

But they cut back sharply on credit card use, continuing a trend that could hold back growth this year.Consumer borrowing rose $14.6 billion in December from November to a total of $2.78 trillion, the Federal Reserve said Thursday. Thats the highest level on record.ADVERTISEMENTThe increase was driven entirely by gains in student and auto loans. Borrowing in the category that measures those loans increased $18.2 billion, the biggest monthly gain since November 2001.But credit card debt fell $3.6 billion. Americans have been relying less on credit cards since the Great Recession. Total credit card debt has fallen roughly 17 percent since the July 2008.The December decline could also be a signal that consumers were worried in December about tax increases that kicked in last month and are reducing take-home pay.While credit card debt has fallen since the recession, student loan debt has surged. It has risen 63 percent since mid-2008 to total $956 billion as of September of 2012, according to quarterly data compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The increase partly reflects high unemployment, which has led many Americans to seek better education and skills in a more competitive labor market.Auto loan debt is slightly lower than its level in mid-2008. But it has risen roughly 9.4 percent since mid-2010 to total $750 billion as of September, according to the New York Fed report. U.S. automakers are coming off their best year for sales in five years, helped by extremely low interest rates that have encouraged more borrowing.Analysts say credit card debt to stay weak this year, which could slow consumer spending and hold back economic growth.Congress and the White House reached an agreement last month to prevent income taxes from rising on most Americans. But the deal did not extend a temporary cut in Social Security taxes, which expired on Jan. 1. The two percentage point increase means a person earning $50,000 a year will have about $1,000 less to spend in 2013. A household with two high-paid workers will have up to $4,500 less.Most economists expect the tax increase could trim the economys growth by about one-half a percentage point this year.Consumers spent more in December, according to a government report last week, though the increase was slower than in November. Consumer spending drives about 70 percent of the economy.The overall economy actually shrank in the October-December, dipping at an annual rate of 0.1 percent, the first quarterly decline since the recession was ending in the summer of 2009.The Federal Reserves borrowing report covers auto loans, student loans and credit cards. It excludes mortgages, home equity loans and other loans tied to real estate.	2013-02-07

Crowes line drive to left field off Brian Duensing (6-2) allowed the speedy Villar to score easily, giving Houston its first win in six tries against Minnesota.Manager Bo Porter took Villar out of Tuesday nights game after he was thrown out trying to stretch a leadoff single into a double in the third inning. Porter spoke to him afterward about the importance of being smart on the bases.They had a much more positive talk after Wednesdays game."I went over and I gave him a hug and told him, Im very proud of you," Porter said. "Thats maturity ... a lot of guys would hang their head and say, Poor old me, I got taken out of the game. He didnt handle it that way at all.""I really felt like he was going to handle it the right way and he came out today and literally showed that he handled it the right way," Porter continued.Villar understood why he got in trouble, but doesnt plan on stifling his aggression on the bases."I told him I was going to keep playing my game," said Villar, whose comments were translated by a reporter who spoke Spanish. "Despite what happened yesterday, he likes for me to play aggressively. He likes me to play aggressively, so thats how Ill play. Thats how Ill always play because thats my style of play."Duensing was unhappy that he wasnt able to hold off the Astros."I just didnt execute right there at the end, and they did what they were supposed to," he said.Ryan Doumits leadoff home run in the ninth against Astros reliever Erik Bedard (4-10) tied it at 5."We had chances, but there at the end, they just got it done," Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said. "They got the big hit, and (Duensing) just didnt make a good pitch there."Crowe, who also drove in a run in the fourth, has seven hits in four games since returning from Triple-A."Its definitely a good start," he said. "I owe a lot of credit to Bo, I was in a good rhythm and he put me right in the lineup and I feel like Im still in that rhythm."Minnesota was down 3-0 after a three-run first inning by the Astros before tying it on a three-run shot by Alex Presley in the third. It was Presleys first homer since being acquired from Pittsburgh in the trade for Justin Morneau.Pedro Florimon doubled to open the eighth and scored on a groundout by Darin Mastroianni as the Twins closed to 5-4.Before tying it, Minnesota squandered a chance in the seventh when Chris Herrmann grounded into an inning-ending double play with the bases loaded.Brandon Barnes had two RBIs and Chris Carter and Brett Wallace added two hits apiece for Houston.Minnesota starter Liam Hendriks yielded eight hits and five runs in 4 1-3 innings, leaving him with just one win in six starts this season.Houston starter Jordan Lyles allowed four hits and three runs in 6 1-3 innings.An RBI double by Wallace put Houston up 1-0 in the first inning. Carter walked before Wallace barely scored on a single by Marc Krauss and make it 2-0, and Barnes added a sacrifice fly.Presley came out on top of a 13-pitch at-bat in the third, coming back from an 0-2 count before hitting a tying home run to right field.Jose Altuve doubled with two outs in the fourth and scored on Crowes single for a 4-3 lead.Carter led off the fifth with a single, then the 6-foot-4, 245-pound slugger took second on his second steal this season. Barnes single off reliever Ryan Pressly pushed Houstons lead to 5-3.NOTES: Krauss was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City on Wednesday and was Houstons designated hitter. ...

Meanwhile, more homeowners are keeping up with their mortgage payments.Thats led to fewer homes entering the foreclosure pipeline on a national level.In some states, however, there is a backlog of homes with mortgages gone unpaid. Typically these are states like New York and Florida, where the courts play a role in the foreclosure process. In other states, like California and Nevada, laws aimed at stalling foreclosures have extended the time it takes for the process to play out.As a result, some of those homes with mortgages gone unpaid are only now entering the foreclosure process or being scheduled for auction."Were going to have this year some states that are still seeing the last surges in foreclosure activity because of continued delays in the process," said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac. "Not even an improving economy may help a lot of these."Last month, 22 states posted annual increases in homes that got started on the path to foreclosure. Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey and California had the biggest increases. In California, foreclosure starts rose on an annual basis for the first time in more than a year.All told, banks initiated foreclosure actions against 57,259 U.S. homes last month, a 10 percent jump from December, RealtyTrac said. Foreclosure starts typically pick up in January after slowing in December. They were down 12 percent from a year ago.Many of these homes are likely to begin making their way through the foreclosure process this year, Blomquist said.That said, Blomquist said he expects that completed foreclosures will decline nationally this year from 2013, when they totaled 462,970.Foreclosures peaked in 2010 at 1.05 million and have been declining ever since.	2014-02-13

That is a record level and follows a September increase of $16.3 billion.ADVERTISEMENTThe increase was led by a $13.9 billion rise in borrowing for auto loans and student loans. But borrowing in the category that covers credit cards rose by $4.3 billion following a decline of $218 million in September. It was the biggest monthly credit card gain since May and could be a sign that consumer spending will increase in coming months. Credit card borrowing has lagged other types of debt.Through October, the measure of auto loans and student loans has risen 6.2 percent from a year ago and has increased in every month but one since May 2010. But credit card debt is up just 1 percent from where it was a year ago. And it is 16.1 percent below its peak hit in July 2008 — seven months after the Great Recession began.Slow job growth and small wage gains have made many Americans more reluctant to charge goods and services.But at the same time, the weak economy is persuading more people to go back to school to learn new skills. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York quarterly report on consumer credit shows student loan debt has been the biggest driver of borrowing since the Great Recession officially ended in June 2009.Analysts are hoping that consumers will step up spending and help drive faster economic growth. The overall economy grew at an annual rate of 3.6 percent in the July-September period, according to a revised estimate released Thursday, up from growth of 2.5 percent in the April-June period.However, about half of the third-quarter growth came from a huge increase in the buildup of business stockpiles. That is not is expected to last and slower inventory building is likely to contribute to weaker economic growth of less than 2 percent in the current October-December quarter.The Feds borrowing report tracks credit card debt, auto loans and student loans but not mortgages, home equity loans and other loans.	2013-12-06

The average for the 15-year mortgage fell to 3.32 percent from 3.39 percent.ADVERTISEMENTA report released Tuesday by real estate data provider CoreLogic showed that U.S. home prices rose 0.9 percent in January after three months of declines, as a tight supply of properties likely supported prices despite slower sales.Economists say such outsize price gains might not continue much longer, however.The harsh winter weather of recent weeks appears to have kept the economy in check. Sales of existing homes plunged in January to the slowest pace in 18 months, hit by the weather, higher interest rates and rising home prices. Signed contracts to buy existing homes have stayed flat for February and January, a sign that the weak sales could persist through March and April.Mortgage rates tend to follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The 10-year note traded at 2.71 percent Wednesday, up from 2.67 percent a week earlier.Mortgage rates have risen about a full percentage point since hitting record lows roughly a year ago. The increase was driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve would reduce its $85 billion-a-month bond purchases, which have helped keep long-term interest rates low. Deeming the economy to be gaining strength, the Fed announced in December and January that it was reducing its monthly bond purchases.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged at 0.7 point. The fee for a 15-year loan declined to 0.6 point from 0.7 point last week.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage was unchanged at 2.52 percent. The average fee slipped to 0.3 point from 0.4 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage fell to 3.03 percent from 3.05 percent. The fee declined to 0.4 point from 0.5 point.	2014-03-06

"A lot of people dont have the assets or the savings to repair their house."More than 7,200 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in Larimer and Boulder counties, the hardest-hit areas of Colorado, according to county officials. But fewer than 6,000 home and business owners in those two counties had flood insurance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.It wasnt known how many of the insured homes and businesses suffered flood damage. Boulder and Larimer counties have a total of 606,000 residents and 261,000 housing units.Statewide, only about 22,000 homeowners have flood insurance policies, FEMA spokesman Jerry DeFelice said. With 2.2 million housing units in Colorado, according to Census figures, that means about 1 percent of the states residences have flood coverage.Some people dont realize that standard homeowners insurance doesnt cover floods. Others gamble that they wont need flood insurance and decide not to pay for it. In Colorado, adding flood coverage to a homeowners policy costs an average of about $650 a year."I think theres the all-too-human impulse to think it wont happen to you," DeFelice said. "I think were like that."State officials have released no estimates of the costs of the floods, which killed at least six people and left two others missing and presumed dead. But the damage is expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.Klauzer-Zimmerman is still waiting to hear whether her homeowners insurance includes sewage backups. Even if it does, the coverage is limited to $10,000. She knows shell need a lot more than that."Ive got three kids sleeping on a couch, but were safe," she said.Josh Landwehr of Boulder said he is in the insurance business but has no flood policy because his home is just outside a flood plain.Water and sewage got into his basement. But Landwehr said flood insurance wouldnt have helped because it "only covers water that comes through the front door," not up from the ground.Deyn Johnson, owner of Whispering Pines Cottages in the tourist town of Estes Park, has flood insurance but couldnt afford a policy that would cover all of her losses.Only three of her 11 cottages are usable, her water well and septic system were damaged, and floodwaters carved a 7-foot ravine into the property."Flood insurance does not cover any loss of income whatsoever," Johnson said. She doubts it will cover debris removal, let alone rebuilding the cabins or restoring utilities."Flood" has become the new F-word in Johnsons vocabulary."It seems anytime that F-word comes up, they say, We dont have to do anything for you," she said.Homeowners arent required to get flood insurance unless they have a federally backed mortgage and live in a 100-year flood plain — defined as an area that could be inundated by a flood so large there is only a 1 percent chance of it occurring in any given year, DeFelice said.Individual lenders also can require the insurance if theyre worried about flood risk in other areas.All homeowners should at least consider getting flood insurance, no matter where they live, DeFelice said. And he warned that a 100-year-flood plain is more of a concept than a definable geographic area."Mother Nature isnt going to observe that line," he said.DeFelice predicts more Coloradans will sign up for flood insurance, but others experience suggests they might not keep the policies.The 1997 Red River flood in North Dakota and Minnesota caused nearly $2 billion in damage just in Grand Forks, N.D., but fewer than 750 Grand Forks homeowners had flood coverage a decade later.Weedin said his insurance agency is getting five or six calls a day from people asking about flood insurance, up from two or three a month before last weeks catastrophe."At this point, its mostly people who are scared, not people who have had the loss," he said.___Associated Press writers Jeri Clausing and Ivan Moreno contributed to this report.___Follow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP.

"At this point, well try anything."Vaughn said he was approved by the city commission to have his entire take-home pay exchanged from the U.S. dollar to Bitcoins. His salary is believed to be the first instance of a government worker being paid in the Internet currency.- Tony Vaughn, the police chiefHe made the request at a meeting held last month. Claude Branson, a city commissioner, said the board researched Bitcoins and "if that’s the way he wants to be paid and that’s the way the city is going to pay him," the Hazard-Herald reported.To be clear, Vaughn will be taxed in U.S. dollars before his paycheck is converted to Bitcoins and transferred to the city’s account. The first transaction will likely be executed by the end of the week.Bitcoins are created, distributed and authenticated independently of any bank or government.Their relative anonymity holds out the promise of being able to spend money across the Internet without scrutiny. Despite wild swings in value, the virtual currency has been moving toward broader acceptance. A growing number of companies accept Bitcoins, which can be converted into cash. At the end of November, Bitcoins were valued at $1,000 per coin.Mayor Johnny Cummings said his salary will continue to be paid in U.S. dollars, but he will convert the money and donate it to the towns account. He said he had to recently cut employees hours at his office in order to prevent layoffs."My job is to protect the people here," he said.Vicco made national headlines when commissioners voted in January to pass an ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations.Vaughn, who owns real estate and does not need to work, said he was called to law enforcement because of his desire to give back. He said he’s seen firsthand, how mine closures affect an entire community."Suddenly tire companies arent selling tires for trucks, gas stations are hurting, smaller businesses," he said.

An annual survey released by the Annie E. Casey Foundation shows the number of children living in poverty increased to 23 percent in 2011. The survey ranks New Mexico as the worst in the nation when it comes to child well-being.APALBUQUERQUE, N.M. –  It wasnt so long ago that David Hutchinson spent a month sleeping under a bridge while his wife and young daughter spent their nights at a domestic violence shelter.But this wasnt a case of domestic violence. The couple simply had no choice. There were just no shelters in Phoenix with room for another homeless family, and their top priority was finding a safe place for their daughter.ADVERTISEMENTThe family is one of many in the U.S. that have been trying to raise children in the face of joblessness and homelessness. An annual survey released Monday by the Annie E. Casey Foundation shows the number of children living in poverty increased to 23 percent in 2011, after the recession.The Southwest has been hit particularly hard. New Mexico, for the first time, has slipped to worst in the nation when it comes to child well-being. More than 30 percent of children in the state were living in poverty in 2011 and nearly two-fifths had parents who lacked secure employment, according to this years Kids Count survey.Nevada is ranked No. 48, followed by Arizona. Mississippi, which has traditionally held last place, made slight improvements in early childhood education while reading and math proficiency for some students increased, putting the state at No. 49.Overall, the report shows there have been gains in education and health nationally, but since 2005, there have been serious setbacks when it comes to the economic well-being of children."Theres little doubt that things are getting worse," said Kim Posich, executive director of the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty. "Aside from the fact the New Mexico economy has been so slow to turn around, the systems that generally serve people who are the working poor and suddenly lose their jobs or face greater hardship, all those systems have been strained beyond the max."In Arizona, charities and government programs were cut during the recession, making it more difficult for families to get by and rebuild, said Dana Wolfe Naimark of the Childrens Action Alliance in Phoenix."So many things were slashed just when people needed it the most," she said. "That is a key policy issue that we do have choices over. We can find ways to rebuild that investment. Its not OK to just throw up our hands and say, We cant."According to the Kids Count report, a lingering concern is the effect of unemployment on children, particularly long-term unemployment. Researchers found that more than 4 million workers were unemployed for more than six months, and more than 3 million were without work for a year or more.David Hutchinson and his family eventually ended up in Albuquerque. He has been looking for work for months. Finally, he landed a job just this week with a contractor who installs fire suppression systems."If I wasnt so crippled, Id be doing backflips," he said, pointing to the rod and pins in his forearm, an injury that ended his career in the U.S. Navy.His wife, Chelsea, said she knows her husband is ready to put aside any pain because the prospect of their family being able to move from Joy Junction, the shelter where they have been staying since December, hinges on a regular income.William and Elimar Roper are in the same boat. They and their four children have been at the shelter for about a year. William just landed a job in the kitchen and Elimar has graduated from the shelters recovery program, which helps those addicted to drugs or alcohol."Were happy because weve upgraded from being homeless to something that can help us stabilize. Its the first step," Elimar Roper said.William Roper served in the U.S. Army for nine years and did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. After the military, he worked as a janitor and then lost his job. The familys savings soon ran out, leaving them homeless.The Kids Count report shows the percentage of children whose parents dont have secure employment has been increasing. Thats more than one-third of children in each of the four states at the bottom of the Kids Count list."Growing up in poverty, it just has these terrible repercussions and you see these associations with much lower rates of high school graduation, lower performance overall in school, much lower rates of college attendance and the cycle perpetuates," said Curtis Skinner, director of Family Economic Security at the National Center for Children in Poverty.Skinner said the centers research is showing a troubling trend in the aftermath of the recession: Poverty rates are rising in what used to be the middle class, in two-parent households and in families where parents have college educations.While there is a lag in the Kids Count data, officials in New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada believe some of their numbers will start to turn around in the coming years thanks to investments in education, particularly pre-kindergarten programs.New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez has pushed for doubling pre-K funding and funneling more money to early literacy and high school graduation efforts."Clearly, doing things the way theyve always been done hasnt worked for our kids," said Enrique Knell, a spokesman for the governor. "And reform efforts must include ending the practice of setting our children up for failure by passing them on to the next grade level when they cant read."The well-being of their children has been the motivating factor for both the Hutchinson and Roper families. They want something better for their kids, and they say things are starting to turn around."Finally, being to the point of stabilizing and being able to get the kids out of this environment, thats a good feeling," Elimar Roper said.	2013-06-24

Many see themselves as worse off now than during the recession, a two-part Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey of workers and employers shows.ADVERTISEMENTThe survey revealed that many people at the lowest rung in the workplace view their jobs as a dead end. Half were "not too" or "not at all" confident that their jobs would help them achieve long-term career goals. And only 41 percent of workers at the same place for more than a decade reported ever receiving a promotion.Yet 44 percent of employers surveyed said its hard to recruit people with appropriate skills or experiences to do lower-wage jobs, particularly in manufacturing (54 percent). While 88 percent of employers said they were investing in training and education for employee advancement, awareness and use of such programs among the lower-wage workers was only modest.Although President Barack Obama made it a national goal to "equip our citizens with the skills and training" to compete for good jobs, the survey shows a U.S. workforce that has grown increasingly polarized, with workers and their bosses seeing many things differently.Seventy-two percent of employers at big companies and 58 percent at small ones say there is a "great deal" or "some" opportunity for worker advancement. But, asked the same question, 67 percent of all low-wage workers said they saw "a little" or "no opportunity" at their jobs for advancement.Through last month, the economy had recovered only about 5.7 million of the 8.7 million jobs shed in the deepest downturn since the Great Depression. Low-wage jobs are usually the first to come back following a recession. While the outlook clearly is improving, economic growth remains anemic and unemployment is a still-high 7.7 percent.Ronald Moore, 48, of Lebanon, Ind., is among those who have seen their situation improve. He started his own home-inspection company three years ago after he couldnt find enough work as a truck driver. But "nobody was buying homes, so no one needed an inspection," he said. "It was pretty rough in the beginning." Now he operates a custom cabinet business, where business is starting to improve. Slowly.To gauge the experiences and perspectives of lower-wage workers, the AP-NORC Center conducted two separate surveys. A sample of 1,606 workers earning $35,000 or less annually was surveyed last summer, while a companion poll of 1,487 employers of such workers was conducted from November through January.Roughly 65 percent of the jobs the U.S. economy added since the recession officially ended in June 2009 have been lower-wage ones.Despite those numerical gains, "lower-income households have been hit very hard and have not benefited as much from the recovery," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodys Analytics. "Their real wages are going nowhere. And this is a group that has more debt, fewer assets, is less likely to own a home or stocks and with little capacity to absorb higher gasoline prices."Economists also say low-wage workers were hit particularly hard by an increase in Social Security payroll taxes resulting from "fiscal cliff" negotiations late last year between Obama and Congress.A degree of economic "self-righting" will happen as more middle-income and higher-income jobs come back and economic growth accelerates, said Robert Trumble, director of the Labor Studies Center at Virginia Commonwealth University. "But the situation weve been facing for the last half-dozen years or so has been tough. And the lower your income, the tougher it is.""Some things are better. But there are still some things that are still hard," said Sarah Mueller, 33, of Palm Harbor, Fla., who found work as a Montessori teacher two years ago after working as a part-time and substitute teacher. "With student loans, people are still struggling — Im one of those people — to pay back student loans that are astronomical," she said.Seventy-four percent of lower-wage workers say it is "difficult" or "very difficult" for them and their families to get ahead financially. Half thought their financial situation was somewhat or much worse than in 2008.Many worry a lot or some (71 percent) about being unable to pay their bills, unexpected medical expenses (70 percent), losing their job (54 percent) or keeping up with their mortgage or rent (53 percent).Many reported stagnant (44 percent) or declining (20 percent) wages over the past five years.Employers and workers tend to agree that employees themselves hold the bulk of the responsibility for helping workers to get ahead in their careers, but employers are more apt to place some of that responsibility on high schools and colleges.Despite their many frustrations, 74 percent of low-income workers said they were very or somewhat satisfied with their jobs. Yet 90 percent of all workers said they were satisfied with their job, according to an AP-GfK poll conducted in September.The surge in low-wage jobs seems to have escaped notice by employers, the survey suggests. Just 22 percent of them said their organizations lower-wage workforce grew over the last four years and only 34 percent expect it to increase in the coming four years.Lower-wage workers are also pessimistic about the overall direction of the country, with 7 in 10 saying "wrong direction," above the 60 percent of all adults who said so in AP-GfK polling conducted at the same time."Lower-wage jobs are coming back first," said labor economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-leaning think tank. "But its all bleak and its all due to lack of demand for work to be done. Were still not getting more than just what we need to hang on," Shierholz said. "These last few months have looked better, but we cannot yet claim robust recovery by any stretch."Lena Hughes, 31, of Indianapolis, a certified hospital nursing assistant, would agree."Everybody is struggling financially. Its hard to get jobs still," she said. "I dont think its getting any better."The surveys were sponsored by the Joyce Foundation, the Hitachi Foundation and NORC at the University of Chicago. The Joyce Foundation works to improve workforce development and education systems to assist job seekers who may lack skills or credentials. The Hitachi Foundation aims to expand business practices that improve economic opportunities for less well-off workers while benefiting business.The worker survey was conducted online using the GfK KnowledgePanel and by telephone by interviewers from NORC from Aug. 1 through Sept. 6, 2012. The employer survey was conducted online and by phone by NORC from Nov. 12, 2012, through Jan. 31, 2013. The margin of sampling error for the survey of workers was plus or minus 2.9 percentage points; for employers, it was 4.5 points.___Associated Press News Survey Specialist Dennis Junius and writer Stacey A.

The gain shows the housing recovery is strengthening ahead of the all-important spring buying season.The Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index climbed 8.1 percent in the 12 months ending in January. Thats up from a 6.8 annual gain in December. Prices rose in all 20 cities. Eight markets posted double-digit increases, led by a 23.2 percent gain in Phoenix. Prices rose 17.5 percent in San Francisco and 15.3 percent in Las Vegas, one of the nations hardest hit markets during the crisis.ADVERTISEMENTPrices rose in 11 of 20 cities on a month-over-month basis. The monthly numbers are not seasonally adjusted and reflect the slower winter buying period.The S&P/Case-Shiller index covers roughly half of U.S. homes. It measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The January figures are the latest available.Home prices nationwide are still 29 percent below their peak reached at the height of the housing bubble in August 2006. They are only back to where they were in August 2003.Still, steady price increases should help make the housing recovery sustainable and add to economic growth. Higher home prices encourage more people to buy before prices rise further."Over time, persistently rising house prices also boost household wealth, make lenders more willing to lend because the asset theyre underwriting is appreciating, and ease pressure on local government budgets that get revenue from property taxes," Jonathan Basile, director of economics at Credit Suisse, wrote in a research note.Other recent reports have shown a strengthening recovery in housing, helped by near-record-low mortgage rates. Construction of single-family homes rose in February at the fastest pace in 4 ½ years. Sales of previously owned homes rose last month to their fastest pace in more than three years.More Americans are putting their houses on the market, suggesting they believe the housing market will continue to strengthen.The number of available homes for sale rose 10 percent last month, the first monthly gain since April. Even with the gain, the inventory of homes for sale was still 19 percent below a year ago.Investment in housing, including home construction, contributed to the nations economic growth last year for the first time since 2005; from 2006 through 2011, a drop in housing investment dragged economic growth down.	2013-03-26

But orders that reflect business investment plans rose slightly.The Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders for durable goods declined 5.7 percent in March, after a 4.3 percent gain the previous month. Februarys figure was revised lower.ADVERTISEMENTDurable goods are items expected to last at least three years. Orders tend to fluctuate sharply from month to month.The steep March decline was exacerbated by a 48.2 percent fall in commercial aircraft orders. Still, even excluding aircraft and transportations demand, orders dropped 1.4 percent, the second straight decline.One positive sign in the report: so-called core capital goods, which include machinery and equipment, ticked up 0.2 percent. Economists pay close attention to these orders because they strip out defense and transportation orders and are a good measure of companies expansion plans.The slight increase in core capital goods followed a sharp drop in February. Still, economists expect business investment contributed to economic growth in the January-March quarter.The economy likely grew at a healthy 3.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, up from only a 0.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter. The Commerce Department will release its first estimate for January-March growth on Friday.But many economists expect growth has begun to slow to a rate of 2 percent or less in the current April-June quarter.One reason is Social Security taxes have reduced Americans take-home pay this year. Thats starting to limit their spending power.Also, across-the-board government spending cuts that began on March 1 will likely weigh on growth, including manufacturing.Some reports suggest that manufacturing has already started to weaken after showing signs of strength over the winter. Strong auto production hasnt been enough to offset broader slowdowns in other industries.Factory output slipped in March, according to a Federal Reserve report last week. And a survey of purchasing managers earlier this month found that manufacturing expanded at a slower pace in March compared with February. The Institute for Supply Managements survey showed that new orders and production declined sharply.	2013-04-24

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reports quarterly financial results on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2013. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)The Associated PressNEW YORK –  Wal-Mart shoppers — much like many Americans — still feel like theyre in a recession.In the uneven economic recovery, their bills are going up, but their wages are not. While the well-heeled crowd benefits from gains in the stock market, Wal-Mart shoppers are still struggling with a higher payroll tax. And shopping for bargains isnt a hobby, but a necessity.ADVERTISEMENTFor these reasons, the worlds largest retailer on Thursday cut its annual outlook for the second time in three months and gave fourth-quarter guidance thats below Wall Streets expectations.The forecast, which comes as rivals Nordstrom, Kohls and Macys reported mixed results, shows how vulnerable Wal-Mart — and its customers — are to economic ups and downs. Wal-Mart shoppers, who on average make $45,000 a year, were squeezed by the recession that began at the end of 2007 and have struggled to recover since it ended in 2009.Theyve been dealing with a 2 percentage point increase in the Social Security payroll tax since Jan. 1. A partial 16-day government shutdown this year also hurt business in areas with large military bases. And the Nov. 1 expiration of a temporary boost in government food stamps could also hurt customers ability to spend, though the discounter says its too early to know.On top of that, Wal-Mart is facing increased competition from online rivals like Amazon.com, which is opening warehouse hubs closer to cities to speed up delivery. Another threat: Dollar stores, which have convenient locations and name-brand products at discounted prices."The retail environment, both in stores and online, remains competitive," said Mike Duke, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. "At the same time, some customers feel uncertainty about the economy, government, jobs stability and their need to take care of their families through the holidays."Wal-Mart earned $3.74 billion, or $1.14 per share, in the three months that ended Oct. 31. That compares with $3.64 billion, or $1.08 per share, a year earlier. Net sales rose 1.6 percent to $114.88 billion. On a constant currency basis, net sales would have been $116.2 billion.Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.13 per share on net sales of $116.9 billion.Overall, total sales increased 2.4 percent for Wal-Marts U.S. business, 1.1 percent at Sams Clubs and 0.2 percent at Wal-Marts international business.But Wal-Mart reported a decline in a figure that the industry uses to gauge a companys performance. Revenue at stores open at least a year fell 0.1 percent for all U.S. stores, but included a 1.1 percent increase at Sams Clubs.Wal-Marts U.S. stores, which account for 58 percent of the companys total sales, had a third straight quarter of declines, with revenue at stores open at least a year falling 0.3 percent. Wal-Mart blamed slower-than-expected spending in the beginning of the quarter, but said business picked up in September and October.There was a bright spot. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 3.4 percent at its smaller Neighborhood Market stores, which are only about 38,000 square feet and carry fresh produce, meat and beauty products. Wal-Mart has 300 Neighborhood Market stores but plans to use them to grow its business.Going forward, Wal-Mart, like its rivals, is making changes heading into the holiday shopping season in the U.S. Its bringing back its holiday layaway program and tweaking prices on TVs and other popular holiday products more than last year. The company also pulled up some deals reserved for Thanksgiving weekend, having them start on Nov. 1.Wal-Mart said it expects adjusted earnings per share to be $1.60 to $1.70 for the fourth quarter. For the year, it expects $5.11 to $5.21, compared with its forecast of $5.10 and $5.30 per share in August. That was downgraded from Mays forecast.Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $1.69 per share for the fourth quarter and $5.19 per share for the full year, according to research firm FactSet.Wal-Mart shares closed up 18 cents to $79.08.	2013-11-14

Despite the gain, the level remains consistent with moderate job growth.The Labor Department said Thursday that the less volatile four-week average increased by 2,500 to 348,250.ADVERTISEMENTApplications are a proxy for layoffs. Since January, they have fallen 6 percent. That suggests companies are cutting fewer jobs.At the same time, hiring has been steady, despite an increase in taxes on Jan. 1 and steep federal spending cuts that began in March. Solid consumer spending and a rebound in housing have helped the economy weather the fiscal drag.Employers added 175,000 jobs in May, nearly matching the average monthly gain for the past year. The unemployment rate ticked up to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent, but for a good reason: More Americans were confident they could find work and began searching for a job.The Federal Reserve on Wednesday offered a brighter outlook for both the job market and the economy. And Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed is likely to slow its bond-buying program later this year and end it next year if the economy continues to strengthen.Fed officials upgraded their economic projections. They now expect the unemployment rate to fall to between 6.5 percent and 6.8 percent by the end of 2014. Thats lower than their March forecast of 6.7 percent to 7 percent.There have been other signs the job market is strengthening. The Labor Department said last week that more Americans quit their jobs in April compared with March. That points to confidence in the job market, since most workers dont quit until they have another job or are sure they can find one. More quits also opens up jobs for other workers, or the unemployed, to take.Also last week, a survey of chief executives at the largest U.S. companies showed that they are more optimistic about sales in the next six months and plan to add more workers.	2013-06-20

Findlay, Ohio-based Cooper said it does not agree with such a price reduction.ADVERTISEMENTInvestors are increasingly concerned that the deal could fall apart. Under the terms of the agreement, if the deal is delayed past Dec. 31 it can be terminated without penalty. If it is completed, the deal would create the seventh-largest tire company in the world.Shares of Cooper fell nearly 13 percent to $25.81 in afternoon trading. Its stock has traded between $18.38 and $34.79 in the past 52 weeks, peaking in June when the deal was announced.The deal between Cooper and Apollo had been approved by the boards of both companies and Cooper shareholders.However, union talks led to a delay and the deals future has been complicated by escalating conflicts between the companies.Cooper filed a complaint in a Delaware court on Friday asking that Apollo be required to quickly close on the deal. It accused Apollo of dragging its feet on union talks to either back out of the deal or give it leverage to ask for a lower price. An agreement must be reached with the union for the deal to close.Apollo said Sunday that it is working to resolve complex union matters and finds Coopers request to speed matters up unreasonable. Apollo is also seeking a lower price than the original $35 per share because of added costs for union matters.Cooper said in a regulatory filing that it does not agree that any such reduction is due.Apollo also argued that Cooper has not provided sufficient information that it needs regarding a Chinese subsidiary. The U.S. company said that it is working to resolve issues with its Chinese partner.	2013-10-07

That comes after sales plunged 14.1 percent in July to a 390,000 annual rate.ADVERTISEMENTThe rebound in new-home sales could ease worries that higher rates have started to dampen sales. Still, some buyers could be racing to close deals before rates rise further. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has risen more than a full percentage point since May.New-homes sales were 12.6 percent higher in August than a year ago.

Both Teruyuki and Haruna were children when Japan’s bubble economy burst more than two decades ago. Now, they have little interest in the stock market. (AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama)The Associated PressKOUNOSU, Japan –  To understand why people are so cautious with their money five years after the financial crisis, The Associated Press interviewed consumers around the world. Here is a profile of one couple:Names: Teruyuki and Haruna KawabataADVERTISEMENTHome: Kounosu, Japan, a suburb of TokyoAges: He is 36; she is 32Teruyuki Kawabata is worried he could get laid off, so he lives frugally."Jobs for life are a dream," he says.He and his wife, Haruna, rarely use credit cards. Their idea of splurging is a nice haircut or occasionally going out for Korean barbecue. They hope to grow their own food on a farm next to their newly built home in Kounosu and live off the land.Teruyuki is whats known in Japan as a "contract worker." He does the same work as a full-time employee but without the job security of one. Japans two-tier employment system has drawn fire as unfair, but is increasingly used by companies that want flexibility in an anemic economy to cut staff fast.Teruyuki works for a major telecommunications company, but wouldnt give details because hes afraid for his job. "Im not sure when my contract will end," he says. "... I may get fired tomorrow."For all the uncertainty, the Kawabatas took a gamble recently. They took out a mortgage last year to build their home, which is on land that Harunas parents own. They borrowed 28 million yen ($280,000) for 35 years at an annual interest rate that wont climb above 1.88 percent. They say they borrowed because they feared rates could rise.The move is unusual. Since the financial crisis, Japanese have shed debt, not added to it, despite low rates that have made it cheap to borrow. Per adult, personal debt in Japan dropped 3 percent in the 4 ½ years after 2008, according to Credit Suisse.In other ways, the Kawabatas are more typical of their generation. Both Teruyuki and Haruna, who works at a department store, were children when Japans bubble economy burst more than two decades ago, so they never experienced the boom years of the 1980s. They have little interest in the stock market. They scratch out a living on their modest incomes, saving a little here and there."I dont see a goal in this economy," Teruyuki says. "Those are the times we are in."	2013-10-06

(AP)Curt Schilling was the toast of New England when he led the Boston Red Sox to World Series glory in 2007, but these days hes a goat after his ill-fated video game company went belly-up and left Rhode Island holding a near-$100 million loan guarantee that now threatens the Ocean States bond rating.Moodys Investor Services downgraded the state-backed "moral obligation" bonds Schillings 38 Studios had already defaulted on after learning state lawmakers were considering a second default. The bond rating agency also said it could downgrade the states overall rating if it doesnt honor the debt, which started as a $75 million loan and has ballooned with interest. Schillings company, which once employed 450 people, folded in 2012, with the onetime superstar — who earned more than $100 million in salary during his career — saying he lost his own fortune.ADVERTISEMENTNot honoring the debt would save the state $89.2 million, but could make it more expensive for the state to borrow money over the next decade, according to a report by the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council.“Broadly, default on the payment for the 38 Studios loan guaranty will have an impact on the state in many ways, both seen and unseen,” the report stated. “However, there are no current precedents for the consequences of state default. In fact, no state has defaulted on a bond since the Depression, when Arkansas defaulted on a 1933 payment.”- Rhode Island Public Expenditure CouncilMoodys said it acted after learning some lawmakers favor defaulting.“The potential for a decision by the legislature to withhold funds to replenish the debt service reserve signals potential unwillingness to honor its obligations to bondholders,” Moody’s said in a statement. “Selectivity regarding which obligations to honor leads us to question our confidence in the full faith and credit of the state and its willingness to honor its other debt obligations compared to otherwise similarly-rated states.”Gov. Lincoln Chafee wants the state to pay the debt and an $8.2 billion House budget proposal includes outstanding payments for the Schilling debt. Christine Hunsinger, a spokeswoman for Chafee, said the Democratic governor is “cautiously optimistic” that the new proposal will ultimately pass.“While the governor has said all along that it wouldn’t be in the state’s best interest to not pay the moral obligation debt, the statement from Moody’s makes that clearer,” Hunsinger told FoxNews.com. “So the governor is cautiously optimistic since the House budget does contain the payment that the full House and Senate will approve the moral obligation payment.”Schilling, 46, retired in 2009 after 20 seasons. He won 216 games and three World Series rings and is perhaps best remembered for pitching in the 2004 American League Championship for the Boston Red Sox with a blood-stained sock due to an injured ankle. He has reportedly earned more than $114 million in salary throughout his career but said during an interview last summer that his failed venture has cost him his entire fortune.“I’m tapped out,” he told WEEI-FM in Boston.Schilling, whose company relocated from Massachusetts in 2010 after Rhode Island offered a loan guarantee based on state officials’ claims that it would lead to 450 jobs and millions in tax revenue, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.The company took its name from Schilling’s longtime uniform number and entered bankruptcy in May 2012, leaving more than 300 employees in Rhode Island and Maryland out of work.Schilling has said life for his family will likely change as a result of the massive loss, but he’s not seeking condolences."Im not asking for sympathy,” he said last summer.  “It was my choice. I chose to do this, I wanted to build this, I wanted to create the jobs and create something that had a long-standing, world-changing effect. And we were close. We were close to getting there, and it fell apart."The Associated Press contributed to this report.	2013-06-19

"Bernanke started talking about continuing (stimulus) and that kind of fueled things."The Dow pared its gain after Bernanke told lawmakers in a question-and-answer session that the central bank could not rule out tapering its stimulus programs by the fall.By 12:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time the Dow was up 100 points at 15,488, an increase of 0.7 percent.The Standard and Poors 500 index rose 11 points to 1,680, an increase of 0.7 percent.The Federal Reserve has been keeping short-term interest rates near zero to encourage people and businesses to borrow and spend more. The Fed has also been buying $85 billion worth of bonds each month to keep long-term interest rates low.Later on Wednesday, the Fed will release minutes of its latest policy meeting.The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that sales of previously occupied homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.97 million in April, helped by a jump in the number of homes available for sale.All 10 industry groups in the S&P 500 were higher. Health-care stocks led the index with a gain of 1.6 percent.Among stocks making big moves:--Bristol-Myers Squibb jumped 7 percent, or $3.16, to $47.22 after a Citigroup analyst raised his rating on the drugmaker. The analyst said the company could be a big winner with a group of cancer treatments under development.--Saks rose $1.89 to $15.57, or 14 percent, after The New York Post reported the luxury retailer had hired Goldman Sachs to explore options for the company, including a possible sale. A spokesman for Saks declined to comment.--Target fell $2.54, or 4 percent, to $68.73 after announcing a 26 percent drop in first-quarter profits. The company also said full-year earnings may come in lower than previously expected.-- Homebuilders rose after the home sales report came out. Lennar rose $1.18 to $43.65, or 3 percent. Toll Brothers, which also reported a 46 percent surge in second-quarter earnings, jumped $2.63, or 7 percent, to $38.63.On Tuesday, stocks rose after James Bullard, president of the St. Louis branch of the Federal Reserve, told an audience in Germany that the central bank should continue buying bonds.Both the Dow and the S&P 500 are up 18 percent since the start of the year.The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose six points to 1,003, a gain of 0.4 percent. The index is at a record high and is headed for its first close above 1,000 points.The surging Russell is a sign that investors are increasingly comfortable with risk. Unlike many of their big counterparts, small companies lack the financial resources to easily ride out economic downturns and investors worried about future economic growth tend to avoid them.The Dow and the S&P are also at records.Another sign of surging confidence on Wednesday: Investors sold Treasury bonds, which are considered one of the safest assets. Selling of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note pushed its yield up to 2.02 percent from 1.93 percent late Tuesday.The Nasdaq composite was up 11 points at 3,518, or 0.7 percent.The price of gold fell $6.50 to $1,371 an ounce, an drop of 0.5 percent.

Thats up from an initial estimate of 1.9 percent and much stronger than the 1.8 percent rate from April through June.ADVERTISEMENTProductivity rose because economic growth was much stronger than previously estimated in the third quarter. Productivity is the amount of output per hour of work.Labor costs fell in the third quarter, evidence that inflation will remain low.Higher productivity enables companies to pay employees more without sparking inflation. But greater productivity can also slow hiring if it shows companies dont need more workers to boost output.	2013-12-16

Those members say the costs likely outweigh the benefits. A few others saw the risks as increasing quickly and said the purchases would likely need to be reduced "before long."Many members said an improved job market could lead them to slow purchases within a few months, and a few said economic conditions would likely justify continuing the program until late this year.Despite the division over when to end the program, the minutes indicated that many of the Feds members want to see sustained improvement in the job market — from a wide range of economic indicators — before making any decision to reduce the pace of purchases.After the March meeting, the Fed said the economy had strengthened but that it still needed its efforts to help lower high unemployment. In addition to continuing the bond purchases, the Fed stuck by its plan to keep short-term interest rates at record lows at least until unemployment falls to 6.5 percent.The economy had added an average of 220,000 jobs a month from November through February, including 268,000 jobs in February — the last report available when the Fed met in March.But a weak March employment report is likely to make policymakers even more supportive of keeping the measures in place for the foreseeable future. Employers added just 88,000 net jobs last month, the fewest in nine months.The unemployment rate dropped to a four-year low of 7.6 percent. However, the rate fell only because more people stopped looking for work and were no longer counted as unemployed.	2013-04-10

(U.S. Treasury)The redesigned $100 bill might not be coming to a wallet near you so soon after all.The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has reportedly hit a production snafu at one of the country’s two currency factories, according to a document cited by The New Yorker, causing the agency to ask its Texas facility to expedite production ahead of an Oct. 8 deadline.ADVERTISEMENT“The cause of the latest blunder is something known as ‘mashing,’ according to Darlene Anderson, a spokeswoman for the bureau,” The New Yorker reports. “When too much ink is applied to the paper, the lines of the artwork aren’t as crisp as they should be, like when a kid tries to carefully color inside the lines — using watercolors and a fat paintbrush.”The redesigned bill — which will feature a Liberty Bell that changes color and small 3-D images — had been scheduled for release in early 2011, but massive printing errors in addition to the recent “mashing” problem has plagued the effort.- Larry Felix, Bureau of Engraving and PrintingRecent batches of the bills from the Washington, D.C., plant contained “clearly unacceptable” versions intermixed with passable ones, according to a July memo to employees from Larry Felix, the bureau’s director. As a result, the Federal Reserve is returning more than 30 million $100 bills while another $30 billion in bills awaits examination. Federal officials have told the agency that they will not accept any Benjamin Franklin notes produced at the Washington facility until further notice.That error, according to The Atlantic Wire, is a $3.79 million mistake since the bills cost 12 cents each to produce and will cost another $12,000 to destroy them.“There are dire consequences involved here because BEP sells Federal Reserve notes to the Board to finance our entire operation,” Felix wrote in the memo. “If BEP does not meet the order, the BEP does not get paid.”Click for more from The New Yorker.	2013-08-14

Federal wildlife officials are expected to make a decision Friday Oct. 25, 2013 about listing populations of sage grouse in Nevada and California as an endangered species. Miners, ranchers and others that operate on public lands have opposed the protections as an economic disaster. (AP Photo/Rawlins Daily Times, Jerret Raffety, File)The Associated PressSAN FRANCISCO –  Federal wildlife officials on Friday proposed to list as threatened populations of greater sage grouse in Nevada and California in an effort to save the struggling species, a decision that promises to pose new challenges for ranching and energy development in the West.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that invasive species and energy development in the desert have had a devastating effect on the large, ground-dwelling birds populations, said Ted Koch, Nevada state supervisor for the service.ADVERTISEMENT"Its not the 11th hour for sage grouse here, but it is maybe the 10th hour," Koch said. "And thats good news. It means we have some time and space to turn things around."The service found multiple threats facing this specific sub-population of the sage grouse, a chicken-size bird whose males have a large white tuft of feathers around their necks.The service estimates there are only about 5,000 of the birds left.Non-native pinyon pine and juniper trees introduced to the habitat and power lines have given low-to-the-ground perches for raptors, which eat the grouse, Koch said.The service also found that an invasive grass from Asia that burns easily has helped decimate sagebrush, which is key to the grouses survival.Industry, federal and local officials say a local effort already underway to save the bird is a promising start. Passed in 2012, the plan is being used by federal officials to help clear red tape for industry in the area.Some state legislators greeted the proposed listing with suspicion, saying it could have wide-ranging economic impact on the rural economies in the region. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said the decision will have "major ramifications" on the way of life in parts of Nevada and California."This listing is further proof that we need to work together to protect sensitive species before they get to such a dismal point and negatively affect our rural economies," Reid said in a statement.The final decision on the services proposal will occur next year, and the public will have 60 days to comment.Ranchers, miners and energy developers who use the mostly public lands that serve as the sage grouses habitat have opposed the listing, saying it would have a deep economic impact in the rural West.Fridays proposed listing comes as the service is also determining whether the entire western sage grouse population should be federally protected. Sage grouse also live in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wyoming and parts of Canada.Ranchers worry that protections will scuttle or block outright vast grazing areas. They say it adds a lot of uncertainty to any plans to expand or even launch habitat restoration plans on their lands."For guys talking about expansion and going to the bank for loan, Im not sure what the bank is going to tell me," said JJ Goicoechea, a rancher and veterinarian who is president of the Nevada Cattlemens Association."And the rural economy is heavily dependent on those ranching families, who generate revenues that help keep towns and schools running. Whats going to happen to those rural communities?" he asked.The Center for Biological Diversity, which sued the service to protect the sage grouse, said the decision was long overdue."The sage grouse we have here in Nevada and California is a true symbol of all that is wild -- what a relief that its finally getting the protection it needs to survive," Rob Mrowka, a Nevada-based center ecologist, said in a statement.___Associated Press reporter Michelle Rindels contributed from Las Vegas.___Jason Dearen can be reached on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/JHDearen	2013-10-25

You guys have seen teams break it down: you come up for the team prayer, you put your hands in and you say, `Broncos on 3, and you go out to the field.We did it three times tonight, Manning said. We did it, went back and sat down for 10 minutes and came back up again. `Broncos on 3, now sit down for another 10 minutes. I know they had to deal with it, too, but it took us a while to get started.Wearing an orange-and-gray glove like the one he wore on that icy January night the last time these teams met, Manning took a while to get warmed up against a defense that had to replace seven Super Bowl starters.He ditched the glove when the rain stopped — and then was unstoppable.Peyton had an amazing night, Broncos coach John Fox said. Peytons had a lot of amazing nights.Not like this, though.Manning is the sixth QB in NFL history to throw seven TD passes in a game and the first since Joe Kapp for Minnesota against Baltimore on Sept. 28, 1969.The others read like a Whos Who of passers who defied the 3-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust days long before the NFL became so pass-happy: Sid Luckman, Adrian Burk, George Blanda and Y.A. Tittle.Tom Brady never did it. Nor Brett Favre, Dan Marino, Joe Montana, Steve Young or Terry Bradshaw. Or, for that matter, No. 7 himself, John Elway, who had his binoculars trained on the action from his perch in the luxury seats.I felt like we had to keep scoring because Baltimore can score at any time, said Manning, who was 27 of 42 for 462 yards with no interceptions for an off-the-charts quarterback rating of 141.1.Hes phenomenal. To continue to come out every year and put that kind of performance on for us, its amazing, Julius Thomas said.All part of a thorough thrashing of the team that put a harsh end to what had looked like a Super Bowl-bound 2012 in Denver. The rematch came nearly eight months after Baltimore beat Denver 38-35 in double overtime on an icy January night in the same stadium.The hero on that night was Jacoby Jones, who caught a 70-yard TD pass over Rahim Moore with 31 seconds left to tie it in regulation. This time, his night was cut short when he went back to field a punt in the first half and teammate Brynden Trawick plowed into him, sending him to the sideline with a sprained right knee.Thats an experience problem, hes an inexperienced guy, Ravens coach John Harbaugh said.When the teams finally took the field after the long delay, it was clear how much had changed.Pass rusher Elvis Dumervil moved from Denver to Baltimore as part of a bizarre, fax-infused contract squabble. Receiver Brandon Stokley also switched sides. The Broncos lost their best defender, Von Miller, to a drug suspension while Baltimore had to rebuild its D after losing emotional leaders Ed Reed and Ray Lewis.The Ravens suffered another loss of sorts when they were forced to play the seasons traditional opener on the road because of a conflict with the Orioles in Baltimore. The NFL hung a Flacco banner above Denvers stadium, but he hardly felt at home.Armed with a new six-year, $120.6 million contract, he matched the Broncos score for score in the first half and went into the locker room up 17-14 but had to play catch-up after falling behind 35-17 early in the third quarter. His final numbers: 34 of 62 for 362 yards with two TDs and two interceptions.It was a pretty good game for a while and it got away from us, Flacco said.It was such a runaway, the Broncos were throwing away touchdowns by the end. Linebacker Danny Trevathan fumbled his pick-6 just shy of the goal line, pulling a Leon Lett imitation by celebrating too soon and the ball bounced out of the end zone for a touchback instead of a touchdown.No worries.Denver was ahead 42-17 at that point.It was just a young mistake, Trevathan said. It was kind of selfish. Im going to take full responsibility. Im going to grow from it.Mannings seventh TD pass was a blitz-beater that Demaryius Thomas caught in the left flat and raced up the seam for a 78-yard score that capped Mannings big night.It didnt seem like that many, Welker said. Youre just sitting there like, `That was seven? Because hes so nonchalant about it.Flacco could only marvel at Mannings seven TDs.Thats a sweet way to start a season, Flacco said. You get ahead throwing that many touchdowns. I mean, shoot, hes almost halfway to 20 already.Demaryius Thomas finished with five receptions for 161 yards, Julius Thomas had five catches for 110 yards and Welker led the way with nine grabs for 67 yards.Welker is the first receiver to catch TD passes from both Brady and Manning.He has said he cant compare the two pre-eminent QBs, saying thats like choosing between Michaelangelo and Picasso.This night was certainly a masterpiece for Manning.	2013-09-06

"I think if I am in great shape, Ill go there and do what I have to do. I think it will be a good time to retire on top."Winning another three golds in Moscow last month made him the most decorated athlete in world championship history with eight gold and two silvers. He has six gold medals from the Olympics."If I want to be among the greats of (Muhammad) Ali and Pele and all these guys, I have to continue dominating until I retire," Bolt said ahead of his final race this season in the 100 at Fridays Van Damme Memorial.Bolt won the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and at last years London Games. He won the same triple at the 2009 worlds before repeating that feat in Moscow last month.At 27, Bolt has the experience to know that a lax season midway between Olympics can hurt him. In 2010, a soft entry into the year and subsequent injury cost him almost a full season."I kind of didnt do much in the offseason and then got injured and had to start from scratch. So this season, I will not make that mistake again," Bolt said.Like 2010, next season has no major championships, but Bolt is thinking of new goals for 2014.He already owns the 100 and 200 world records and shares the 4x100 with his Jamaican teammates. He acknowledges the 100 record of 9.58 seconds will be extremely tough to better, but he hopes to improve on the 19.19 he ran in the 200 in Berlin four years ago."I have learned, I have mastered the art of running the turn," Bolt said of the 200. "So if I can stay injury free and be in good shape, then it is possible for me to definitely go after the world record."As a Jamaican, Bolt can compete in the Commonwealth Games, too, something he has yet to do. Next year, the event will be held in Glasgow, Scotland."I have never been to Commonwealths and so it is always good to add to your collection of gold medals," Bolt said.	2013-09-04

(AP Photo/Ben Margot, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  The U.S. economy grew at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the October-December quarter, significantly slower than first thought, reflecting slower consumer spending than initially estimated.The severe winter weather is expected to slow growth further in the current quarter, but as the snows melt, economists believe growth will rebound.ADVERTISEMENTThe Commerce Department says the downward revision from an initial 3.2 percent estimate for the fourth quarter primarily reflected a downgrade in consumer spending, which is now estimated to have expanded at 2.6 percent rate, still the best showing in nearly two years. But it is below the previous 3.3 percent estimate.For all of 2013, the economy grew at a lackluster 1.9 percent, but analysts expect growth will rebound in 2014, possibly as high as 3 percent.	2014-02-28

Puskar)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Consumers increased their borrowing in January on autos and student loans but cut back on their credit card use.Consumer borrowing rose $13.7 billion in January following an even larger $15.9 billion rise in December, the Federal Reserve reported Friday.ADVERTISEMENTThe category that includes auto and student loans increased $13.9 billion while the category that covers credit cards fell $226 million, marking the third time in the past five months that credit card loans have declined.The big overall increase pushed total borrowing to a record $3.11 trillion. Gains in borrowing are seen as an encouraging sign that people are more confident and willing to take on debt to finance consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.That has been the trend over the past year. Most of the gains have come in the category that covers auto and student loans. Credit card borrowing has been rising more slowly.Borrowing on credit cards plunged after the Great Recession as financial institutions tightened lending standards and households became more cautious about taking on high-interest debt at a time when millions of people were losing their jobs.Even with recent gains, credit card debt in January was still 16.2 percent below its peak above $1 trillion reached in July 2008. Credit card debt stood at $856.2 billion in January, up just 0.9 percent from a year ago.The measure of auto loans and student loans in January stood at $2.26 trillion, up 7.8 percent from a year ago. It has been up every month but one since May 2010.A separate quarterly report on consumer credit done by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that student loan debt has been the biggest driver of borrowing since the recession officially ended in June 2009.The Feds borrowing report tracks credit card debt, auto loans and student loans but not mortgages or home equity loans.	2014-03-07

We are looking at each case individually, addressing those recipients who are suspected of misrepresenting their eligibility for benefits or defrauding the system," Suzy Sonnier, the secretary of state at the Department of Children and Family Services, said in a statement.The frenzy at some stores was likened to the busiest shopping day of the year. "It was worse than any Black Friday,” Springhill Police Chief Will Lynd told local station KSLA-TV.Shelves were picked clean in a mob scene that left employees rattled. Walmart spokeswoman Kayla Whaling told the station the company made a conscious decision to keep ringing up goods rather than to cut people off.But when order was restored and the cards began reading properly, it became clear that some customers were out to take advantage of the taxpayer-funded program. One woman had $700 worth of merchandise in her cart and an EBT card with a balance of just 49 cents.Problems involving Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards, the government payments to the poor that are administered by states with the help of private companies, plagued at least 17 states Oct. 10 and 11, creating retail riots. At Louisiana stores in Springhill and Mansfield, cards registered no spending limits, prompting recipients to go on buying binges. Stores, not taxpayers are on the hook for the excess money spent at the locations. It is up to the stores and local prosecutors to determine if charges should be leveled against abusers. The Advocates report says that violators will receive a letter about the disqualification along with how to appeal the matter. In the most severe cases, under Federal guidelines, individuals can lose the privilege permanently.A worker at a soup kitchen in Alexandria said cutting off food stamps from a family would be detrimental. She said most recipients she sees receive a $25-a-month stipend.

And rising home prices have helped homeowners who were "underwater" on their mortgage — when they owed more than the home is worth — return to positive equity. That, in turn, has opened the door for those borrowers to qualify for refinancing."So as prices come up, more and more of those people come off the cusp and are actually able to take advantage of those low rates," said Tim Martin, TransUnions group vice president of U.S. housing.The rate of late payments on home loans has been steadily improving over the past four quarters.The second-quarter mortgage delinquency rate represents the biggest quarterly decline on record for TransUnion, whose data go back to 1992.Even so, the mortgage delinquency rate is still above the 1 percent to 2 percent average historical range, an indication that many homeowners still are struggling to make their payments.Before the housing bust, mortgage delinquencies were running at less than 2 percent nationally. They peaked at nearly 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.The late-payment rate in the April-June quarter improved in every state, with Arizona posting the biggest annual decline. The states mortgage delinquency rate was for the quarter was 3.6 percent, down about 42 percent from the second quarter last year.California, with a rate of 3.6 percent, and Colorado (2.3 percent) also had steep annual declines in the rate of late payments.Florida had the highest mortgage delinquency rate in the nation at nearly 9.9 percent, even though it declined about 27 percent from a year earlier.TransUnion, which draws its data from a sample of 27 million consumer records, anticipates the national mortgage delinquency rate will continue to decline in the third quarter, finishing below 4 percent."Were still a long way from what wed call normal," Martin said.	2013-08-06

But then the down-on-his-luck jeweler convinces the accountant to pass along private information about clients, and uses the insider information to play the stock market and win big. Bags of cash swap hands in alleys. Then the feds get wind of the scam. The jeweler turns states witness and amid a spiral of wire taps and surveillance photos, the mens reputations unravel and their mea culpas play out on a very public stage.ADVERTISEMENTOn Thursday, federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed criminal and civil charges against fired KPMG accounting partner Scott London for conspiracy to commit securities fraud through insider trading. The 24-page criminal affidavit alleges that London, 50, provided confidential information about KPMG audit clients Herbalife Ltd., Skechers USA Inc., Uggs maker Deckers Outdoor Corp., RSC Holdings and Pacific Capital to Bryan Shaw, a close friend, from late 2010 until last month. Prosecutors allege that Shaw made more than $1.2 million in illicit profits by trading in advance of company announcements on earnings results or mergers.The government alleges that on some occasions, London called Shaw two to three days before press releases were issued for KPMG clients and read confidential information from the draft releases to Shaw. London, who worked for KPMG for nearly 30 years, also disclosed confidential information about impending mergers concerning KPMG clients before that information was made public. He discussed how to structure Shaws purchases of the stock in certain companies in order to protect them from being discovered, according to the complaint.The governments complaint quotes Shaw as saying that he expressed concerns to London in late 2011 about trading ahead of RSC Holdings sale to United Rentals, but that London told him not to worry because regulators werent looking for "small fish."Shaw passed London "tens of thousands of dollars in cash" in bags over the years for the information, according to the government. London also received a $12,000 Rolex watch, as well as jewelry for his wife and concert tickets. Londons lawyer Harland Braun has said London received "about $25,000" over several years. The SEC puts the cash sum at at least $50,000.The scandal has unfolded in pieces this week. Late Monday KPMG announced that it fired a Los Angeles partner who leaked nonpublic information about companies that KPMG worked with. On Tuesday nutritional supplement maker Herbalife and shoe seller Skechers announced that they were the companies whose information was leaked. On Wednesday, London publicly identified himself through his lawyer and issued a statement saying that he deeply regretted his actions and was just trying to help a friend struggling after his family-run jewelry business began faltering in the economic downturn.Thursday brought one of the remaining pieces of the puzzle when Bryan Shaw identified himself as that friend. The two men had met at a country club several years earlier and became close friends and golfing partners.In a statement through his lawyer, Nathan Hochman, Shaw said he received information from London "about a number of companies" from 2010 to 2012. He said that he had "profited substantially" from trading stocks based on that information, but he didnt provide details."I cannot begin to apologize for my incredibly stupid actions," said Shaw. "There is no excuse for my wrongful conduct. I accept full and complete responsibility for what I have done and know that I will spend the rest of my life trying to make up for my tragic lapses of judgment."Hochman said Thursday that Shaw received a government subpoena several months ago and has been cooperating with the investigation. "As part of that cooperation, he agreed to make monitored phone calls with Mr. London, and have monitored meetings with him as well," Hochman said in a phone interview.London has said that he never leaked any documents, and has described the interactions as his friend asking whether a stock was a good buy and London offering suggestions.London made his first court appearance Thursday afternoon in Los Angeles and was released on $150,000 bond, with his wife putting up $50,000 in cash and the deed to their Agoura Hills, Calif., home. Braun said Thursday that London will plead guilty to the criminal charge when he next appears in court on May 17.London discovered that he was the target of an investigation when the FBI came to his home and showed London a picture of him accepting cash, Braun said. London then spoke with investigators for three hours, admitting his role. Braun said that his client came to him chiefly concerned about protecting KPMG from the scandals fallout. Braun maintains that Londons honesty in admitting his sole culpability "saved the country from a stock market crash" that could have ensued if investors, spooked by the prospect that KPMGs audits were widely tainted, started selling off stock in many companies.The SEC is seeking unspecified penalties and restitution against London and Shaw. The criminal charge against London carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison, and a fine of at least $250,000.__Special Correspondent Linda Deutsch reported from Los Angeles.

Results were boosted by a 6 percent increase in global sales at cafes open at least a year, a key metric of health.ADVERTISEMENTThe performance reflects the sharp turnaround Starbucks has made since its struggles during the recession. After bringing back founder Howard Schultz as CEO in 2008, the company embarked on a massive restructuring effort that included closing underperforming stores in the U.S. Going forward, Schultz has noted that the company has the flexibility to keep growing even through a turbulent economy because most people see Starbucks as an "affordable luxury."In the flagship Americas region, Starbucks said sales at stores open at least a rose 7 percent as the Pumpkin Spice Latte once again proved to be a hit. Customers are also buying more food, which helps drive up the amount they spend per visit. About a third of purchases currently include food and Starbucks is betting that its new baked goods — supplied from a San Francisco bakery it purchased last year — will continue to drive up that figure.Cliff Burrows, who heads the Americas region, said Starbucks will continue growing by improving the speed of service and relationships with customers. For example, baristas across the country should be wearing name tags by the end of this month. Sixty percent of new cafes in the U.S. will also have drive-thru service, which makes the stores more profitable.The introduction of the Verismo single-serve coffee machine in stores this fall also added 0.5 percent to the sales increase for the region. Starbucks said it sold more than 150,000 of the machines, most of them through specialty retailers. Executives said the machine will continue to be a major revenue driver in the coming months and years.Operating margin in the U.S. decreased slightly to 20.8 percent, however, as a result of costs related to Superstorm Sandy, litigation charges and the companys leadership conference this past October.In the China and Asia Pacific region, which is set to surpass Canada as Starbucks second biggest market in the next two years, sales at cafes open at least a year rose 11 percent as traffic increased.Europe continued to be a weak spot, with sales at cafes open a year falling 1 percent. Starbucks executives have said theyre working to turnaround their performance in the region, in part by closing underperforming stores, licensing operations to local partners and improving customer service. Although traffic increased in Europe during the period, the amount people spent per visit declined.Troy Alstead, the companys chief financial officer, said the decline reflected weakness in the broader economy."A lot of people were trading down it appears," said Troy Alstead, the companys chief financial officer, noting that fewer purchases included food.Starbucks also has been embroiled in a controversy over its taxes in the United Kingdom. The company has been doing business in Britain for 15 years but hadnt paid any taxes because of a complex way it calculates profits. Following criticism by lawmakers and a campaign by a protest group, Starbucks said last month that it was working to settle the issue.For October-to-December period, Starbucks Corp. earned $432.2 million, or 57 cents per share. Thats compared with $382.1 million, or 50 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Total revenue rose 11 percent to $3.8 billion. Analysts expected a profit of 57 cents per share on revenue of $3.85 billion, according to FactSet.Revenue for the consumer packaged goods segment, which includes Verismos sold in specialty stores, rose 16 percent to $459.8 million. Although Starbucks is working to diversify by building this segment, it still represents a small fraction of the companys overall revenue.Starbucks affirmed its outlook for the year, with earnings expected to be between $2.096 and $2.15 per share, representing growth of 15 to 20 percent from the previous year.Its stock was up 24 cents at $54.81. Starbucks has about 18,000 cafes around the world.___Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi	2013-01-24

"Now I gotta go home and cook."At a Target store in Brooklyn, N.Y., about 25 people were waiting in line at 2:50 p.m. for the 8 p.m. opening, an hour earlier than a year ago.Theresa Alcantaro, 35, a crossing guard, was waiting with her 12-year-old son to buy an Xbox One. It wasnt on sale, but supplies have been scarce. She was missing a gathering of 40 family members but said she would meet up after shopping. She hoped to be in and out by 9 p.m."Honestly if I can get a good deal, I do not mind," she said about Thanksgiving day shopping. "I see my family every day. They understand."After shopping at Target and meeting up with her family, she plans to go back out again at midnight with family members but wasnt sure where yet.The holiday openings are a break with tradition. The day after Thanksgiving, called Black Friday, for a decade had been considered the official start to the holiday buying season. Its also typically the biggest shopping day of the year.But in the past few years, retailers have pushed opening times into Thanksgiving night. Theyve also pushed up discounting that used to be reserved for Black Friday into early November, which has led retail experts to question whether the Thanksgiving openings will steal some of Black Fridays thunder.In fact, Thanksgiving openings took a bite out of Black Friday sales last year: Sales on turkey day were $810 million last year, an increase of 55 percent from the previous year as more stores opened on the holiday, according to Chicago research firm ShopperTrak. But sales dropped 1.8 percent to $11.2 billion on Black Friday, though it still was the biggest shopping day last year."Black Friday is now Gray Friday," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consultancy. "Its been pulled all the way to the beginning of November."Stores are trying to get shoppers to buy in an economy thats still challenging. While the job and housing markets are improving, that hasnt yet translated into sustained spending increases among most shoppers.Overall, the National Retail Federation expects retail sales to be up 3.9 percent to $602.1 billion during the last two months of the year. Thats higher than last years 3.5 percent growth, but below the 6 percent pace seen before the recession.Analysts expect sales to be generated at the expense of profits as retailers will likely have to do more discounting to get people into stores. More than two dozen stores including Wal-Mart and Kohls have already lowered their profit outlooks for the year.Shoppers financial stress was apparent at the stores on Thursday."I struggle a lot," said Adriana Tavaraz, 51, from the Bronx who had spent $100 buying holiday decor for herself and her family on Thanksgiving at a Kmart in Manhattans Midtown section. "Nowadays, you have to think about what you spend. You have to think about tomorrow."Tavaraz, who works at a travel agency, started saving for holiday presents in June and planned to spend a total of $200 for holiday presents. She noted her holiday budget was tight because she was grappling with higher costs like food and monthly rent, which rose $100 to $1,700 this year.The Thanksgiving openings are part of retailers holiday strategy of trying to lure shoppers in early and often during the holiday shopping season. But the stores face challenges in doing that.Some workers have petitions on change.org to protest against Target and Best Buy. The Retail Action Project, a labor-backed group of retail workers, also is planning to have members visiting customers at stores including Gap and Victorias Secret in the Manhattan borough of New York City to educate them about the demands on workers.Wal-Mart has been the biggest target for protests against holiday hours. Most of the companys stores are open 24 hours, but the retailer is starting its sales events at 6 p.m. on Thursday, two hours earlier than last year.The issue is part of a broader campaign against the companys treatment of workers thats being waged by a union-backed group called OUR Walmart, which includes former and current workers. The group is staging demonstrations and walkouts at hundreds of stores around the country on Black Friday.Brooke Buchanan, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the discounter has received "really good feedback" from employees about working the holiday.Wal-Mart said workers get additional holiday pay for working on Thanksgiving. Wal-Mart is also serving meals at the stores and is giving employees a 25 percent discount on a single purchase.But Wal-Mart worker Cindy Murray, 57, shrugs off the perks and said she wont be able to sit down for a Thanksgiving meal with her family until after her nine-hour shift ends at 4 p.m. Murray says the company cant put a price on the holiday."If they want to do something for us, they will go back to the old tradition," said Murray, who lives in Hyettsville, Md.	2013-11-28

A suit would mark the first enforcement action by the federal government against a major rating agency over the issue.ADVERTISEMENTThe big rating agency denies any wrongdoing and says any lawsuit would be without factual or legal merit.A suit would "disregard" the fact that S&P reviewed the same data on risky mortgages as the rest of the market and U.S. government officials, who publicly said in 2007 that the problems in the subprime mortgage market appeared to be limited, the company said.In a statement, S&P said it "deeply regrets" that its ratings on the securities "failed to fully anticipate the rapidly deteriorating conditions in the U.S. mortgage market during that tumultuous time." However, the company said, it took "extensive" rating actions in 2007, before other rating agencies, on the mortgage-backed securities that were included in a mix of mortgage securities.Justice Department spokeswoman Nanda Chitre declined to comment on the matter.S&P is a unit of New York-based McGraw-Hill Cos. The companys stock was down 13 percent in heavy trading Monday amid a broader market decline.S&P and the other two major agencies, Moodys Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, have been blamed for helping fuel the crisis by giving AAA ratings to trillions of dollars in risky securities backed by subprime mortgages. The securities later sank in value when the housing market bubble burst and home-loan delinquencies soared, causing tens of billions of dollars in losses for major U.S. banks.The rating agencies are crucial financial gatekeepers. The grades they assign can affect a companys ability to raise or borrow money and how much investors will pay for securities it issues.The securities in the anticipated federal lawsuit are collateralized debt offerings, or CDOs. CDOs are securities that contain many underlying mortgage loans.A CDO generally gains in value if borrowers repay, but lose value if they default. Soured CDOs have been blamed for intensifying the financial crisis.Critics say rating agencies have an inherent conflict of interest: Theyre paid by the companies whose products and credit they rate. The agencies have been accused of issuing unduly high ratings before the crisis because of pressure from banks they wanted as clients.	2013-02-04

The declines indicate companies are confident enough about the economy to keep their staffs.Employers are also hiring more after harsh winter weather lowered job gains in January and December, the government said last week. The economy gained 175,000 jobs last month, up from just 129,000 in January and only 84,000 in December.The report "supports the idea that the labor market is still improving," said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at brokerage firm BTIG. "This is another unquestionable positive."About 3.45 million people received unemployment benefits as of Feb. 22, the latest figures available. Thats 13,000 more than the previous week.In a separate report Thursday, the Commerce Department said that sales at retail stores and restaurants rose 0.3 percent last month. The rebound suggests consumers are spending a bit more after sales fell a sharp 0.6 percent in January.The unemployment applications and retail sales suggest the economy is recovering after harsh winter weather caused auto sales to dip, factory orders to fall, and sales of existing homes to plummet.The unemployment rate ticked up last month to 6.7 percent from 6.6 percent, but the increase occurred partly for a good reason: more people started looking for jobs. Most werent immediately hired, boosting the unemployment rate. But the fact that they started job hunting suggests they were optimistic about their prospects.The weather did force about 6 million people with full-time jobs to work part-time in February. Many of their paychecks will shrink, likely weighing on spending.Thats one reason economists forecast growth will slow to an annual rate of 2 percent or less in the first three months of this year, down from 2.4 percent in the final three months of last year. But as the weather improves, most analysts expect growth to rebound to an annual rate near 3 percent.	2014-03-13

The Port Authority, which owned the World Trade Center towers and the land they sat on in lower Manhattan, is now among hundreds of entities around the world that pay to use the "World Trade Center" name.The WTCA didnt return a message seeking comment Friday.At the agencys monthly board meeting on September 18, Port Authority executive director Patrick Foye called the naming rights deal "a shameful episode" and vowed an internal investigation in tandem with the probe announced that day by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Neither Foye nor Port Authority board chairman David Samson was able to say who had approved the deal. The newspaper reported that the contract, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, bore the signature of a secretary. Foye said then-Port Authority executive director Stephen Berger told him he had not approved the deal.The Port Authority pays $10,000 a year to use the words "World Trade Center," including on merchandise it plans to sell in the new World Trade Center currently under construction. Those sales could bring the Port Authority an estimated $23 million to $28 million annually, the newspaper reported. In exchange for the Port Authoritys use of the trademark, the WTCA is requesting free office space at the new World Trade Center site worth an estimated $585,000 per year, according to documents obtained by the newspaper._____Gormley reported from Albany, N.Y.	2013-09-27

She already has heard from potential customers interested in renting ATVs for up to a week at a time and said she is looking forward to exposing them to the wildlife, agriculture and scenic beauty surrounding the trails."Its about getting people to see that ATV-ing is far more than just going out and messing around in the dirt. Its a family activity, and it can expose people to areas they otherwise would never experience," she said.The new trail system comes several years after the opening of Jericho Mountain State Park in Berlin, the states newest and the only one in New England developed for ATVs and snowmobiles. Building on that success, the state Legislature this year passed a pair of bills aimed at attracting more off-road vehicle enthusiasts to the state: One would allow the construction of a separate obstacle course for modified trucks and jeeps at the park, and the other would allow larger, two-passenger motorized vehicles on state-owned trails.In Maine, theres also been a push in recent years to promote nature-based tourism, in part to drive visitors to far-flung areas where tourism isnt as big as it is along much of the seacoast.Tourists are being lured to outer areas through attractions such as the Downeast Fisheries Trail in eastern Maine, which showcases the states maritime heritage; the Maine Huts and Trails network of trails and huts in western Maine; and a statewide bird-watching trail. Whitewater rafting, lakeside cottages and thousands of miles of trails for ATV riders and snowmobilers also have given rural regions economic boosts."The shift toward nature-based tourism is getting out into Washington County or Aroostook County," in far eastern and northern Maine, said Charlie Colgan, an economist at the University of Southern Maines Muskie School of Public Service."Its another geographic evolution from the 1880s, when Portland was selling itself as the gateway to what you escaped to out of Boston and New York," he said. "It was far away, but you could still get there."Building a nature-based tourism industry requires having reasonable amenities in accessible locations, he said. While some people want an Appalachian Trail-like experience where they can hike with a backpack and sleep in a tent, others want to go for hikes but also sleep in a bed and eat in a restaurant, he said."The good thing is theres a huge diversity of markets that serve nature-based tourism that Maines well-positioned to deal with," he said.In Vermont, this summer will bring a new addition to the nations oldest long-distance hiking trail, the 270-mile Long Trail that runs the spine of the Green Mountains and includes numerous huts and backcountry campsites along the route. After decades of planning and fundraising, crews will break ground on a 200-foot suspension footbridge over the Winooski River.The Green Mountain Club, which maintains the trail, has sought to establish a safe, appropriate and permanent route over the river since 1912, when it established the first stretch of the trail, said Dave Hardy, director of trail programs."Its a big deal," he said. "Weve been looking to relocate the trail and build this bridge since the beginning."With more than 200,000 people using the trail each year, hiking has become a major economic driver for the state, club officials said. The group also plans to repair the last stretch of the Long Trail and Appalachian Trail that were closed because of damage from the remnants from Hurricane Irene in 2011.And for those who dont want to pick just one state, all three states plus New York and parts of Canada are connected by the Northern Forest Canoe Trail, which links 740 miles of remote waterways.___Associated Press writer Clarke Canfield in Portland, Maine, contributed to this report.	2013-05-26

The companys sales force faced the highest number of cuts, while others are in customer service and editorial, the people paid to write up the deals. LivingSocial said it is moving its customer service operations to Tucson, Ariz., from Washington, where it has its headquarters.ADVERTISEMENTWeinstein said the job cuts came as part of a review of LivingSocials global operations. He said the review was designed to make sure that the company has the resources it needs to invest in areas that are "critical to the future," such as marketing and mobile.Over the past year or so, online deals have gone from fad to a much-copied business model thats easy to set up but difficult to sustain. LivingSocial is one of the largest of the online deals companies, behind No. 1 Groupon Inc.The job cuts came a day after Groupon CEO Andrew Mason said "it would be weird" if his board wasnt discussing whether he was the right person for the job amid the companys poor stock performance. His possible ouster was reported by AllThingsD and elsewhere.Groupons stock fell 2 cents to $4.40 in afternoon trading Thursday. The Chicago-based company went public in November 2011 at $20 per share. Earlier this month, Groupon reported a small loss for its third quarter. While its revenue grew by a third, it wasnt as high as Wall Street had hoped due largely to the weak economy in Europe.Groupons growth rate has steadily declined: In the fourth quarter of 2011, in its first earnings report as a public company, Groupon said its revenue nearly tripled. That fell to 89 percent in the first quarter of this year, 45 percent in the second quarter and 32 percent in the third.Amazon.com Inc. has a small stake in LivingSocial, which is a privately held company.	2012-11-29

The slowdown is a reminder that the job markets path back to full health will be uneven.The Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate dipped to 7.6 percent from 7.7 percent. While that is the lowest in four years, the rate fell only because more people stopped looking for work. The government counts people as unemployed only if they are actively looking for a job.ADVERTISEMENTThe weakness in March may signal that some companies were worried last month about steep government spending cuts that began on March 1.Marchs job gains were half the pace of the previous six months, when the economy added an average of 196,000 jobs a month.

New York City fast food workers plan a second job action day to press for higher wages.APNEW YORK –  Hundreds of fast food workers and supporters protested outside New York City restaurants Thursday to demand higher wages for their low-paying jobs, including about 60 at a midtown Wendys who chanted: "Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Minimum wage has got to go!"Linda Archer said she has worked at a nearby McDonalds for three years and makes $8 an hour. The protesters want fast food restaurants to pay $15 per hour, almost double the current statewide hourly average of $8.25. New York City has among the worlds most expensive rents.ADVERTISEMENT"Im asking for respect, Im asking for $15, Im asking for a union, Im asking for job security," she said.McDonalds said in a statement that it values and respects all the employees who work at its restaurants.The state Legislature last month voted to raise New Yorks hourly minimum wage of $7.25 to $9 by 2016.But Scott DeFife, an executive vice president for the National Restaurant Association, said Thursday, "Current city and state proposals aimed at increasing the minimum wage and mandating paid leave would have a cumulative effect of significantly increasing the cost of doing business in New York and restrict the ability of the industry to create jobs."DeFife released a statement saying, "The restaurant industry provides opportunities for millions of Americans, women and men from all backgrounds, to move up the ladder and succeed."The day of picket lines organized by a coalition of unions and community groups followed a similar job action last November. Organizers said they expected hundreds of workers to demonstrate Thursday at dozens of fast food establishments, including McDonalds, Dominos, Wendys and Pizza Hut.Fast food workers deserve union representation, said Richard Trumka, national president of the AFL-CIO, who stopped by the Wendys protest."Theyre being mistreated, theyre being underpaid, theyre going to stand together until they get fair treatment and were going to stand with them," Trumka said.Shahnaz Perveen ate her lunch inside Wendys while protesters marched outside but said she supported the workers demands. "They work really hard," she said.Thursdays action also commemorated the assassination 45 years ago of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Tenn., where he was supporting a strike by sanitation workers.Several pickets wore signs that said "I am a man" or "I am a woman," echoing placards carried in Memphis in 1968.	2013-04-04

The amount is based on a five-year rolling average of the $47 billion Alaska Permanent Funds investment earnings.This years average includes 2009, a recession year when the fund posted a $2.5 billion net loss in statutory net income.Last years dividend was $878 per person, the lowest since 2005.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. APs earlier story is below.While the economy continues to recover, the worst of the recession will be very much felt by Alaskans Wednesday when the amount of their annual check from the states oil-wealth fund is announced.The amount of each persons dividend is based on a five-year rolling average of worldwide investment markets that were hard-hit far outside Alaska. This year, the calculation means the checks likely wont amount to much, certainly nowhere near the record payout of $2,069 in 2008.But hey, its still free money just for living in the northernmost state.Whatever the amount, most dividends will go as usual toward new toys, travel, college savings or paying debts. The announcement is an eagerly anticipated event that will take place with much fanfare in Anchorage.In the Inupiat Eskimo village of Deering, tribal administrator Dolores Iyatunguk said her dividend is going toward credit card bills and student loans. In the tiny village 520 miles northwest of Anchorage, the cost of living can be prohibitive, with diesel fuel currently $6.50 a gallon, for example. Iyatunguk isnt alone in using the money for necessities, although a small gift to herself would be nice."I was thinking about getting a winter jacket," she said. "But that can probably wait."The dividends are distributed annually to residents who have lived in Alaska for at least one calendar year. The amount based on a five-year average of the $47 billion Alaska Permanent Funds investment earnings, so this years average includes 2009, a recession year when the fund posted a $2.5 billion net loss in statutory net income.Alaska wasnt as hurt by the recession, but the Permanent Fund Corp. has a diversified portfolio, and it took a beating when markets plunged in the U.S and worldwide.State officials have said that as long as 2009 is part of the five-year calculation, the amount will be on the lower end. After this year, 2009 will drop from the equation.Last years dividend was $878, the lowest amount since 2005 and the ninth-lowest in the program that began more than three decades ago. The 2011 dividend was $1,174.The Permanent Fund was established in 1976 after North Slope oil was discovered. The state began distributing money from the fund to residents in 1982.Alaska has no state income tax, but residents must pay federal taxes on the bounty.Every year around payout time, many residents are in the market for a new snowmobile, particularly among rural residents looking for a good deal. People have been calling the Polaris and Arctic Cat store in the Anchorage suburb of Eagle River asking what kinds of dividend deals are in the works, said employee Doug Bestry.For many, the extra money is a way to offset higher prices in Alaska for items such as groceries. For Bestry, the money usually goes toward a splurge, although one year he used his dividend to pay off his pickup truck. Last year, he used it to visit his mother in Arizona, and hell probably do that again."Its just fun money for me," he said.___Follow Rachel DOro at https://twitter.com/rdoro.	2013-09-18

Bankruptcy could mean laying off employees, selling off assets, raising fees and scaling back basic services such as trash collection and snow plowing, which have already been slashed.Kevin Frederick, an admissions representative for a local career training school, called the step "an embarrassment.""I guess we have to take a couple of steps backward to move forward," Frederick said.Now city and state leaders must confront the challenge of rebuilding Detroits broken budget in as little as a year.Kevyn Orr, a bankruptcy expert hired by the state in March to stop Detroits fiscal free-fall, said Detroit would continue paying its bills and employees.But, said Michael Sweet, a bankruptcy attorney in Fox-Rothschilds San Francisco office, "they dont have to pay anyone they dont want to. And no one can sue them."The citys woes have piled up for generations. In the 1950s, its population grew to 1.8 million people, many of whom were lured by plentiful, well-paying auto jobs. Later that decade, Detroit began to decline as developers starting building suburbs that lured away workers and businesses.Then beginning in the late 1960s, auto companies began opening plants in other cities. Property values and tax revenue fell, and police couldnt control crime. In later years, the rise of autos imported from Japan started to cut the size of the U.S. auto industry.By the time the auto industry melted down in 2009, only a few factories from GM and Chrysler were left. GM is the only one with headquarters in Detroit, though it has huge research and testing centers with thousands of jobs outside the city.Detroit lost a quarter-million residents between 2000 and 2010. Today, the population struggles to stay above 700,000.The result is a metropolis where whole neighborhoods are practically deserted and basic services cut off in places. Looming over the crumbling landscape is a budget deficit believed to be more than $380 million and long-term debt that could be as much as $20 billion.In recent months, the city has relied on state-backed bond money to meet payroll for its 10,000 employees.Orr made the filing in federal bankruptcy court under Chapter 9, the bankruptcy system for cities and counties.He was unable to persuade a host of creditors, unions and pension boards to take pennies on the dollar to help with the citys massive financial restructuring. If the bankruptcy filing is approved, city assets could be liquidated to satisfy demands for payment.Orr said Thursday that he "bent over backward" to work with creditors, rejecting criticism that he was too rigid. "Anybody who takes that position just hasnt been listening."The bankruptcy could last through summer or fall 2014, which coincides with the end of Orrs 18-month appointment, he said.Gov. Rick Snyder, who called bankruptcy the "one feasible path," determined earlier this year that Detroit was in a financial emergency and without a plan for improvement. He made it the largest U.S. city to fall under state oversight when a state loan board hired Orr.Creditors and public servants "deserve to know what promises the city can and will keep," Snyder wrote in a letter that was part of the filing. "The only way to do those things is to radically restructure the city and allow it to reinvent itself without the burden of impossible obligations."A turnaround specialist, Orr represented automaker Chrysler LLC during its successful restructuring. He issued a warning early on in his tenure in Detroit that bankruptcy was a road he preferred to avoid.Some city workers and retirement systems filed lawsuits to prevent Snyder from approving Orrs bankruptcy request, said Detroit-area turnaround specialist James McTevia.They have argued that bankruptcy could change pension and retiree benefits, which are guaranteed under state law.Others are concerned that a bankrupt Detroit will cause businesses large and small to reconsider their operations in the city. But General Motors does not anticipate any impact to its daily operations, the automaker said Thursday in a statement.Detroit has more than double the population of the Northern California community of Stockton, Calif., which until Detroit had been the largest U.S. city ever to file for bankruptcy when it did so in June 2012.Before Detroit, the largest municipal bankruptcy filing had involved Jefferson County, Ala., which was more than $4 billion in debt when it filed in 2011. Another recent city to have filed for bankruptcy was San Bernardino, Calif., which took that route in August 2012 after learning it had a $46 million deficit.	2013-07-19

Patrick meets with critics of new tech tax, no decisions made	BOSTON –  Gov. Deval Patrick and legislative leaders met with business leaders on Wednesday to discuss opposition to a new state sales tax on computer and software services, but no immediate decisions were made on the future of the tax.The measure, approved last month as part of a transportation financing plan, has drawn sharp criticism from technology companies. They have called the so-called tech tax vague and confusing, while warning it could harm a key sector of the states economy and cost jobs.ADVERTISEMENTPatrick convened the closed-door meeting in his office after business-backed groups, including the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, announced they would ask Massachusetts voters to repeal the tax if lawmakers did not do so first.Michael Widmer, president of the foundation, said Patrick, House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Senate President Therese Murray listened to the arguments during the session, but made no promises."It raised awareness among political leaders that this tax is unfixable and needs to be repealed," Widmer said of the meeting.The tax was estimated to produce $161 million in the current fiscal year, and Widmer said business leaders acknowledged that removing that revenue would leave a hole in the state budget. Patrick and top lawmakers have insisted that any change in the tax would have to be replaced by another, equivalent source of revenue.The governors office originally said Patrick would speak at the conclusion the meeting, but when reporters gathered outside his office they were told he would have no immediate comment. An aide called the mix-up a "misunderstanding."In a written statement issued later in the day, Patrick said he had a "constructive and robust conversation" with the industry leaders and lawmakers over both the issues surrounding the tax and the need to fund improvements in the states transportation system."While we did not arrive at a solution, we all committed to seeking one together over the next few weeks," the governor said.Patrick had previously pointed to efforts by his administration to narrow the scope of the 6.25 percent sales tax on software services. For example, the Revenue Department ruled that modifications or enhancements made to open source software, which is generally free and downloadable on the Internet, would not be subject to the tax.DeLeo and Murray issued a joint statement calling Wednesdays discussion thoughtful and informative, and promising to hold further conversations with members of the House and Senate. At least one repeal bill has already been filed and Republican lawmakers have said they would push strongly to eliminate the tax.In a separate development, Attorney General Martha Coakley certified on Wednesday that a proposed ballot question filed by business groups to repeal the tax was constitutional and could move forward. The question could appear on the November 2014 state ballot if lawmakers do not act in the interim.	2013-09-04

They expressed concern that the continued purchases could eventually escalate inflation, unsettle financial markets or cause the Fed to absorb losses once it begins selling its investment holdings.ADVERTISEMENTIn the end, the Fed voted last month to keep its bond program open-ended and at the same size. It said in a statement that the bond purchases would continue until the job market improved substantially.The January minutes suggested that the discussion over the risks from the bond purchases was more extensive than at the Feds December meeting. Minutes of the December meeting had also pointed to divisions among Fed officials over how long the purchases should continue. The debate within the Fed has fed speculation that the bond purchases might be scaled back or ended altogether this year.In January, the minutes showed that "several participants" thought the Fed should be ready to vary the pace of its purchases as it adjusts its view of the economy or the benefits and costs of the purchases. The policymakers asked Fed staffers to provide a deeper analysis at upcoming meetings of the issues raised in the discussion.The Fed is embarked on its third round of bond purchases. Unlike the previous rounds, the latest effort is open-ended: The Fed has said it will keep buying bonds until it sees substantial improvement in the job market. It also plans to keep a key short-term interest rate at a record low at least until the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. The rate is now 7.9 percent.The minutes noted that officials thought the economy was showing signs of modest improvement at the start of 2013. Policymakers observed that the job market had been improving gradually and that super-low interest rates had helped boost sales of autos and other consumer products.But Fed officials also cautioned that threats remained. They pointed to possible economic disruptions from budget debates in Washington, including the scheduled start of across-the-board spending cuts on March 1 — cuts that could slow the economys growth.	2013-02-20

It was the third straight weekly increase and the highest level since late November. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose to 354,250.ADVERTISEMENTA Labor Department spokesman says it can be difficult to seasonally adjust the figures during the Easter holiday because the timing of the holiday varies from year to year. Economists warned before the report that the data could be volatile.Applications are a proxy for layoffs. The recent increases could suggest that companies are cutting jobs, possibly because of steep government spending cuts that began on March 1. Other reports have pointed to that possible trend, although most economists have said that any reductions are likely temporary.The government will issue the March employment report Friday.Job growth has picked up in recent months. Employers added an average of 200,000 jobs per month from November through February. Thats nearly double the average from last spring.Stronger economic growth this year has spurred more hiring. A steady housing recovery has boosted home construction and prices. Higher home prices make Americans feel wealthier, which can spur more spending.In February, consumer spending rose by the most in five months. And consumer confidence improved in March from the previous month, according to a survey released last week by the University of Michigan.Two reports Wednesday, however, suggested companies may have grown more cautious last month. Services companies grew in March but at a slower pace than in February, according to the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group. Service firms, which include retailers, hotels, restaurants and financial companies, cut back on hiring and a measure of new orders fell.And private employers added fewer jobs in March compared with February, according to payroll processor ADP. Construction firms didnt add any positions after three months of strong gains.Several economists lowered their forecasts for hiring in March after Wednesdays reports.

The Conference Board releases the Consumer Confidence Index for October on Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2013. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Americans confidence in the economy fell this month to the lowest level since April, as many worried about the impact of a 16-day partial government shutdown. The decline could weigh on spending and economic growth.The Conference Board said Tuesday that its index of consumer confidence dropped to 71.2 in October, down from 80.2 the previous month. Septembers figure was revised slightly higher.ADVERTISEMENTConsumers became particularly pessimistic in their outlook on the economy six months from now, while their assessment of current economic conditions declined by much less. They also expect less hiring in the months ahead. Consumers confidence is closely watched because their spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.Americans became more confident in the spring as job gains were healthy and economic growth improved. The Conference Boards measure reached 82.1 in June, the highest in 5 ½ years. Thats still below the reading of 90 that is consistent with a healthy economy.Confidence has dropped in three of the four months since June. The shutdown already caused a drop this month in the University of Michigans measure of consumer sentiment. Americans made more negative references to the federal governments impact on the economy in October than at any time in the 50-year history of the survey, the university said.Falling confidence can cause Americans to spend less, which would slow the economic growth. But sometimes consumers spend more, even when they say they are less confident.Weaker job growth is also weighing on consumers outlook. Employers added an average of just 143,000 jobs a month from July through September. Thats down from 182,000 a month in April through June and 207,000 in the first three months of the year.Sluggish spending is likely to weigh on economic growth. Most economists predict growth slowed in the July-September quarter to an annual rate of about 1.5 percent to 2 percent, down from a 2.5 percent rate in the April-June quarter. And the shutdown is likely to keep growth at a tepid pace for the final three months of the year.	2013-10-29

The study also finds that 49 states have seen an increase in the number of families living in poverty and 45 states have seen household median incomes fall in the last year. The dour report underscores the challenges young adults face now and foretell challenges they are likely to face as they get older.AP/FileWASHINGTON –  Almost 6 million young people are neither in school nor working, according to a study released Monday.Thats almost 15 percent of those aged 16 to 24 who have neither desk nor job, according to The Opportunity Nation coalition, which wrote the report.ADVERTISEMENTOther studies have shown that idle young adults are missing out on a window to build skills they will need later in life or use the knowledge they acquired in college. Without those experiences, they are less likely to command higher salaries and more likely to be an economic drain on their communities."This is not a group that we can write off. They just need a chance," said Mark Edwards, executive director of the coalition of businesses, advocacy groups, policy experts and nonprofit organizations dedicated to increasing economic mobility. "The tendency is to see them as lost souls and see them as unsavable. They are not."But changing the dynamic is not going to be easy.The coalition also finds that 49 states have seen an increase in the number of families living in poverty and 45 states have seen household median incomes fall in the last year. The dour report underscores the challenges young adults face now and foretell challenges they are likely to face as they get older.A young persons community is often closely tied to his or her success. The Opportunity Nation report tracked 16 factors — Internet access, college graduation rates, income inequality and public safety among them — and identified states that were doing well for its young people.Topping the list of supportive states are Vermont, Minnesota and North Dakota. At the bottom? Nevada, Mississippi and New Mexico."Their destiny is too often determined by their ZIP code," said Charlie Mangiardi, who works with Year Up, a nonprofit that trains young adults for careers and helps them find jobs."We have the supply. We dont have a lack of young people who need this opportunity," Mangiardi added.Just look at some of the nations largest cities. Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Miami, Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Riverside, Calif., all have more than 100,000 idle youth, the Opportunity Nation report found."Often times they lack the social capital in life," Mangiardi said. "Theres a whole pool of talent that is motivated, loyal and hardworking." They just cant get through an employers door, he added.Thats why Year Up spends a year working with high school graduates to teach them career skills such as computer programming or equipment repair they can use when the program ends. It also includes life coaching so they can learn skills such as time management. More than 4,500 young adults from urban areas have completed the program and 84 percent of them have found work.But its a far tougher time for other young people.In Mississippi and West Virginia, 1 in 5 young people are idle — higher than their older neighbors. Mississippi has an overall unemployment rate of 8 percent, while West Virginia posts about 7 percent. Like most states, they saw their unemployment rate fall since 2011, but researchers caution that shift could come from fewer residents looking for work and from more who had simply given up their search for jobs.And its not as though the challenges emerge from nowhere. Quality early childhood programs help students from poor families overcome societal hurdles, and on-time high school graduation rates often follow quality schools — other factors Opportunity Nation examined in its report."A lot of times we dont want to look at data because we dont want to be depressed," said Rob Denson, president of Des Moines Area Community College in Iowa.But its an uncomfortable reality that needs to be addressed, he said.Using previous years reports from Opportunity Nation, Denson helped rally community organizations in his city to develop a pilot program to help students as young as 14 find summer work."When we got the index, it really allowed us to use it as a rallying point for all of the community-based organizations we work with to say, Look, this is what the world sees when they look at Iowa," he said.Starting next summer, Des Moines students will be placed in paying jobs, part of a citywide collaboration to help its urban communities. It will help older adults, as well, because crime rates are expected to fall, he said."If theyre not in school or at work," Denson said, "theyre not usually doing something positive."	2013-10-21

Among those bucking that trend: Arkansas, Maryland, Washington and Pennsylvania.All told, lenders repossessed 43,597 homes last month, the lowest level since September 2007.At the current monthly pace, completed foreclosures will total roughly 550,000 this year, down from 671,000 last year, RealtyTrac said.An uptick in homes that entered the foreclosure process last month, however, may end up pushing that total to 600,000, said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac.Several factors are contributing to the decline in completed foreclosures: Steady job growth and ultra-low mortgage rates are helping the once-battered housing market recover, driving demand for homes and prices upward.Higher home values help restore equity to homeowners, which can help those at risk of foreclosure by improving their chances of refinancing their mortgage to a lower payment or place them in a better position to sell their home.Meanwhile, states like California, Nevada and others have passed laws to increase homeowners protections from foreclosure. Those laws have effectively delayed the pace of homes entering the foreclosure process, which has helped to thin the pipeline of completed foreclosures in those states.Even so, the number of foreclosure starts, or homes that entered the foreclosure process, edged higher for the second month in a row in March.Foreclosure starts rose 2 percent from February to 73,113. Thats still down 28 percent from March last year, the firm said.Twelve states, including New York, Maryland and Washington saw annual increases in foreclosure starts last month.During the housing downturn, about half of the homes that entered the foreclosure process ended up as bank-owned homes that could potentially to be sold at a sharp discount, hurting the value of nearby homes.But with the housing market apparently on a sustained, if gradual, turnaround path, its more likely that a home entering the foreclosure process now will be able to avoid being lost to foreclosure, Blomquist said."A lot of these wont end up as vacant bank-owned homes, dragging down the market," he said. "These foreclosures are happening in the context of a housing market thats recovering. Theyre not a sign that the housing market is going downhill again."As of end of March there were about 1.5 million U.S. homes in some stage of foreclosure, with 623,697 owned by lenders, according to RealtyTrac. Thats down from a peak of 2.2 million in December 2010.Most of the homes on the foreclosure path have loans that were made during the housing boom years and early into the downturn.As of December, 75 percent of homes in some stage of foreclosure have loans that were originated between 2003 and 2008, while 11 percent were made before 2003. Only 14 percent of the loans were made after 2009, the firm said.The latest data show homes that do complete the foreclosure process are taking longer to do so.On average, homes that completed the foreclosure process in the first three months of the year took an average of 477 days to do so, up from an average of 370 days in the same period last year, RealtyTrac said.New York ranked as the state with the longest foreclosure timeline at 1,049 days, or just under three years.Texas registered the fastest foreclosure process, taking an average of 159 days, the firm said.	2013-04-11

WASHINGTON –  Hiring went into a deep freeze this winter as harsh weather slowed the economy. A warmer March has raised a key question for Fridays monthly jobs report: Did hiring rebound in March along with the temperatures?Most economists think it did.ADVERTISEMENTBut some of the pickup in hiring will likely reflect a temporary bounce-back from the cold winter months. It may not be immediately clear how much of the job growth will endure.Analysts forecast that employers added 195,000 jobs last month, according to a survey by FactSet. That would be the highest total in four months and up from 175,000 in February. The unemployment rate is predicted to fall to 6.6 percent from 6.7 percent in February.Low temperatures and heavy snowstorms this winter closed factories, interrupted work at construction sites and kept consumers away from shopping malls. Hiring fell to an average of 129,000 jobs a month from December through February. That was sharply lower than the average of 225,000 in the previous three months.Some economists project that a much larger job gain took place last month. Thats largely because they think some hiring was delayed until March by the cold weather in January and February, thereby boosting Marchs job growth.Drew Matus, an economist at UBS, predicts that employers added 250,000 jobs last month, though he thinks 50,000 to 75,000 of that total will reflect delayed hiring from previous months."Theres more uncertainty around this number than usual," Matus said.Leaving aside the weather effect, economists generally expect hiring to average about 200,000 jobs a month for the rest of the year. Hiring at that pace should lower the unemployment rate and support steady growth.Most recent economic data suggest that the economy is picking up from the winter freeze.Auto sales jumped 6 percent last month to 1.5 million, the most since November. That was a sign that Americans remain willing to spend on big purchases.And surveys by the Institute for Supply Management, a group of purchasing managers, showed that both manufacturing and service companies expanded at a faster pace in March. Factories cranked out more goods and received slightly more orders, a good sign for future production. Service companies also received more orders.Manufacturers added jobs, the ISM found, though at a slower pace than in February. But service firms, including hotels, restaurants, retailers and financial companies, sharply ramped up hiring in March. That mostly reversed a steep fall the previous month.The number of Americans seeking unemployment aid rose last week but remained close to pre-recession levels. The four-week average of applications, a less volatile measure, stayed near a six-month low. That means companies are cutting fewer workers and might be hiring more.Home sales and construction, however, have been weak in recent months. Sales of existing homes have fallen in six out of the past seven months. Cold weather has likely caused some of the decline. But higher mortgage rates, rising prices and a limited supply of available homes have also held back sales.Many economists think growth slowed to a 1.5 percent to 2 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter, down from a 2.6 percent pace in last years fourth quarter. But most also forecast that steady hiring and less drag from government spending cuts should lift growth to nearly a 3 percent annual pace for the rest of the year.	2014-04-04

After the 2011 Japan disaster, tsunami waves surged across Pacific and damaged the Northern California commercial fishing village of Crescent City.Scientists say a closer offshore quake would create more havoc, flooding the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, forcing coastal communities to evacuate and destroying boats and small craft.The tsunami scenario is similar to a quake exercise released several years ago designed to prepare for a big one on the San Andreas Fault.	2013-09-04

That could be an indication that businesses are becoming more confident.Factory orders dipped 0.7 percent in January, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. That followed an even bigger 2 percent decline December, which was a larger decrease than first reported and the biggest decline since July. The weakness in both months was led by large declines in demand for commercial aircraft.ADVERTISEMENTOrders for core capital goods, a proxy for business investment, rose 1.5 percent in January, recovering after a 1.6 percent drop in December.Demand for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, were down 1 percent in January while non-durable goods orders slipped 0.4 percent.The estimate for durable goods was unchanged from a preliminary report. The weakness reflected a 20.2 percent plunge in orders for commercial aircraft, a drop that followed an even bigger 22.3 percent fall in December. Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 0.9 percent, the second straight decline. Analysts say weakness in this area will be reversed given expectations for continued gains in new car sales.Orders for primary metals such as iron, steel and aluminum, dropped 1.2 percent while demand for machinery was down 0.7 percent and computer orders fell 46 percent.Many economists say that manufacturing has gone through a soft patch but will be emerging to stronger growth in coming months.That expectation is based on the view that the overall economy, after slowing in the final three months of last year and the first quarter this year, will rebound to stronger growth. Many economists are forecasting that the economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, could expand at an annual rate of around 3 percent in 2014, up significantly from last years 1.9 percent gain.Last year, growth was held back by higher taxes which dampened consumer demand and across-the-board spending cuts by the federal government. It is estimated those two factors cut growth by about 1.5 percentage points. However, those adverse impacts are now waning. With the labor market expected to keep expanding, the hope is that growth will reach the fastest pace since before the 2007-2009 recession.The Institute for Supply Management, a group of purchasing managers, reported Monday that its closely watched manufacturing gauge rose to 53.2 in February, up from 51.3 in January.The increase only partly reversed a five-point drop in January, but economists were encouraged that the direction was positive. Any reading above 50 indicates manufacturing is expanding.For February, the index rose in part because of an increase in both new and backlogged orders. There was strength in other areas as well. Four of the 18 industries that are tracked by the survey reported growth.	2014-03-06

Experts say its time for owners to think about taking some risks and to make sure that they are taking care of employees.ADVERTISEMENTTheres evidence that owners are more confident. Nearly half of small business owners say there will be growth opportunities in the coming year, according to a survey taken in June and July by the National Small Business Association. Thats up from 38 percent six months ago. And the Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index of small business confidence, compiled from a July survey of owners, jumped 9 points to 25 from the start of the year.Of course, the economy still has soft spots, including manufacturing and sales of new homes, which fell sharply in July. And many owners are uneasy because they dont know what health insurance will cost under the Affordable Care Act.But owners shouldnt give into uncertainty, says Paul Sarvadi, an adviser to many small business owners."I wouldnt let the negative news and negative backdrop rob you of that innate risk-taking advantage and edge that you have," says Sarvadi, CEO of Insperity, a Houston-based human resources provider.Heres a look what small business owners should be doing right now:LOOK AHEADOwners should take a break from the day-to-day grind and think about the future."Back away from the business and look strategically at next year and ask, what can I do differently?" Sarvadi says. "Look at your (business) plan. Are you going to beat it or be behind it?"Owners should think about how they get their sales."You have to aggressively make sure you have your best foot forward on every sale, especially those most likely to come in," he says.Keeping costs down should remain a priority because customers are willing to bolt to another business that offers lower prices, says David Rosenbaum, president of Real-Time Computer Services, a technology services company based in New York."You need to be putting an additional emphasis on figuring out how to less expensively deliver what product or service youre delivering," Rosenbaum adds. "You may not be able to charge what you did before."Owners also need to help customers understand that their products and services are more valuable than what competitors offer."They have to figure out ways to communicate that theyre different," Rosenbaum says.Owners should take an honest, hard look at their companies and see if there are fundamental changes to make, recommends Kathleen Allen, a professor of entrepreneurship at the University of Southern Californias Marshall School of Business."You need to really analyze your business and say, what are the products or services Im selling that are doing well? What are the ones that are not? And can I substitute them with something else?" she says.THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND (SORT OF)This is the time to take risk.Surveys over the past year have shown that owners are playing it safe because of the economy. These days, many owners see hiring even one employee or investing in an expensive piece of equipment as risky. But that strategy isnt always the safest bet."To do nothing is to take a risk, and more often than not, its as great a risk as taking calculated action," says Dennis Ceru, an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass.Consumer spending and the economy can rebound quickly. Companies that cant jump on an opportunity because they dont have the staff or equipment may lose out to competitors."To be caught unaware and unprepared is as bad or worse as stepping into the pool before its up to temperature," Ceru says.Not moving forward because of uncertainty about the health care law is a mistake, USCs Allen says."They will not get all their questions answered for some time to come. Do you stand and wait for everything to be figured out before you do anything to grow your business?" she says.SHOW EMPLOYEES THAT YOU CAREAs the labor market improves, many people will look for new jobs. Retaining staffers is key, says Maria Martinez, owner of Respira Medical, a company that provides respiratory and other medical equipment.Martinez, who has 60 employees, uses incentives like flexible scheduling and tuition reimbursement to reward and keep staffers. They can come in late or leave early when necessary. She gives each employee four days a year with pay to volunteer at charitable organizations."It could be the simplest things that could make a difference," says Martinez, whose company is based in Linthicum Heights, Md.Martinez also believes in helping any employee whos struggling with personal or financial issues. She arranged for dental care for a staffer who couldnt afford it. The man never smiled because he was ashamed of his teeth, and when he got dentures, he began smiling at work for the first time. Martinez also fired a worker who belittled the man because of his teeth.Owners who had to cut 401(k) contributions or other benefits because of the recession and its aftermath should start restoring them, Insperitys Sarvadi says."I would consider, if not all at once, then incrementally bringing some things back," he says.	2013-08-28

One seller in North Carolina even set a price of $5,000 for a single Twinkie.“The news is out,” the listing reads. “Hostess Brands Inc. has filed for bankruptcy and has decided to end productions of their snack cakes.  This is your opportunity to own a piece of history, a delicious piece at that. You are bidding on a single Twinkies that will be protectively packaged and shipped to the winning bidder.”Sellers were also offering other Hostess icons, including a box of Ho Ho’s for $59.99, a Wonderbread golf ball for $5.99 and “one of the last boxes” of Hostess cupcakes for a whopping $100,000 despite their Nov. 27 expiration date.Another seller in Texas is asking an eye-popping $250,000 for one box of 10 Twinkies.“Item will be insured and picked up locally after payment in full,” the listing reads. “This is a great collectors [sic] item that can be passed down to family members and will only gain in value!”Hostess Brands Inc., the maker of iconic childhood treats including Ding Dongs, Wonder Bread and Drakes, announced Friday it will wind down its operations after struggling to keep up with rising labor costs and the ever-changing tastes of Americans, who have grown accustomed to a dizzying array of new snacks flooding supermarket aisles every year.The company, whose roster of brands date as far back as 1888, filed a motion to liquidate Friday with U.S. Bankruptcy Court after striking workers across the country crippled its ability to maintain production.Hostess CEO Greg Rayburn said in an interview that there was no buyer waiting in the wings to rescue the company. But without giving details, he said that there has been interest in some of its 30 brands, which include Dolly Madison and Natures Pride snacks. Experts agreed that it was likely the biggest brands would survive.The Associated Press contributed to this report.	2012-11-16

Leland Smith, CEO of SolidHires, during a job fair for veterans at the VFW Post 2681, in Marietta, Ga. The government reports on job openings and labor turnover for November on Friday, Jan. 17, 2014. (AP Photo/David Goldman, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  U.S. employers advertised more jobs in November and more Americans quit, positive signs for millions who are unemployed and looking for work.The Labor Department said Friday that job openings rose 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted 4 million, the most in 5 ½ years. And the number of people quitting increased 1.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted 2.4 million, a five-year high.ADVERTISEMENTJob openings havent topped 4 million since March 2008, just a few months after the Great Recession began. Openings at that level are generally consistent with a healthy job market.And more workers quitting can also be a positive signal, because people usually quit when they either have a new job — typically for more pay — or are confident they can find one.The data suggest the competition for jobs is getting a little bit easier. There were 2.7 unemployed workers for each available job in November, down from 6.7 just after the recession ended in July 2009. In a healthy economy the ratio is roughly 2 to 1.More job openings and quits suggest greater opportunities for the unemployed. But those positive trends havent recently translated into additional hiring. Overall hiring ticked up just 0.2 percent in November to nearly 4.5 million.The figures also follow a disappointing report on December job growth. The government last week said employers added just 74,000 jobs in December. Thats the fewest in three years and below an average gain of 214,000 in the previous three months.The unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent, the lowest in more than five years. But the rate dropped mostly because more Americans gave up looking for work. The government counts people as unemployed only if they are actively hunting for jobs.Last weeks employment report shows net payroll gains — the number of people hired minus those who were laid off, quit or retired. Fridays report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, provides more details.For example, it shows the overall number of people hired each month, rather than just the net gain. Total hires reached 4.6 million in September, a five-year high, but hiring has dipped since then.In the past year, the number of job openings has increased 5.6 percent. But total hiring is only 1.7 percent higher.Economists point to several reasons for the gap. Employers may not be offering sufficient pay and benefits to persuade more workers to take the jobs. They may also be pickier, believing they can find top-notch candidates with the unemployment rate still elevated.Many employers say they cant find enough qualified workers, particularly in high-skilled industries such as manufacturing and information technology.Both Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who will succeed Bernanke as chairman next month, have cited greater overall hiring and quits as key signs of the job markets improvement.	2014-01-17

But month-over-month price gains slowed in most markets, a sign that higher mortgage rates may weigh on the housing recovery.The Standard &Poors/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index slowed only marginally from Mays year-over-year gain of 12.2 percent, the fastest since March 2006. And all 20 cities posted gains from the previous month and compared with a year ago, according to the report released Tuesday.ADVERTISEMENTHome prices in Las Vegas soared 24.9 percent from a year earlier to lead all cities. Purchases by investors have helped drive that increase. Other cities hit hard by the housing bust also posted stunning gains in the past year. Prices have jumped 24.5 percent in San Francisco and nearly 20 percent in both Los Angeles and Phoenix.Still, 14 of the 20 cities posted smaller gains in June compared with May. Thats unusual considering June is the middle of the summer buying season.Steady job gains and low mortgage rates have encouraged more Americans to buy homes. And even as demand has risen, a limited number of homes have been available for sale. The combination has led to sharp prices gains.But mortgage rates have climbed more than a full percentage point since May. The increase has already slowed sales of new homes in July. And economists expect it could drag re-sales lower in August.A slowdown from the strong price gains in recent months isnt necessarily a bad thing, economists said. It may keep home prices from becoming unaffordable.Stan Humphries, chief economist at real estate data provider Zillow, said price gains will likely keep slowing in the coming months as investors make fewer purchases, mortgage rates rise further and more homes become available."This ongoing stabilization ... is happening, and its not the end of the world for the housing market," he said.The index covers roughly half of U.S. homes. It measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The June figures are the latest available. They are not adjusted for seasonal variations, so the monthly gains reflect more buying activity over the summer.The housing rebound that began last year has helped drive economic growth, boost Americans wealth and create more construction jobs.But mortgage rates began to rise after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke first signaled that the Fed might reduce its bond purchases later this year. The bond purchases have helped keep mortgage rates and other borrowing costs low.	2013-08-27

Novembers figure was revised up from 70.4. The December increase followed three months of declines.ADVERTISEMENTConsumer confidence is nearly back to where it was before the partial government shutdown in October. Steady job gains and a surging stock market have made Americans more optimistic about the economy and hiring both now and in the near future."The upbeat consumer mood bodes well for spending in 2014," said Michael Dolega, senior economist at TD Economics.Optimism about the job market is at a five-year high. That is a positive sign for a strong December jobs report, which will be released next week.Consumers confidence is closely watched because their spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.The confidence index has averaged 73.3 this year, according to economists at Barclays Capital, the highest since 2007. In 2009, when the economy was in recession for half the year, it averaged 45.2.But confidence remains below the five-year high of 82.1 reached in June. And thats still below the reading of 90 that is consistent with a healthy economy.The report suggests Americans are willing to spend more on large purchases. The percentage of Americans planning to buy a home in the next six months rose to the highest level since July. And the proportion of Americans planning to purchase a major appliance in the next six months rose in December from the previous month.The increase in plans buy a home is "very encouraging, leaving us hopeful that gradually rising interest rates will not derail the housing recovery," Dolega said.Americans increased their spending in November by the most in five months, led by big gains in auto purchases. While many retailers have reported disappointing holiday sales, consumers appear to be spending at car dealers and on utilities and other services.Better hiring is putting more money in more Americans wallets. Employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs a month in the past four months, a big improvement from the summer. Those gains have helped push the unemployment rate to 7 percent, a five-year low.There are some weak spots: Income rose at a slower pace than spending last month. That means Americans saved less to spend more. And existing home sales have fallen for three straight months, held back by higher prices and mortgage rates.Still, the economy expanded at a 4.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the best showing in nearly two years. The healthy gain largely reflected a jump in restocking, as companies built up their inventories. Thats unlikely to be repeated in the current quarter. But many economists have become more optimistic about the fourth quarter and expect growth will clock in at a solid 2.5 percent annual rate.	2013-12-31
804	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/02/14/realtytrac-california-leads-sharp-drop-in-us-homes-that-entered-foreclosure-in/	RealtyTrac: California leads sharp drop in US homes that entered foreclosure in January	LOS ANGELES –  The number of U.S. homes entering the foreclosure process fell in January to a level not seen since the peak of the housing boom, a consequence of a package of state laws aimed at stemming foreclosures that went into effect in California at the beginning of the year.So-called foreclosure starts — when a home with a mortgage gone unpaid is placed on a countdown clock to possible foreclosure — declined 28 percent nationally last month from January 2012, foreclosure listing firm RealtyTrac Inc. said Thursday.ADVERTISEMENTForeclosure starts also fell 11 percent from December, the firm said.The last time fewer homes entered the foreclosure process in a single month was June 2006, when the U.S. housing market was roaring and home values were rising — trends that helped homeowners avoid foreclosure.Januarys decline in foreclosure starts was most pronounced in California. The number of homes in the state that started on the path to foreclosure plunged 75 percent from a year earlier and sank 62 percent from December.As the nations most-populous state, California has seen a larger share of the fallout from the housing downturn that most states. Thats why the states sharp drop in foreclosure starts last month had such an outsized impact on the national figures.The package of laws that went into effect on Jan. 1 increased homeowners protections from foreclosure, effectively buying them more time to potentially avoid losing their homes.Among the provisions: Large lenders must provide a single point of contact for homeowners who want to negotiate loan modifications and are prohibited from foreclosing while they evaluate homeowners requests for alternatives. Homeowners also can sue lenders to stop foreclosures or seek monetary damages if the lender violates state law.That may help some homeowners stave off foreclosure entirely. Others, however, may not be able to avoid losing their home, just delay the process.Similar laws have gone into effect in states such as Nevada and Washington. And in each case, foreclosure starts declined sharply."Unfortunately, down the road, we usually see a boomerang effect as some of those delayed foreclosures come back and actually end up being foreclosed-upon," said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac.Blomquist anticipates that could happen at the end of the year or early 2014.Because foreclosures typically sell at a sharp discount to other homes, a delayed wave of California foreclosures could potentially bring down the value of nearby homes when they sell.Still, should housing demand and home prices continue to grow this year, the speed bumps along the foreclosure path enacted by the California legislature could give homeowners time to avoid foreclosure by enabling them to qualify for mortgage refinancing or sell their home.All told, 64,773 homes nationwide were placed on the path to foreclosure in January, RealtyTrac said.Some states, such as Arkansas, Washington and Nevada, saw big increases in foreclosure starts.Meanwhile, the number of homes scheduled to be auctioned climbed between December and January in 26 states and Washington D.C. In several of those states, including Florida, Illinois and Pennsylvania, scheduled foreclosure auctions were at 12-month highs or greater.Lenders also took possession of the fewest homes since February 2008 last month.Completed foreclosures totaled 50,453 in January, down 5 percent from December and a decline of 24 percent from January 2012, RealtyTrac said.Some states, however, continued to see a big increase in homes repossessed by banks last month. Among them: Maryland, where repossessions rose 50 percent from a year earlier, and Ohio, where completed foreclosures jumped 23 percent.Historically, about half of all homes that enter the foreclosure process end up being taken back by lenders.Blomquist forecasts that 600,000 homes will end up being repossessed by banks nationally this year. Last year, lenders took back 671,251 homes, down nearly 17 percent from 2011s total.	2013-02-14

(Fox News)Paramilitary armed guards, death threats, standoffs. It’s not what you might expect amid the peaceful greenery of northern Wisconsin, but it’s that greenery, and what lies below, that has led to an intense battle over land, water and jobs.It all began when a company called Gogebic Taconite, or G-Tac, got permission to test the soil in northern Wisconsin’s Penokee Hills area for minerals, including iron ore. The company eventually wants to carve a 4-mile open pit mine through the heavily wooded area.ADVERTISEMENTG-Tac has leased thousands of acres of land in Wisconsin’s Iron County, an area which is popular with hikers in the summer and snowmobilers in the winter. Terms of the lease still allow the public to access the area.Many of those who live in the economically depressed towns nearby said they support the company’s efforts and look forward to the potential for much-needed jobs and growth in the region. Dozens of signs are posted on lawns in the small city of Hurley with messages like “Mines mean jobs” and “Mining is our History” and “Say yes to mining.”But opponents worry mining activities will poison the water supply and ruin the wetlands. And Native Americans in the area claim the mining violates their treaty rights because it would interfere with hunting and fishing.“We certainly dont need a mine,” argued Frank Koehn, who runs the website SaveTheWatersEdge.com.“All that does is produce the same mess we have now, but when theyre done weve got piles of dust, poisoned streams; some streams will be obliterated, the ground water will no longer be protected,”  he said.Confrontations between the two sides have been violent and dramatic. Once G-Tac workers went out and began doing the testing, at least a dozen protesters wearing bandanas over their faces showed up ready for action. The showdown, which is filled with yelling and expletives, was recorded and posted on YouTube. One protester can be seen wrestling with a woman over her camera.  That protester was later arrested and charged with a felony. Others face trespassing charges.“These folks broke into our camp, they barricaded the roads so that law enforcement wouldnt be able to help us, they held the site for over a half hour, they attacked one of our workers, and they destroyed a bunch of our equipment, and they threatened our people with burning our homes down,” said G-Tac spokesman Bob Seitz.Gogebic Taconite brought in armed guards to protect the property and its employees. Both sides claim their lives have been threatened.Critics call the protesters “Eco terrorists.” Some environmentalists call them heroes, but the majority of opponents in the Penokee Hills area said they don’t support the anarchy of the activists who were caught on the YouTube video. All this has happened, and yet so far G-Tac has only been doing exploratory drilling, and gathering samples to send to the Department of Natural Resources, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Army Corps of Engineers. If results show the process is safe, Gogebic Taconite will be allowed to go ahead with its plans to construct a massive iron ore mine.- Bob Seitz, spokesman for company seeking to mine iron ore"If they (protesters) have the courage of their convictions and they believe in what they have been saying, they should want us out there finding this information, because theyll be able to use those facts to kill the mine," said G-Tac spokesman Bob Seitz.G-Tac officials claim the mining will not introduce chemicals to the earth. Instead, dirt will be removed, pulverized, run over magnets to remove the iron ore, then put safely back on the ground. Since the heavily-wooded area of the mining site is an actively managed forest, trees will be harvested, then replanted when the mining is done. Environmental activists said they are still concerned.“They’re basically saying to us trust us, but I don’t trust the politicians," said Koehn. “Theyve written the laws that govern mining.  The public trust doctrine in Wisconsin has been gutted to say the best, and the doctrine was all about water.”The Penokee Hills are the head waters of the Bad River watershed, which extends south into Lake Superior. Mining in the lush hills of the dairy state has a long history. The industry was prominent, not just in Wisconsin, but also in northern Minnesota and Michigan, as far back as the 19th century. In addition to logging, mining was the main source of revenue in the area up through the first half of the 20th century, with as many as 30 different companies exploring and digging for lead, zinc and iron ore.Many of the people who populate the small towns and cities in the upper Midwest states, such as Hurley, are descendents of miners. Even Wisconsin’s nickname,  Badgers, is derived from the name of the basic hillside homes miners frequently constructed, according to the Wisconsin Mining Association website. “My father worked in the mine," recalled Hurley Mayor Joseph Pinardi, who grew up in the area. Lots of my uncles worked in the mine. "My grandpa worked in the mine when he first moved over here from Italy.”Mining through those generations provided a vast amount of iron that were used to build tanks and weapons for World War I, World War II and for cars. But it all came to a halt in the 1960s when mining became financially impractical. When the jobs went away, so did many of the residents, and the economy suffered. With the prospect of a mining comeback, protesters have set up what they call a “Harvest Camp” in the area where they believe the headquarters for the operation will be located. The camp, which has housed anywhere from three to 30 people at different times, is set up deep in the woods of northern Wisconsin. The camp is stocked with cans of non-perishable food and tents of all sizes litter the landscape. Sleeping bags and blankets are strewn around. Some people said they have been living at the camp for months.Mel Gasper, a Native American tribal elder for The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe, manages the camp and promises to “keep troublemakers out.”Gasper said efforts to start a mine in the area will not just be dangerous, they may also be illegal.  Treaty rights prevent anything that gets in the way of the tribe hunting and fishing.  “They start messing with the Native American treaty rights, we take it to a pretty high extent” he said, and vowed that the battle would continue up to the highest court.“I think theres a knee-jerk reaction in Wisconsin to mining,” said Seitz. “We have effectively drilled mining out of Wisconsin, and now the reintroduction of mining scares some folks."Pinardi agreed.“We all need to live here yet, we all need to drink the water, weve got to breathe the air,” Pinardi said. “Were not trying to harm our own environment. If its not going to be safe, we want to know, too.”	2013-08-12

That followed an $11.9 billion gain in June.ADVERTISEMENTA measure of borrowing that includes credit card debt fell $1.8 billion in July following an even larger $3.7 billion decline in June. A category that includes auto loans and student loans increased $12.3 billion after an even larger $15.6 billion gain in June.The reduction in credit card debt suggests that consumers remain cautious about accumulating high-interest debt.

Thats down from sharp gains of 0.6 percent in the previous two months, which were driven by a spike in gas prices that has since receded.ADVERTISEMENTGas prices fell 0.6 percent last month. Food prices rose 0.2 percent, pushed higher by steep increases in milk and cheese costs.Excluding volatile food and gas, prices increased 0.2 percent last month.The cost of shelter, which includes rents, rose 0.3 percent, the most in more than four years. Rental vacancies have declined in recent months, pushing rents higher. Hotel costs also increased last month.Clothes and airline fares also rose last month. The price of new and used cars fell.Over the past 12 months, overall consumer prices have increased just 2.2 percent. Thats only slightly above the Federal Reserves inflation target of 2 percent."Inflationary pressures at the consumer level are modest," Steven Wood, an economist at Insight Economics, said in a note to clients.Mild inflation leaves consumers with more money to spend, which can boost economic growth. Lower inflation also makes it easier for the Fed to continue with its efforts to rekindle the economy. If the Fed were worried that prices are rising too fast, it might have to raise interest rates.Minutes of the Feds October meeting released Wednesday suggested policymakers could launch a new bond-buying program in December to spur job growth. The goal of the purchases would be to lower long-term interest rates to encourage more borrowing and spending.Gas prices rose sharply over the summer and into September, but have since come down. The average price for a gallon of gas nationwide was $3.44 on Wednesday, about 35 cents below last months level.The price of milk increased 0.9 percent last month, the most in more than a year. Cheese costs jumped 1 percent. Prices for bread, cereals, meat and chicken also increased.The increases suggest that this summers drought is starting to drive up prices at supermarkets and grocery stores. The drought damaged corn, soybeans and other crops. Corn and soybeans are used in animal feed, which pushes up the price of beef, chicken and pork.Corn is also used in many products found throughout the supermarket, from cereals to soft drinks to cosmetics.	2012-11-15

So did UPSs outlook for this year as the company took a cautious approach toward the global economy.ADVERTISEMENTUPS also forecast a "relatively flat" first quarter. Shares dropped 2 percent."Overall we still see 2013 as a slow-growth economy," Chairman and CEO D. Scott Davis said Thursday on a conference call with analysts.Davis said Europe was more stable than a year ago, and "in the U.S., I think we got off to a strong start in January." But, he added, "Were not banking on a robust economy."UPS is the worlds biggest package-delivery company and something of an economic bellwether. It operates fleets of trucks and planes that haul everything from trinkets to industrial equipment between companies and from businesses to consumers.The Atlanta-based company said it expects 2013 adjusted earnings of between $4.80 and $5.06 per share. That would be an increase of 6 percent to 12 percent over 2012, but less than the $5.13 per share that analysts expected. UPS said the first quarter would be fairly flat, hurt by one less business day than in 2012.UPS said that it lost $1.75 billion in the fourth quarter because of a $3 billion charge for pension liabilities, compared with a profit of $725 million a year earlier. Without the pension-accounting charge, UPS said that it would have earned $2.05 billion, or $1.32 per share.Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $1.38 per share, according to FactSet.Revenue rose 3 percent to $14.57 billion, beating analysts forecast of $14.48 billion.The company said that disruptions from Hurricane Sandy lowered earnings by 5 cents per share and money spent on the failed pursuit of Dutch delivery firm TNT Express NV cost another penny per share.UPS increased its plan for spending on buying back its own stock this year to $4 billion from $1.5 billion.Peter Nesvold, an analyst for Jefferies & Co., said investors expected the company to make a "substantial" increase in share repurchasing after the TNT deal fell apart and freed up cash.Standard & Poors analyst Jim Corridore said the stock buybacks would help protect UPS shares from falling.UPS said consumer spending on holiday shopping was less than expected, although it still carried a record 500 million packages, including nearly 28 million on the busiest day, Dec. 19.In January, UPS walked away from an agreement to buy TNT. It would have expanded UPS presence in Europe, but antitrust regulators there insisted on concessions that UPS considered too costly. Davis said Thursday that the company is still interested in acquisitions but probably nothing as big as TNT, which would have been UPS largest purchase ever.Shares fell $1.71, or 2.1 percent, to $79.52 in afternoon trading Thursday. That pushed the gain for the month of January back below 10 percent.	2013-01-31

Ward says economic growth will boost the railroads profits, once coal stabilizes.Ward and other CSX executives held a conference call with investors Wednesday — a day after reporting first-quarter profit of $459 million, or 45 cents per share. That beat Wall Streets expectations and topped last years $449 million profit, or 43 cents per share."The underlying strength of our business continues, even with the transition that is taking place in the domestic coal market," Ward said.CSX officials predict that domestic coal volumes will decline 5 to 10 percent this year because many utilities still have significant coal stockpiles to burn, but generally all the utilities CSX serves that can switch to natural gas have done so to take advantage of cheap natural gas.So the railroad expects coal demand to stabilize in 2014, because utilities still need to burn some coal to meet electricity demand.In the first quarter CSX coal revenue dropped 13 percent to $726 million.At the same time revenue from intermodal, chemical, automotive, construction and agricultural shipments grew nearly 3 percent to top $2.1 billion.CSX officials are optimistic the railroad will be able to increase the number of shipping containers and other merchandise it carries faster than the economy is growing.S&P Capital IQ analyst Kevin Kirkeby said CSX appears to be an attractive buy because of the positive outlook and relatively low share price compared to historical averages.CSX shares lost 77 cents, or 3.2 percent, to sell for $23.37 in afternoon trading Wednesday amid a broad market sell-off.The number of carloads of chemicals, crops, lumber, coal, grain and containers of imported goods that railroads carry offers clues about the health of the broader economy.Ward said he doesnt think there is anything on the horizon that could derail the slow economic growth happening now. He said there is still much pent-up demand for products and equipment because people and companies have been delaying purchases since the Great Recession.But Ward said the economy would benefit if politicians could agree on a financial plan for the nation."One thing that would accelerate it is if Washington, D.C., could agree on fiscal policy," Ward said.CSX operates over 21,000 miles of track in 23 eastern states and two Canadian provinces.CSX is the first major freight railroad to release first-quarter earnings. Union Pacific Corp. will release its first-quarter results on Thursday, and Norfolk Southern Corp. will follow next Tuesday.___Follow Josh Funk online at www.twitter.com/funkwrite___Online:CSX Corp.: www.csx.com	2013-04-17

Shiller, 67, is a professor at Yale University.Shiller, an economist famous for having warned against bubbles in technology stocks and housing, said he reacted with "disbelief" when he received the telephone call from the academy early Monday."A lot of people have told me they hoped I would win it, but Im aware there are so many other worthy people that I had discounted it, so I would say no, I did not expect it," he told reporters in Stockholm by telephone.Starting in the 1960s, Fama and others showed how difficult it is to predict stock prices in the short run, findings which changed market practice, for example with the emergence of index funds, the academy said.Two decades later, Shiller showed that there is more predictability in the long run in stock and bond markets, while Hansen developed a statistical method to test theories of asset pricing."These are three very different kinds of people and the thing that unites them all is asset pricing," says David Warsh, who tracks academic economists on his Economic Principals blog.American researchers have dominated the economics awards in recent years; the last time there was no American among the winners was in 1999.The Nobel committees have now announced all six of the annual $1.2 million awards for 2013.The economics award is not a Nobel Prize in the same sense as the medicine, chemistry, physics, literature and peace prizes, which were created by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1895. Swedens central bank added the economics prize in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel.This years Nobel science prizes awarded ground-breaking research on how molecules move around inside a cell, particle physics and computer modeling of chemical reactions. Canadian short-story writer Alice Munro won the Nobel Prize in literature and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.All awards will be presented to the winners amid royal pageantry on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobels death in 1896.	2013-10-14

The Labor Department reports on the number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits last week on Thursday, April 25, 2013. (AP Photo/Mike Groll)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  The number of Americans seeking unemployment aid fell last week to a seasonally adjusted 339,000, the second-lowest level in more than five years. The decline suggests hiring is improving from last months sluggish pace.Applications for unemployment benefits dropped by 16,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week average declined 4,500 to 357,500.ADVERTISEMENTApplications are a proxy for layoffs. When they decline, it signals that companies are cutting fewer jobs. Still, layoffs are only half of the equation. Businesses also need to be confident enough in the economic outlook to step up hiring.Economists were encouraged by the report, though some cautioned against reading too much into one weeks data."The downtrend in unemployment remains on track," said Jim OSullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.In March, employers added only 88,000 jobs. That was a sharp drop from the previous four months, when hiring averaged 220,000 per month.The unemployment rate fell to a four-year low of 7.6 percent from 7.7 percent in February. But the drop occurred because more people out of work stopped looking for jobs. The government doesnt count people as unemployed unless they are actively looking for work.Most economists expect hiring improved this month from Marchs low level. Some economists expect net job gains increased to about 150,000.A drop in layoffs can make those with jobs feel more confident about keeping them, even when unemployment is high. Layoffs fell in January to their lowest level in the 12 years that the government has tracked the data. When people feel secure in their jobs, they are more likely to spend money and add to economic growth.More than 5 million Americans received unemployment aid in the week ending April 6, the latest data available. That is about 80,000 fewer than the previous week. Some recipients may no longer receive benefits because they have found jobs. But many have used up all the benefits available to them.The economy is expected to have grown at a much quicker pace in the January-March quarter. Most economists forecast growth accelerated to an annual rate of more than 3 percent in the first quarter, up from just a 0.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter.But many analysts now expect growth is slowing in the April-June quarter, mostly because across-the-board government spending cuts that began on March 1. That may have made businesses nervous about adding jobs.	2013-04-25

(AP Photo/LM Otero, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  A private survey shows that U.S. companies added slightly more jobs in February than in the previous month, but harsh winter weather weighed on hiring for the third straight month.Payroll processor ADP said Wednesday that businesses added 139,000 jobs last month, up from only 127,000 in January. But Januarys figure was revised sharply lower from an original estimate of 175,000.ADVERTISEMENTThe data suggests that the governments jobs report for February, to be released Friday, will show only modest gains. Economists forecast it will show that employers added 145,000 jobs in February. That is below the average gains of nearly 205,000 jobs a month in the first 11 months of last year.The ADP numbers cover only private businesses and often diverge from the governments more comprehensive report. In January and December its initial figures were much higher than the official count. The Labor Department said employers added 113,000 jobs in January and just 75,000 in December.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodys Analytics which helped compile the report, said that hiring should rebound once the weather improves. Chilly temperatures and snowstorms caused many businesses to close last month and possibly delay hiring.Some companies also built up large stockpiles of goods in the second half of last year, which means they are likely ordering fewer products in the current quarter, slowing output."Theyre all temporary weights on growth, and we should see a pickup ... as we move into the spring and summer months," Zandi said.The unseasonably cold weather may have shaved 0.2 percentage points from the economys growth rate in the January-March quarter, according to economists at IHS Global Insight.Growth is likely to come in at a 2 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, Zandi said, down from 2.4 percent in the October-December quarter.___Contact Chris Rugaber at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber .	2014-03-05

(AP Photo/Chuck Burton, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Average U.S. rates for fixed mortgages barely changed this week, hovering near historically low levels.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average for the 30-year loan slipped to 4.51 percent from 4.53 percent last week. The average for the 15-year loan edged up to 3.56 percent from 3.55 percent.ADVERTISEMENTMortgage rates have risen more than a full percentage point since hitting record lows a year ago. The increase was driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve would reduce its $85 billion a month in bond purchases.Last month, the Fed determined the economy was strong enough to start cutting those monthly purchases by $10 billion. The bond purchases have kept long-term interest rates low.The rise in mortgage rates has slowed home sales, which have fallen for three straight months.But overall, 2013 represented the best year for the housing market since the financial crisis. Sales of existing homes should reach 5.1 million for last year, the National Association of Realtors forecasts. That would be up 10 percent from the previous year and the most since 2006. Its still below the 5.5 million generally associated with healthy housing markets.Most economists expect sales and prices to keep rising this year, but at a slower pace. They forecast sales and prices will likely rise around 5 percent, down from double-digit gains in 2013.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for a 30-year mortgage declined to 0.7 point from 0.8 point. The fee for a 15-year loan slipped to 0.6 point from 0.7 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage was unchanged at 2.56 percent. The fee stayed at 0.5 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage increased to 3.15 percent from 3.05 percent. The fee was unchanged at 0.4 point.	2014-01-09

But overall inflation remained mild.The Labor Department says the producer price index, which measures costs before they reach the consumer, rose 0.4 percent last month. That ends three straight months of falling wholesale prices.ADVERTISEMENTGas prices reversed recent declines and increased 2.2 percent last month. Home heating oil costs grew at the fastest pace in 10 months, while diesel fuel prices increased at the biggest clip in almost four years.Over the past 12 months, relatively low energy costs have kept inflation tame. Prices have risen a modest 1.2 percent in that period.Excluding volatile energy and food prices, wholesale costs increased 0.3 percent in December and 1.4 percent year over year.	2014-01-15

U.S. exports increased 1 percent to $182.6 billion, while imports grew 3.8 percent to $231.3 billion.ADVERTISEMENTU.S. exports to Europe, a region struggling with a prolonged debt crisis, fell 1.3 percent. The jump in imports was led by gains in shipments of cell phones, including Apples new iPhone.A wider trade deficit acts as a drag on U.S. growth. It typically means the U.S. is earning less on overseas sales while spending more on foreign products.	2013-01-11

More than $7 billion of that is by the Chinese, who are now the second largest foreign home purchasers after Canadians. Theyre buying high-end, multimillion-dollar homes from California to New York and paying cash.ADVERTISEMENT"Theyre probably the top 1 percent of the Mandarin speakers that are coming from China," said Brent Chang, a Coldwell Banker realtor in Southern California. "Theyre really the people who have their own businesses or maybe were part of the government."Some of these homes are specifically catered to Chinese buyers. Fox News visited a home listed at $8 million in Pasadena, Calif., that had two kitchens, the smaller one had ventilation for the cooking for aromatic or "stinky" foods like fish. It also has a lower level in-law suite and even a koi pond."People from China do a lot more business in their homes so they want their homes to really scream that theyve made it and theyre successful, " said Chang.The Chinese like the U.S. because their money goes further. In Shanghai, $2 million might only get you a two-bedroom condo."You get a huge bang for your buck, you get land, you get good schools, you get a safe environment,  nice community life, " said Linda Chang, a realtor who works with her son, Brent, in the San Marino and Pasadena areas of California.   Chang says while many other real estate markets have suffered, her area has flourished thanks to Chinese and other foreign buyers."Its been fantastic for the U.S. housing market because we have not suffered as other communities have," said the elder Chang. "In fact, our property values have increased."While some of the Chinese buyers live in the U.S. full or part-time, realtors estimate about 40 percent of the homes are for investments. Theyre snapping up houses in states hit hard by foreclosures such as Nevada and Florida. Some are buying two or three homes at a time.According to Shanghai magazine Hurun Report, mainland China has almost 1 million millionaires and nearly half of them say they want to invest in the United States. "Its a sign of their status," said Betty Chan, who deals with Chinese buyers in Las Vegas. "You can show off to your friends and family that I can buy something overseas, not everybody can do it."Chan continued: "Most Chinese like to own a Mercedes ... it doesnt matter whether a Mercedes is a good car or not. Its just showing their status in the community, so owning a foreign house is pretty much a prestigious status in China, so theyre proud to tell their friends: Hey, I own a house overseas." Buyers from China also invested almost $2 billion in commercial property in 2011, or quadruple what they spent several years ago.	2012-11-27

The Labor Department releases employment data for February, on Friday, March, 7, 2014. (AP Photo/LM Otero)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Brutal winter weather snarled traffic, canceled flights and cut power to homes and factories in February. Yet it didnt faze U.S. employers, who added 175,000 jobs, far more than the two previous months.Modest but steady job growth has become a hallmark of a nearly 5-year-old economic rebound that remains sluggish yet strikingly resilient. The economy has been slowed by political gridlock, harsh weather and global crises. Those disruptions have hampered growth but havent derailed it.ADVERTISEMENTThough the unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent from a five-year low of 6.6 percent, it did so for an encouraging reason: More people grew optimistic about their job prospects and began seeking work. The unemployment rate rose because some didnt immediately find jobs.Fridays report from the Labor Department suggested that a long-hoped-for acceleration in growth and hiring still hasnt occurred. But that might not be all bad: Households have pared debt and have avoided the excessive spending and borrowing that have undercut explosive economies in the past. And moderate but consistent hiring still means more people have money to spend.Total U.S. credit card debt is still 14 percent lower than before the Great Recession began in December 2007, according to the Federal Reserve."A modest expansion may very well last longer than one that bursts out with big increases in spending and debt," David Berson, an economist at Nationwide Financial, said.Some economists also suggested that having endured harsh weather, the economy may be poised to pick up in coming months."If not for poor weather conditions, job growth would have been stronger," said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "This suggests we should see solid gains ... in coming months."The figures were a welcome surprise after recent economic data showed that severe weather had closed factories, lowered auto sales and slowed home purchases. Along with a sharp increase in wages last month, the jobs report indicates that some employers are confident that consumer spending will pick up in coming months.The severe winter appeared to have less effect on hiring than most economists had feared. Construction companies, which usually stop work in bad weather, added 15,000 jobs. Manufacturing gained 6,000 for a second straight month. Government added 13,000 jobs, the most in six months.Daniel Alpert, managing partner at Westwood Capital, noted that roughly two-thirds of the job growth in January and February was in higher-paying industries. Thats a reversal from all of last year, when about two-thirds of job growth was in lower-paying fields.A category called professional and business services, which includes better-paying jobs such as engineers, accountants and architects, along with some lower-paying jobs such as temporary workers, added 79,000 jobs in February. That was the most in a year.Retailers, though, lost 4,100 jobs, transportation and warehousing firms 3,600.Despite Februarys solid overall gain, the monthly average of 129,000 jobs that employers have added from December through February marks the weakest three-month stretch since mid-2012. Its down from a 225,000 average for the previous three months.The government revised up its estimate of job gains for December and January by a combined 25,000. Decembers gain was revised up from 75,000 to 84,000, Januarys from 113,000 to 129,000.Fridays report makes it likely that the Federal Reserve will continue reducing its monthly bond purchases at its next meeting March 18-19. The Fed is buying Treasury and mortgage bonds to try to keep long-term loan rates low to spur growth. Fed policymakers have reduced their monthly bond purchases by $10 billion at each of their past two meetings to $65 billion.On Monday, Karen Wilson, 42, will start her first full-time job with benefits in nearly eight years. As a data-entry clerk for Peoria County, Ill., she will process traffic tickets, drunk-driving violations and other citations.After a layoff in 2006, Wilson worked several part-time jobs and got financial aid to return to school. Her car broke down last Thanksgiving night after accumulating 153,000 miles. Shes had to wait for a bus in freezing temperatures.Still, things are looking up. Though her new job pays just $12 an hour, "its a foot in the door, and it can lead to so many other things," Wilson said. "I will actually get a lunch hour."Average hourly pay rose 9 cents in February to $24.31, the biggest gain since June. Hourly wages have risen 2.2 percent over the past 12 months, ahead of 1.6 percent inflation over that time. That could mean that employers are finally starting to boost pay after several years of stagnant wages.Economists cautioned that further sustained increases would be needed to signify a broad pickup in pay. Some of the wage increase likely reflects the recent job gains in higher-paying fields.Though harsh winter weather didnt appear to slow hiring much, more than 6 million Americans said weather forced them to work part time in February rather than full time. That was the highest such level for any February in the 36 years that the government has tracked the figure.Those workers were counted as employed and didnt distort either the February job gain or unemployment rate. But for many, fewer hours will mean lower pay. That might be holding back consumer spending and the economy in the current January-March quarter.Some recent reports hint that the economy will accelerate as the weather warms. The number of people who applied for unemployment benefits fell last week and is at about the same level as before the recession.Applications for unemployment benefits essentially reflect layoffs. The decline suggests that companies are confident about future growth, because layoffs would rise if employers expected business to weaken. Instead, companies advertised more jobs online last month, according to the Conference Board.Still, other factors are weighing on the economy. Auto makers and other manufacturers built up big stockpiles of goods in the second half of last year. That means they are likely producing fewer goods this year and is probably one reason factory orders are down.Most economists forecast the economy will grow at a 2 percent annual pace or less in the first three months of the year, down from a 2.4 percent pace in the final three months of 2013. But they expect growth to accelerate in the spring and summer to roughly a 3 percent annual pace."We continue to believe the economy will defrost in the spring and heat up in the summer," said Meyer of BofA Merrill Lynch.___AP Economics Writers Josh Boak and Paul Wiseman contributed to this report.___Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber .	2014-03-07
750	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/09/us-companies-post-more-open-jobs-in-february-but-hiring-remains-sluggish/	US companies post more open jobs in February, but hiring remains sluggish	WASHINGTON –  U.S. employers advertised the most job openings in nearly five years in February, but overall hiring rose at a much slower pace. The figures suggest companies are too cautious about the economy to quickly fill open jobs.The Labor Department said Tuesday that the number of available jobs rose 8.7 percent in February from January to a seasonally adjusted 3.93 million — the highest since May 2008.ADVERTISEMENTAt the same time, companies hired a seasonally adjusted 4.4 million people. Thats just 2.8 percent higher than January. And hiring remains lower than it was a year ago, when it reached 4.49 million.Economists say there are several likely reasons for the disparity. Unemployed workers may lack the skills employers seek. Or companies may not be offering enough pay.Hiring slowed sharply in March, despite the increase in job openings the previous month. Employers added only 88,000 net new jobs last month. Thats the fewest in nine months and nearly half the pace of the previous six months.Companies may have slowed hiring after steep, across-the-board government spending cuts took effect March 1. Those cuts are expected to shave about a half-point from economic growth this year.Many companies may also be more reluctant to fill positions until they find the perfect candidate, according to many recruiting and staffing firms.The increase in openings has steadily reduced the competition for each job. There were 3.1 unemployed people, on average, for each opening in February. Thats down from a peak of 6.7 in July 2009, the highest in the 12 years the government has tracked the data.But Februarys ratio is still above the ratio of 2 to 1 that is typical in a healthy economy. And in February, roughly 12 million Americans were unemployed.Until companies start filling more jobs, the smaller ratio may prove to be less significant than in healthier economies.	2013-04-09

WASHINGTON –  The average U.S. rate on the 30-year mortgage fell closer this week to its historic low and the 15-year rate marked a record low. Low rates are increasing the affordability of buying homes and refinancing.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the average rate for the 30-year fixed loan slipped to 3.40 percent from 3.41 percent last week. Thats near the 3.31 percent rate reached in November, which was the lowest on records dating back to 1971.ADVERTISEMENTThe average rate on the 15-year fixed mortgage fell to 2.61 percent from 2.64 percent last week. Thats below the previous record low of 2.63 percent in November, the lowest since the 1990s.Low mortgage rates are helping drive a housing recovery that began last year. Home prices are rising. Sales of new and previously occupied homes are up this year. Builders broke ground on homes in March at the fastest annual pace in nearly five years.Sales of new homes rebounded last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 417,000, the government reported Tuesday. The increase added to evidence of a sustained housing recovery at the start of the spring buying season.New-home sales are still below the 700,000 pace considered healthy by most economists. But the pace has increased 18.5 percent from a year ago. Most economists see more gains ahead, as housing is likely to remain a consistent driver of economic growth this year.Mortgage rates are low because they tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which has fallen in recent weeks.The Federal Reserve has been buying Treasury bonds since the fall. That has helped to lower the yield. And in recent weeks, concerns that the U.S. and global economies are slowing have led investors to shift money into safer assets, like Treasurys, and away from stocks. Greater demand for Treasurys raises their price and lowers their yield.The yield was 1.72 percent at midday Thursday, up from 1.69 percent last week but still at a historically low level.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country on Monday through Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for 30-year mortgages rose to 0.8 point from 0.7 point last week. The fee for 15-year loans was unchanged at 0.7 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage fell to 2.58 percent from 2.63 percent last week. The fee for one-year adjustable-rate loans increased to 0.5 point from 0.4.The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage rose to 2.62 percent from 2.60 percent. The fee declined to 0.3 point from 0.5.	2013-04-25

Americans cut spending on long-lasting manufactured goods 1.3 percent. That partly reflected a drop in auto sales. Labor Day weekend auto sales were counted in August.ADVERTISEMENTIncome rose 0.5 percent in September, matching the August gain. The increases in both months were the strongest since February. Septembers gain was helped by the end of government furloughs, which had reduced federal pay in the previous two months.The gain in income and the slowdown in spending meant consumers saved 4.9 percent of their after-tax income, up from 4.7 percent in August.	2013-11-08

Theyre important for what they suggest about the larger economy: solid consumer spending and increased manufacturing. "It means the economy is holding up," Cardillo said.The Standard & Poors 500 index rose 13.31 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,653.08.The Dow Jones industrial average gained 96.91 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 14,930.87 and the Nasdaq composite rose 36.43 points, or 1 percent, to 3,649.04.Jim Russell, a senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Cincinnati, said recent economic reports have drawn a brighter picture of the global economy, even as concerns over a U.S. strike on Syria have claimed much of the publics attention.A trade group said Tuesday that U.S. factories increased production last month at the fastest pace since June 2011, propelled by a sharp rise in new orders. Separate reports out Monday showed stronger manufacturing in Europe and China."All of these add up to better economic growth on a global scale," Russell said.On Wednesday, General Motors said its sales rose 15 percent last month, while Chrysler and Ford each reported 12 percent gains. Toyota posted the biggest increase as sales rose nearly 23 percent since August of last year.GM climbed $1.71, or 5 percent, to $35.85, one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 index. Ford rose 57 cents, or 3 percent, to $16.91.The Nasdaq Stock Market ran into technical problems for the second time in two weeks. The exchange reported that its system for disseminating prices had a brief outage, from 11:35 a.m. to 11:41 a.m., but said trading was not affected.On Aug. 22, all trading in Nasdaq-listed stocks was halted for three hours because of a problem with the same quote-disseminating system.Investors were also looking ahead to Friday, when the August jobs report will be released. Economists expect that the U.S. created 177,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate held steady at 7.4 percent, according to the data provider FactSet.Fridays jobs report is the last major piece of economic data the Federal Reserve will have to work with before the central bank decides whether or not to pull back on its massive bond-buying program. That program has kept interest rates abnormally low. While most investors believe the Fed will begin to pull back, the question has become when and how much."Even if the August employment figures were weaker than expected, we think the odds would likely still favor a September (pullback), just of a smaller magnitude," economists with the investment bank RBS wrote in a note to clients.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 2.89 percent from 2.86 percent late Tuesday. The price of crude oil fell $1.31, or 1 percent, to close at $107.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold fell $22, or 2 percent, to $1,390 an ounce.Among other stocks making big moves:— Dollar General jumped $2.51, or 5 percent, to $56.39 after the discount store chain reported profits that narrowly beat Wall Street analysts estimates. In contrast to some of its competitors, Dollar General said sales at stores open more than a year climbed.— Francescas Holdings, which operates the francescas line of retail stores, plunged after reporting results that fell short of Wall Streets estimates. The company cut its forecast for full-year earnings, citing poor customer traffic. Its stock sank $6.23, or 26 percent, to $17.79.— Ciena surged $2.86, or 14 percent, to $23.54.

In a message to employees this week, American Airlines Group Inc. leaders said they plan to go with Americans practice of providing extra legroom with a few seats in the economy cabin, and charging passengers more to sit there.ADVERTISEMENTPassengers willing to pay American $16 to $159 more per flight — up from $8 to $108 two years ago — can get a Main Cabin Extra seat with up to six inches more legroom on most planes. The perk is free for elite members of Americans frequent-flier program.US Airways sells ChoiceSeats. Those are often window or aisle seats near the front of the economy cabin, allowing for a quicker exit after landing, but they have the same legroom as non-choice seats.American hasnt said how it will install the roomier seats on US Airways planes, which eventually will be repainted in Americans colors and logo. It could try to squeeze other rows closer together or use slimmer seats to create more space.Most big airlines now sell economy-cabin seats with extra legroom. United Airlines calls its offering Economy Plus, and Delta Air Lines sells Economy Comfort seats. They often come with other perks such as priority boarding to ensure that buyers can find room for their bag in the overhead bin.Travel experts have strategies for snaring good seats without paying extra. Their advice ranges from setting up email alerts with websites such as ExpertFlyer to politely asking the gate agent.	2014-02-07

Puskar)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Average U.S. rates for fixed mortgages changed little this week.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for the 30-year loan declined to 4.39 percent from 4.41 percent last week. The average for the 15-year loan slipped to 3.44 percent from 3.45 percent.ADVERTISEMENTMortgage rates have risen about a full percentage point since hitting record lows roughly a year ago. The increase was driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve would reduce its $85 billion a month in bond purchases. The Fed determined last month that the economy was strong enough to start trimming the purchases, which have kept long-term interest rates low.The rise in mortgage rates and higher home prices slowed sales of existing homes, which have fallen for three straight months.But overall, 2013 was the best year for housing in seven years. The National Association of Realtors reported Thursday that sales of existing homes edged up slightly in December, helping lift sales for the year to the highest level since 2006.Most economists expect home sales and prices to keep rising this year, but at a slower pace. They forecast sales and prices will likely rise around 5 percent, down from double-digit gains in 2013.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week.

WASHINGTON –  The average U.S. rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage rose this week to 4.51 percent, a two-year high. Rates have been rising on expectations that the Federal Reserve will slow its bond purchases this year.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average on the 30-year loan jumped from 4.29 percent the previous week. Just two months ago, it was 3.35 percent — barely above the record low of 3.31 percent.ADVERTISEMENTThe average on the 15-year fixed mortgage rose to 3.53 percent from 3.39 percent last week. Thats the highest since August 2011.Chairman Ben Bernanke has said the Fed could slow its bond purchases this year if the economy strengthens. The purchases have kept rates low. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which mortgage rates typically track, has been rising.Even with the gains, mortgage rates remain low by historical standards. Low rates have helped fuel a housing recovery that is helping to drive economic growth this year.The annual sales pace of previously occupied homes topped 5 million in May for the first time in 3 ½ years. And sales of new homes rose at the fastest pace in five years.Greater demand, along with a tight supply of homes for sale, has pushed up home prices. It also has led to more home construction, which has created more jobs.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country on Monday through Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was 0.8 point this week, up from 0.7 point last week. The fee for a 15-year loan also rose to 0.8 point from 0.7 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage was unchanged at 2.66 percent. The fee rose to 0.5 point from 0.4.The average rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage rose to 3.26 percent from 3.10 percent. The fee was unchanged at 0.7 point.	2013-07-11

But underlying inflation showed only a modest gain.The Labor Department says wholesale prices rose 0.8 percent in June compared with May when prices had risen 0.5 percent. It was the biggest gain since a 1 percent jump in September and was driven by a 7.2 percent surge in gasoline prices.ADVERTISEMENTOutside of the volatile energy and food sectors, core inflation was up just 0.2 percent in June. Core prices have risen 1.7 percent over the past 12 months. Aside from sharp swings in gas prices, inflation has increased very slowly over the past year, giving the Federal Reserve the room to keep interest rates low to boost the economy.	2013-07-12

But the economy is likely slowing in the current quarter.The Commerce Departments third and final estimate Thursday of growth for the July-September quarter was revised up from its previous estimate of a 2.7 percent annual growth rate.ADVERTISEMENTGrowth in the third quarter was more than twice the 1.3 percent growth rate in the April-June quarter. But disruptions from Superstorm Sandy and uncertainty weighing on consumers and businesses from the "fiscal cliff" are likely holding back growth in the October-December quarter. Many analysts predict an annual growth rate of just 1.5 percent for this quarter.Robert Kavcic, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the upward revision to third-quarter growth didnt change his view that the economy is slowing in the current quarter to an annual growth rate below 2 percent. Kavcic said a temporary jump in defense spending and business stockpiling in the July-September period is likely being reversed this quarter.And many economists arent expecting much improvement in the January-March quarter. The latest forecast from 48 economists for the National Association of Business Economics is for an annual growth rate of just 1.8 percent in the first quarter of 2013. Growth at that level is considered too weak to significantly lower the unemployment rate, which was 7.7 percent in November.But if Congress and the White House reach agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff, growth could accelerate next year, many economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, have said. The Fed last week said it plans to keep a key interest rate at a record low as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent. And it forecast that unemployment would stay that high until late 2015.The governments final estimate of a 3.1 percent growth rate for gross domestic product last quarter is a sharp improvement over its initial estimate of a 2 percent rate — a figure that it later revised up to 2.7 percent based on a buildup in business stockpiles.GDP measures the nations total output of goods and services — from restaurant meals and haircuts to airplanes and appliances.The further upward revision this month reflected stronger consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity. The government said consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter, above its previous estimate of 1.4 percent.The Commerce Department also revised up its estimate of spending by state and local governments to show a gain of 0.3 percent — the first quarterly increase in three years. State and local governments had previously been slashing payrolls and other spending in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Total government spending grew at 3.9 percent annual rate last quarter, reflecting a surge in defense spending.The economy also got a boost in the third quarter from trade: Exports grew at a faster pace than previously estimated.The NABE forecasting panel has said it expects GDP to grow 2.1 percent in 2013, little changed from expected 2.2 percent expansion this year. That would continue the tepid growth that has persisted since the official end of the recession in mid-2009.But the NABE panel said it thinks growth will accelerate later in the year as long as Congress and the administration resolve their debate over taxes and government spending. Doing so would remove the uncertainty that, in part, is holding back spending, many economists say.	2012-12-20

Many farmers looking for a quick buck launched ventures to fill the void, only to go under.ADVERTISEMENTMost who remain in business come from agricultural backgrounds and have eased into hops. The goal now seems to be slow-but-steady growth, even in areas where brewers are offering high-priced contracts or money to help start farms.Paul Graham, president of Central Waters Brewing Co. in Wisconsin, remembers when his phone rang daily with would-be growers. He partnered with four other brewers in 2009 to provide a handful of farmers with seed money. More than four years later, the cooperative has only about six acres of hops in production. The entire state -- known for its love of beer -- has about 50 acres."The success that weve seen is mostly with some experienced farmers who are kind of diversifying or who have experience on a farm for a long time," Graham said. "A lot of the hobbyists who got into it right away, most of them are back out of it just because its labor-intensive and youre not making much money."Randy Flores started a farm in western Colorado in 2008 but gave it up two years later. He had banked on a partners real estate commissions to provide capital to buy processing equipment, and the money fell through during the recession.With a limited market and falling prices for unprocessed hops, Flores didnt see the farm making it. The 54-year-old Denver resident now has a business buying and selling hops to smaller brewers.People were "romanced" into growing hops, Flores said, but "its a hell of a lot of work for just a little bit of money."It costs about $10,000 to buy rootstock and set up the trellis system required to grow hops vines. Farmers erect 16- to 20-foot poles connected by cables, from which they run strings to the ground for the plants to climb up. The cone-like flowers that grow atop the vines give beer its unique, bitter taste.Equipment to pick, bale and dry hops costs tens of thousands of dollars more, putting the initial investment for a 10-acre farm at close to $250,000, said Ron Godin, a hops specialist with Colorado State University Extension.Randy Urness and his wife conducted a "scavenger hunt" with Craigslist and newspaper ads to find old telephone poles and secondhand cable to build trellises on their farm in Rosholt, Wis. They planted 700 rhizomes, or rootstocks, on 1.5 acres in 2010 and have gradually built up to about 2,100 plants on three acres.Urness said it will be years before his investment pays off, particularly since the plants take up to five years to reach full production."The last year has been, by far, a net loss," said Urness, 47. "Hopefully, after another year or two, well be able to say, `OK, what weve put into it this year vs. what weve gotten out of it, we have made some profit and been able to cover loans and things of that nature."Hops can be used fresh, or wet, but they spoil rapidly -- the cones Graham buys are used within 24 hours of harvest. Most beer is made with hops that have been dried, crushed into a powder and formed into shelf-stable pellets that resemble rabbit food. One pound of dry hops is equivalent to four pounds of wet hops.Making the jump from producing wet hops for single-batch beers to providing pellets for year-round brewing is the "major hurdle" most growers face, said Ryan Houghton, a 34-year-old software consultant from Portland, Maine, who has been building a hops farm with several partners.A pelletizer can cost as much as $250,000. Wisconsin has at least three, but states like Colorado have none.AC Golden Brewing Co., the Colorado-based craft arm of MillerCoors, has helped its 13 contract growers get around this problem by hauling dried cones to Washington state for processing before using them in its Colorado Native Lager. The brewer also pays $15 per pound for hops -- well over the market rate -- to help offset its farmers startup costs.But even with AC Goldens incentives and more than 100 other craft brewers eager to buy Colorado-grown hops, farmers have planted only about 75 acres there.In New York, which has more than 140 craft breweries, farmers have planted about 150 acres and hope to increase to more than 250 by summer, said Steve Miller, a Cornell University Cooperative Extension hops specialist.Another big challenge for those farmers is a lack of information.Hops havent been grown commercially outside the Pacific Northwest for more than 100 years, and knowledge of the plant died out in that time. Methods used to combat fungus, ward off pests and irrigate in arid parts of Washington state, with its 27,000 acres of hops, dont necessarily work in more humid climates, said Ryan Trzebiatowski, a 33-year-old engineer who has a small hops farm in Amherst, Wis.In many cases, farmers dont even know how much they can grow per acre. Trzebiatowski harvested 3,000 wet pounds last year; his goal is 5,000. Some Western farms hit 10,000.But one thing is clear -- theres a "sex appeal" in hops that other crops dont have, Trzebiatowski said."People ask if Im going to continue doing this, and my answer is yes," he said. "Its a fun project, its not all consuming of my time, and its a good conversation starter."	2014-01-11
766	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/02/28/us-consumer-confidence-improves-slightly-in-february-despite-winter-storms/	US consumer confidence improves slightly in February despite winter storms	WASHINGTON –  A surprisingly optimistic outlook among younger Americans and a higher stock market pushed up a measure of U.S. consumer sentiment in February.The increase was small, but the harsh winter weather appears to have had little effect on Americans confidence so far. Thats a sign that spending might pick up in the coming months.ADVERTISEMENTThe University of Michigans consumer sentiment index ticked up to 81.6 in February from 81.2 in January. Its still slightly below Decembers figure."While the weather made trips to the store more difficult, the data suggest that purchases were postponed rather than canceled," the report said. For example, consumers home-buying plans were largely unchanged.The survey also found that Americans under age 35 have grown more optimistic that their pay will increase. On average, they expect income gains of 5 percent over the next 12 months, the survey found. Thats the largest expected gain since November 2006.Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said that is a welcome change for an age group that has been particularly hard hit by the recession and sluggish recovery. Unemployment rates for younger Americans have been much higher than for older workers since the recession ended almost five years ago. And their income gains have been weak. Anecdotes of college graduates living with their parents and working low-wage jobs are widespread.The Michigan surveys finding provides some hope that such trends might be turning around. In a healthy economy, younger Americans usually anticipate solid income growth as they gain experience and become more productive, Curtin said. Optimism about future income may suggest that more people under 35 are finding jobs and that some who are working are getting promotions, he added.Still, other surveys havent found rising optimism among younger people. In an Associated Press-GfK poll in January, just 38 percent of those under 35 said they expected their financial situation to improve in the coming year, down from around half who said so through most of 2011 and 2012.Among Americans as a whole, the expectation is that their paychecks will rise just 0.9 percent in the coming year. While that matches a six-month high reached in January, its still below the inflation rate and is low by historical standards.	2014-02-28

Bernanke said. Qualified borrowers are being prevented from getting home loans, he said during a speech to the Operation HOPE Global Financial Dignity Summit in Atlanta.ADVERTISEMENTOperation HOPE is a non-profit organization that provides free economic education and financial counseling to lower- and middle-income Americans.Bernankes comments came on a day when mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage fell to a record low of 3.34 percent. Rates have been low all year but have fallen further since the Federal Reserve started buying mortgage bonds in September to encourage more borrowing and spending.The rates have helped boost home sales and have led more people to refinance existing loans. Yet many have been unable to take advantage of the low rates because banks now require higher credit scores, stricter income documentation and larger down payments before approving loans.The Fed has tried to make home-buying more affordable through its bond purchases. Minutes from the central banks October meeting released on Wednesday indicated the Fed may pursue more bond purchases in the month ahead. A new program could be announced when the Fed next meets on Dec. 11-12.In his speech, Bernanke gave no hint of what future moves the Fed might take. But he said officials at the central bank understood the problems still facing the U.S. economy.Bernanke said the housing has shown signs of recovery this year. But he said construction activity, sales and prices remain much lower than they were before the crisis. About 20 percent of mortgage borrowers remain underwater, meaning that they owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth, he noted.Bernanke said that the Fed and other regulators would continue to pursue efforts to make credit more available to potential home buyers.___Associated Press Writer Michael Biesecker in Atlanta contributed to this report.	2012-11-15

WASHINGTON –  The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits remained near the lowest level in more than five years last week, a sign that companies are cutting few jobs.The Labor Department says weekly applications for benefits fell 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 331,000.

The average has fallen 10 percent this year.Though employers are cutting few jobs, most have yet to start hiring aggressively.Employers have added an average of 192,000 jobs a month since January.

This allows high-speed computers to make trades before others gain access to the data.Modern stock trading is dominated by automated computer systems that make trades in fractions of a second, and traders can profit from receiving data even milliseconds before its public release. Consumer sentiment regarding the economy is watched closely because consumers spending accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity.The New York Times reported that the attorney generals investor protection bureau is looking at whether preferential disclosure of data is a fair and appropriate business practice.Thomson Reuters said in an emailed statement it "strongly believes that news and information companies can legally distribute non-governmental data and exclusive news through services provided to fee-paying subscribers.""It is widely understood that news and information companies compete for exclusive news and differentiated content to help their customers make better informed trading and investment decisions," the statement said.Company spokeswoman Yvonne Diaz added that Thomson Reuters has always been transparent about how it releases proprietary data so its customers can chose the level of service they want.Last month, the Conference Board announced that it will no longer provide its economic reports in advance to news organizations because it suspects the data is being diverted early to computer-driven trading systems, which can unfairly profit from it.It had long provided its monthly data to reporters 30 minutes before the information is publicly released. That early access allowed journalists to prepare news reports ahead of the informations public release.Last year, the Labor Department revoked early access to its employment data for several companies that deliver data to high-speed traders but produce little or no original news content.	2013-07-08

Or has the rise in telecommuting led to a drop in productivity or creativity?Chances are, one telework supporter said, the tech giant just wasnt doing it right."If you dont know where your people are and what theyre doing, then you havent implemented properly, so shes got her hands full," said Kate Lister in San Diego, Calif., co-founder of Global Workplace Analytics, which collects data on the subject for its Telework Research Network.Slogging through decades of research on the value of telecommuting is complicated. Small studies have been done by employer membership organizations, companies looking at their own ranks, consulting firms and government agencies, along with academics. Some use small samples, others rely on a wild array of statistics from the U.S. Census, the Small Business Administration or the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The verdicts are mixed and the research often so focused on a work force or issue related to flex options that its difficult to make conclusions.The new Families and Work Institute study, on the other hand, deals solely with employers in the U.S., delving into a broad range of family friendly programs, policies and benefits. The institute found that 63 percent of employers surveyed allow at least some employees to work partially at home on an occasional basis. Thats up from 34 percent in a comparable study done for the institute in 2005.More of the workers were higher-wage earners. Overall, the number of employees who work entirely from home was 3 percent, compared to 64 percent who sometimes do, said Ellen Galinsky, the institutes president and co-founder.Men were significantly more likely than women to work partially at home — 67 percent compared to 59 percent of women, partially a reflection of more men in jobs where the option is possible. Men also were more likely to work mainly from home.Neither Lister nor Galinsky has the inside scoop on whats happening at Yahoo, but Galinsky was steadfast about one thing."To take away all flexibility for everyone all the time is an overreaction," she said. "If you know that people will be more innovative and collaborative by being together, that is a positive. But sometimes people need time alone. Why do the best ideas occur in the shower, or when were walking the dog?"Galinsky and others who study work-life balance dont anticipate a backlash among other employers due to Yahoo. And the company itself followed up an internal memo leaked to the tech blog All things D with a curt statement indicating the prohibition might not be forever.Meantime, Lister said about 2.5 percent of the U.S. civilian population, or about 3 million people, work at home at least half the time, according to U.S. Census data. The rate of growth was slowed by the recession, with some researchers suggesting its flat at the moment.Why isnt the number even higher? "The biggest reason is that managers dont trust their employees," Lister said. "Theyre still managing the 21st-century work force with 20th-century styles of commands and controls, back to the days of sweatshops and typing pools. They like to be able to see the backs of their heads."The perceived benefits for workers are clear. While 37 percent of the companies in Galinskys report cite retention of employees as the main reason for developing workplace flexibility and other programs, Lister said 90 percent of teleworkers "feel being able to work flexibly improves their quality of life."But what about for employers?The leaked Yahoo memo, written by Jackie Reses, the companys human resources director, said in part:"Some of the best decisions and insights come from hallway and cafeteria discussions, meeting new people and impromptu team meeting. Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home. We need to be one Yahoo!, and that starts with physically being together."Researchers in the field note a dearth in credible studies that confirm a boost in creative flow or innovation from face time.And telecommuting may actually boost productivity, at least where it stands in the number of hours worked, said researchers Mary C. Noonan and Jennifer L. Glass in a study of telecommuting published last June in the Monthly Labor Review, a publication of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.The two studied employees who work regularly but not exclusively from home and found that for them, telecommuting was not a substitute for working onsite during an agreed upon work week but rather was in addition to a full week, at least half the time."People have only looked at the benefits without seeing that maybe some of these policies can come back to bite you," said Noonan, a sociologist who teaches classes on the American family and statistics at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.Parents, Glass said, are no more likely to telecommute than non-parents; women no more likely than men.The report from the Families and Work Institute said gains have been made in other flex options as well as working from home over the seven-year period covered. The offer of flex time, for instance, increased to 77 percent from 66 percent. Daily time off when important needs arise went from 77 percent to 87 percent.The institutes survey, conducted by Harris Interactive by phone and questionnaire, included 1,126 U.S. employers with 50 or more workers.Galinsky had expected the recession would squeeze workplace flexibility, and attributes much of the gains to companies looking to cut real estate costs and other expenses. Of companies with at least eight family-friendly policies, she said, 9 percent cited increased productivity as the reason. Five percent cited increasing employee commitment or engagement. One percent cited recruiting and retaining women.Only 10 percent of the employers in the study cited a potential loss of productivity and difficulty supervising staff as reasons for not adopting more family-friendly policies. Twenty five percent cited cost, 12 percent cited job requirements and workloads, and 7 percent potential abuse.Some have decried the Yahoo ban as something that would hurt women — an especially heated argument because Mayer had become a potent feminist symbol when she was hired last July while pregnant.But Galinsky said most companies offer flexibility because of benefits to the bottom line rather than a commitment to work-family balance.After the revelation, Yahoo urged the world not to read too much into the ban beyond the walls of Yahoo itself. The company has declined further comment.Glass, a professor of sociology and population research at the University of Texas at Austin, suspects little to no reliable research supports the notion that hallway meetings are anything more than gossip sessions or recaps of baseball scores from the night before. Does proximity, in this age of videoconferencing, social networks and other tools, still matter?"Certainly there is nothing out there that you can easily find that suggests innovation is linked to face time," she said.Some former Yahoos, as company employees are called, have been quoted anonymously in news and blog reports as saying dead wood is hiding at home and the ban isnt such a bad idea."If youve got a performance issue with people, deal with that as a performance issue," Galinsky said. "If people are slacking off and not working, then deal with it that way. This was a blunt instrument."___Follow Leanne Italie on Twitter at http://twitter.com/litalie	2013-03-05

The figure shows employers are laying off fewer and fewer workers, an encouraging sign one day before the government will issue its August jobs report.Weekly applications are just 1,000 above a five-year low reached last month, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four week average, a less volatile measure, declined 3,000 to 328,500. Thats the lowest point since October 2007.ADVERTISEMENTEconomists forecast that the August jobs report will show employers added 177,000 jobs, up from 162,000 in July. The unemployment rate is expected to remain 7.4 percent.Applications are a proxy for layoffs. They have fallen 5 percent in the past two months, raising hopes that hiring could pick up.Still, the unemployment rate is well above the 5 percent to 6 percent range associated with a normal economy. And most of the improvement in the job market has occurred because layoffs have fallen. Hiring, by contrast, remains modest. Fewer layoffs can boost net job growth even when businesses arent filling many job openings.Nearly 4.4 million Americans received unemployment benefits in the week that ended Aug. 17, the latest period for which figures are available. Thats about 70,000 fewer than the previous week. A year ago, 5.5 million Americans were receiving benefits.Many of the jobs created in recent months have been lower-paying, part-time positions in industries such as hotels, restaurants and retail. Higher-paying industries such as manufacturing and construction have mostly shed jobs since spring.But some signs indicate that hiring in both industries could pick up. A private survey released Tuesday showed that factory activity grew last month at the fastest pace in more than two years. And manufacturers added jobs, though at a slower pace than in the previous month.Spending on U.S. construction projects, meanwhile, rose to its highest level in more than four years in July. It was spurred by strength in both housing and commercial building.The economy expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, a modest pace but much faster than the 1.1 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. Home construction and business investment spending were two key drivers of growth.Many economists think growth is slowing to about a 2 percent annual rate in the current July-September quarter.	2013-09-05

APPA President and CEO Bob Vetere predicts another 4 percent gain this year.ADVERTISEMENTAt about $34.3 billion, food and vet care represented about two-thirds of total spending, with money spent on supplies and over-the-counter medications rising by more than 7 percent. Spending on the growing market of alternative vet care, such as acupuncture, totaled about $12.5 billion.Vetere says spending on services like grooming, boarding, hotels and pet-sitting grew nearly 10 percent during 2012 to almost $4.4 billion.	2013-02-22

He suggested that the agreement could include a moratorium on debt payments until countries pull out of recession."The main concern is finding an end to this crisis," Tsipras said, speaking through an interpreter. "There has to be a solution for Europe that gives creditors their money back and the Greek economy, and other economies, time to recover."Greece is entering its sixth year of a recession with its unemployment rate at 26 percent.Tsipras heads Syriza, a collection of left-wing parties. In recent polls, Syrizas popularity rivals that of the New Democracy party, which currently leads the governing coalition in parliament. Tsipras has been an outspoken critic of the budget-cutting measures adopted by the Greek government in exchange for rescue loans from other European states and the International Monetary Fund.During elections last year, Tsipras made headlines for saying that his first step when in power would be to cancel Greeces bailout agreements. Many worried that such a move would lead Greece to drop the euro currency and spread turmoil from Europe to the global financial system.Tsipras said hes been widely misunderstood. "I was the most dangerous man in Europe," he said. But his basic arguments have gained wider acceptance. The IMF, a longtime advocate of austerity policies, has recently said cutting social spending in the face of a shrinking economy only makes things worse. And analysts argue that Europes underlying problems are bigger than those of any one country."We feel justified because we were among the first to say it was a European crisis, not just a Greek crisis," Tsipras said.	2013-01-25

However, both months represented a slower pace of sales than earlier in 2013, reflecting the drag from higher mortgage rates and higher home prices.ADVERTISEMENTFor all of 2013, sales totaled 5.09 million, the best performance since 2006, when sales totaled 6.48 million. However, the sales gains in both 2005 and 2006 represented an unsustainable housing bubble.

According to appeal petitions, Cheerleaders owes $486,482 and Club Risque owes $320,538. The city audited the lap dance encounters then “issued an assessment going back five years,” Bochetto said, plus interest and oenalties.“It’s over the top,” he told the newspaper. “Unbelievable.”Mark McDonald, a spokesman for Mayor Michael Nutter, said the city does not comment on pending litigation.The clubs, which pay business taxes in addition to the amusement tax, will now make their case before the Tax Review Board on July 23. A decision may be appealed in Common Pleas Court.A source close to the matter told the newspaper that city officials feel they can institute an amusement tax because the lap dance is a separate experience.Bochetto, meanwhile, argues that the city is taxing the same thing twice, citing the city code pertaining to the amusement tax: “Imposed upon the admission fee or privilege to attend or engage in any amusement.”Click for more from the Philadelphia Daily News.	2013-07-09

The strikes are being held by the Organization United for Respect at Walmart. An organizer for the group said the collection bins at the Canton store help make the point that Walmart workers deserve better pay.“Why would a company do that?” she told the newspaper. “The company needs to stand up and give them their 40 hours and a living wage, so they don’t have to worry about whether they can afford Thanksgiving.”Lundberg defended the companys treatment of workers, and said it takes extra steps to help those that have financial problems. He noted that employees can also receive grants up to $1,500 via its Associates in Critical Need Trust, which can be used to address homelessness, serious medical illness and major repairs to primary vehicles. Grants totaling $80 million have been made since 2001, the newpspaper reports.	2013-11-18

That was the first quarterly gain in small business lending since the FDIC began tracking loans on a quarterly basis at the start of 2010. The FDIC is a government agency that insures bank deposits and oversees financial companies.ADVERTISEMENTDespite the year-end improvement, the lending environment for small business remains weak. The December number was down from $598 billion in the final quarter of 2011 and $626 billion at the end of 2010.The FDIC numbers included commercial and industrial loans, along with commercial real estate loans under $1 million.Surveys have shown that small business owners remain cautious about borrowing. Low demand has been one of the factors behind weak lending since the recession ended.On Tuesday a survey released by Thomson Reuters and PayNet showed that small businesses grew more reluctant to take out loans to buy equipment or expand in February as federal budget cuts approached. That continued a weak trend in lending that the two companies saw throughout 2012 and into the new year. PayNet provides credit ratings on small businesses.The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index fell to 101.3 from 111.7 in January. The January reading was revised downward from a previously reported 113.1. In December the index stood at 115.Small businesses have been reluctant to borrow since the recession because theyve wanted to lower their debt burden, and because theyve been uncertain about the economy and gridlock in Washington that has led to $85 billion in budget cuts. Theyre also uneasy about borrowing while they wait to see how much health insurance will cost them next year, when the governments health care overhaul is fully implemented.The Thomson Reuters/PayNet study was compiled from data on commercial loans and leases in PayNets database.	2013-04-03

845	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/25/survey-americans-confidence-in-job-market-improving-steadily-from-great/	Survey: Americans confidence in job market improving steadily from Great Recession	WASHINGTON –  Confidence in the U.S. job market has rebounded to roughly a normal level from its record low after the Great Recession, a trend that could help boost the economy.Americans increasingly feel they could find a new job if necessary, according to the results of the 2012 General Social Survey, a long-standing poll of public opinion. And fear of being laid off dropped last year from its 2010 peak to roughly its average for the 35 years the question has been asked.ADVERTISEMENTThe percentage of Americans who said it would be somewhat or very easy to find a job if they lost theirs rose to 54 percent last year from 46 percent in 2010. The 2010 figure was the lowest since 1983, when the United States was also emerging from a deep recession. On average in the surveys history, about 58 percent of respondents have said it would be very or somewhat easy to find a job.As layoffs have declined, fewer Americans fear losing their job. Last year, 11 percent of adults thought it was somewhat or very likely that theyd lose theirs. That was down from a record-high 16 percent in 2010. And it matches the 11 percent average the survey has found since it began asking the question.Americans may be feeling even more secure now than when the survey was taken last year. The number of layoffs fell in January to the lowest level in the 12 years the government has tracked the data. Fewer people are seeking unemployment benefits.And employers have stepped up hiring, though the job gains slowed in March. Employers added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012, an average of about 180,000 a month. Thats enough to slowly lower the unemployment rate.Even though the rate remains high at 7.6 percent, greater confidence among those who have a job could encourage more consumer spending and boost economic growth."If youre not afraid of being laid off, youre going to spend more of your money," said Drew Matus, an economist at UBS.The General Social Survey has been conducted roughly every two years since 1972. The survey is a project of the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago, with primary funding from the National Science Foundation.From mid-March through September last year, 1,975 adults were asked about their financial situation and their feelings about the job market. The surveys margin of error was plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. The results were only recently made available.The survey found that confidence in the economy varied by education. Those with college degrees felt more job security than those with less education. And since the recession ended in June 2009, Americans with a college education have reported greater improvement in confidence than have those with high school degrees or less.Only 6 percent of college-educated Americans said in 2012 that it was somewhat or very likely that theyd lose their job. That was down from 10 percent in 2010.Those with high school degrees were also more confident in 2012: Twelve percent of this group feared losing their job, down from 19 percent two years earlier.But Americans with less than a high school degree reported little change: 26 percent felt it was somewhat or very likely they would be laid off in 2012, about on par with the 29 percent who felt so in 2010.On whether it would be somewhat or very easy to find another job, 59 percent of those with college degrees said so, up from 52 percent in 2010. Among high school graduates, that figure rose to 53 percent last year from 43 percent in 2010.Those without a high school degree still lack confidence: Only 40 percent said it would be somewhat or very easy to find new work, essentially unchanged from the 41 percent who said so in 2010.Among the surveys other findings:— Fewer Americans say their financial situation has worsened in the past few years, though the proportion remains high. A record 37 percent of Americans in 2010 said their finances had deteriorated. In 2012, that figure fell to 30 percent, still the second-highest on record.— More Americans define themselves as in the "lower class" than at any time since 1972. A record 8 percent classified themselves as lower class in 2012, the same as in 2010. That compares with the record low of 4 percent in 1985.— The proportion of Americans who expect their children to be somewhat or much worse off financially than they are was 20 percent in 2012, compared with 18 percent in 2010. The figure is slightly below the record level of 22 percent in 1996.___Follow Chris Rugaber on Twitter at https://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber	2013-04-25

Inventories had fallen a slightly 0.1 percent in May. Sales rose 0.2 percent in June after a solid 1.1 percent increase in May.ADVERTISEMENTThe stagnant level for stockpiles could be setting the stage for inventory rebuilding in coming months. That would support increased factory production and overall economic growth in the second half of this year.Business stockpiles in June stood at a seasonally adjusted $1.66 trillion, 3.5 percent higher than a year ago. Inventories at the manufacturing and retail levels both rose 0.1 percent. Stockpiles at the wholesale level fell 0.2 percent, the third consecutive decline.Junes sales increase was led by solid gains at the retail and wholesale level. But sales by manufacturers declined 0.4 percent.A separate report Tuesday showed that retail sales advanced a modest 0.2 percent in July. But a "core" category that excludes volatile auto, gas and business supply products, surged 0.5 percent, the strongest such advance since a similar gain in December.The government estimated last month that the economy grew at a lackluster 1.7 percent annual rate from April through June. Economists think the growth rate will be revised up because a report last week showed that U.S. companies exported a record number of goods in June. Some analysts think the revision could increase estimated growth in the April-June period to an annual rate of around 2.3 percent.Many economists predict that growth will rebound further to a rate of about 2.5 percent in the second half of this year.	2013-08-13

That followed a 1.3 percent rise in November, which partly reflected a rebound from Superstorm Sandy.ADVERTISEMENTTotal industrial production increased 0.3 percent in December from November. That followed a 1 percent rise in November. Production slowed last month mostly because utility output dropped 4.8 percent, reflecting unseasonably warm weather.Factory output is the most important component of industrial production. The back-to-back gains offered some hope that manufacturing could be picking up after struggling through most of 2012.Many factories have been hurt by a slowdown in consumer spending and weaker global growth that has dampened demand for U.S. exports.One exception has been U.S. auto companies, which boosted production sharply last year to meet the best sales since 2007. December was no different: Production of autos and motor vehicle parts rose 2.6 percent. And analysts are forecasting that Americans will buy even more cars and trucks in 2013.There have been a few other encouraging signs that factories may be recovering from their slump.The Institute for Supply Managements closely watched index of manufacturing activity rose to a level that signaled growth in December. And manufacturers added 25,000 jobs last month — the best hiring spree for the sector since May.Economists believe manufacturing could also get a boost from stronger business investment, provided that Congress raises the federal borrowing limit without a fight that damages business confidence. Companies are sitting on large amounts of cash. Analysts believe many are poised to start spending this year on computers, machinery and equipment to expand and modernize their operations.The overall economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the July-September quarter. But analysts believe activity slowed considerably in the October-December quarter to a rate below 2 percent or less, in part because companies cut back on restocking.Less restocking leads to slower factory production, which weighs on economic growth.	2013-01-16

When family members did call, they were initially routed to a reservations line rather than a crisis hotline. Asiana also lacked translators and personnel trained in crash response, the transportation department found.In the late 1990s, after airlines were roundly criticized for ignoring desperate requests for information after crashes, Congress required carriers to dedicate significant attention to families of passengers.Last fall, The Associated Press reviewed plans filed by two dozen foreign airlines and found cases in which carriers had not updated their family assistance plans as required.Since APs story, several airlines have updated family assistance plans and filed new paperwork with the Department of Transportation. Among them is Asianas bigger rival, Korean Air.	2014-02-25

Chinas ruling Communist Party said in a broad blueprint for reform issued Friday that it will allow couples to have two children if one of the parents is an only child, adding to existing exemptions for groups including rural dwellers and some ethnic minorities, as well as couples consisting of two only children. But the impact will depend on how the policy is implemented, and how couples respond.ADVERTISEMENTStill, economists said anything that further grows Chinas population—which had been projected to peak around 1.4 billion in 2020—is likely to add to demand for U.S. farm goods. In particular, China will need more corn, wheat, soybeans and meal made from the oilseeds to feed the chickens, hogs, cattle and dairy cows it will need to produce to feed its growing population, said Bruce A. Babcock, a professor of economics at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa."More children will mean more dairy products and as those children age, meat consumption will rise," said Dan Kowalski, an economist at Greenwood Village, Colo.-based CoBank, which provides loans, leases and export financing to agribusinesses. "China will not be able to meet all its corn and soybean needs so it will rely on more imports. The U.S. is a prime supplier to China and that trade will become more important as time goes on."China is forecast to import 7 million metric tons of corn and 69 million tons of soybeans in the marketing year that started on Oct. 1, both records, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Most of that is used to fatten animals consumed by Chinas burgeoning middle class, which ate 13.5 million tons of chicken and 52.7 million tons of pork, also records, USDA data show. China will import 775,000 tons of pork in 2014, again the most ever.The countrys gross domestic product rose 7.8% in the quarter that ended on Sept. 30 from the same three months a year earlier. Citigroup economists Nathan Sheets and Robert A. Sockin said in an October report that Chinas "deteriorating demographics," an aging population due to its one-child policy, may trim 3.25 percentage points off Chinas annual growth rate between 2012 and 2030, compared to its double-digit growth of past decades.An older population has largely reduced the outlook for Chinas workforce as many people having children now will soon become less productive as they grow older, said Danny Klinefelter, a professor of agriculture economics at Texas A&M University, in College Station, Texas. To stay competitive, China will need to increase the size of its workforce or face declining productivity, he said. Rising incomes in the country also will boost food consumption, he said."Any time you increase population, particularly in country that has ability to buy, then food consumption is going to go up," Mr. Klinefelter said. "Africa has lots of population growth but not the wherewithal to pay for it all. China does."Click for more from The Wall Street Journal.	2013-11-16

Since 2008, the number of people who call themselves middle class has fallen by a fifth, according to a survey in January 2014 by the Pew Research Center, from 53 percent to 44 percent. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  A sense of belonging to the middle class occupies a cherished place in America. It conjures images of self-sufficient people with stable jobs and pleasant homes working toward prosperity.Yet nearly five years after the Great Recession ended, more people are coming to the painful realization that theyre no longer part of it.ADVERTISEMENTThey are former professionals now stocking shelves at grocery stores, retirees struggling with rising costs and people working part-time jobs but desperate for full-time pay. Such setbacks have emerged in economic statistics for several years. Now theyre affecting how Americans think of themselves.Since 2008, the number of people who call themselves middle class has fallen by nearly a fifth, according to a survey in January by the Pew Research Center, from 53 percent to 44 percent. Forty percent now identify as either lower-middle or lower class compared with just 25 percent in February 2008.According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans who say theyre middle or upper-middle class fell 8 points between 2008 and 2012, to 55 percent.And the most recent National Opinion Research Centers General Social Survey found that the vast proportion of Americans who call themselves middle or working class, though still high at 88 percent, is the lowest in the surveys 40-year history. Its fallen 4 percentage points since the recession began in 2007.The trend reflects a widening gap between the richest Americans and everyone else, one thats emerged gradually over decades and accelerated with the Great Recession. The difference between the income earned by the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans and by a median-income household has risen 24 percent in 30 years, according to the Census Bureau.Whether or not people see themselves as middle class, theres no agreed-upon definition of the term. In part, its a state of mind. Incomes or lifestyles that feel middle class in Kansas can feel far different in Connecticut. People with substantial incomes often identify as middle class if they live in urban centers with costly food, housing and transportation.In any case, individuals and families who feel theyve slipped from the middle class are likely to spend and borrow less. Such a pullback, in turn, squeezes the economy, which is fueled mainly by consumer spending."How they think is reflected in how they act," said Richard Morin, a senior editor at the Pew Research Center.People are generally slow to acknowledge downward mobility. Many regard themselves as middle class even if their incomes fall well above or below the average. Experts say the rise in Americans who feel theyve slipped below the middle class suggests something deeply rooted.More people now think "its harder to achieve" the American dream than thought so several decades ago, said Mark Rank, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis.Three years ago, Kristina Feldotte, 47, and her husband earned a combined $80,000. She considered herself solidly middle class. The couple and their four children regularly vacationed at a lake near their home in Saginaw, Michigan.But in August 2012, Feldotte was laid off from her job as a special education teacher. Shes since managed to find only part-time teaching work. Though her husband still works as a truck salesman, their income has sunk by more than half to $36,000."Now were on the upper end of lower class," Feldotte said.Americans self-perception coincides with data documenting a shrinking middle class: The percentage of households with income within 50 percent of the median — one way to define a broad middle class — fell from 50 percent in 1970 to 42 percent in 2010.The Pew survey didnt ask respondents to specify their income. Still, Pew has found in the past that people who call themselves middle class generally fit the broad definitions that economists use.Roughly 8.4 percent of respondents to the National Opinion Research Centers survey, last conducted in 2012, said they consider themselves lower class. Thats the surveys highest percentage ever, up from 5.4 percent in 2006. NORC is a social science research organization at the University of Chicago.Tom Smith, director of the NORC, said even slight shifts are significant. Class self-identification "is traditionally one of the most stable measures" in the survey, he said.By contrast to the most recent recession, the severe 1981-82 downturn had little effect on class self-identification in Smiths survey.Why do so many no longer regard themselves as middle class? A key reason is that the recession eliminated 8.7 million jobs. A disproportionate number were middle-income positions. Those losses left what economists describe as a "hollowed out" workforce, with more higher- and lower-paying and fewer middle-income jobs.Rob McGahen, 30, hasnt yet found a job that paid as well as the purchasing agent position at Boeings defense division that he left in 2011. Nervous about the sustainability of that job because of government defense cuts, McGahen quit after buying a bar near his St. Louis home.The bar eventually went bankrupt and cost him his house. He and his wife moved to Pensacola, Fla., where hes had little luck finding work in defense contracting.Now, he works in the produce section of a supermarket. His wife earns the bulk of their income as a speech pathologist. Their household income has been cut in half, from $110,000 to $55,000, and he and his wife have put off having children."Its definitely been a step back," McGahen said.Now living in an apartment, he misses the couples three-bedroom house on a quiet cul-de-sac in a St. Louis suburb.Home ownership is among factors economists cite as markers of middle-class status. Others include being able to vacation, help children pay for college and save for a secure retirement.Yet stagnant middle-class pay, combined with steep price increases for college, health care and homes, have made those expenses harder to afford. Median household income, adjusted for inflation, hasnt budged since 1996, according to the Census Bureau. Average college tuition has soared 174 percent in that time.Many of the formerly middle class are still struggling with student debt. McGahen, who has an MBA, estimates hell be making $600 payments on student loans each month for the next decade. Feldotte, with two masters degrees, says she has "lots and lots of debt."And she isnt prepared to help her children pay for college."Theres no money to help them," she said.Some people feel theyve fallen out of the middle class even as their incomes have remained stable, because their costs have risen. One is Richard Timmerman, 66, a retired postal employee in River Falls, Wis.Hes been living off his pension since retiring five years ago. His wife, a sales manager at a hotel and conference center, hasnt had a raise in that time. The recession hammered the hotels business, though its slowly recovering.Yet his cost of living has risen in the past decade or so. Gas prices have surged over that time. So has food. And only this year did the value of Timmermans retirement savings regain its level of six years ago."I see my position in the social structure having gone down a notch," Timmerman said. He considers himself lower-middle class, compared with middle class a few years ago.A slowly improving U.S. economy could lift some people back into the middle class. Still, the recession and slow recovery have left permanent scars.McGahen and his wife are trying to rebuild their savings. They no longer have credit cards. Timmerman travels much less than he thought he would in retirement."I have really beat myself up a lot over the last 2½ years," McGahen said. "Until I get myself up and going again and in a good place ... it is tough."___AP Writer Melissa Nelson in Pensacola, Fla. contributed to this report.___Follow Christopher S.

He is one of the reports authors along with Harvards Raj Chetty, Emmanuel Saez and Patrick Kline of the University of California, Berkeley, and Nicholas Turner of the Treasury Department.Worries have been growing across the political spectrum about an expanding divide between Americas rich and the rest: The top 1 percent of Americans accounted for 22.5 percent of income earned in the United States in 2012. That is one of the highest figures since the Roaring 20s and up from a low 8.9 percent in 1976, according to a database maintained by Saez.But the fact the top 1 percent are pulling away has had little effect on the ability of those in the bottom fifth to rise to the top fifth, the study found.The findings are open to different interpretations: They could suggest that government programs to help the poor have made little headway in increasing economic opportunity. Or they could suggest that economic advancement would have become harder without such programs."My concern is that there may be less mobility in the future," former White House economic adviser Alan Krueger said by email. The cost of a college education, for instance, is increasingly difficult for low- and middle-income families to afford.Hendren emphasizes that its still harder to move from poverty to affluence in the United States than in most other wealthy countries. In a 2012 study of 22 countries, economist Miles Corak of the University of Ottawa found that the United States ranked 15th for social mobility. Among wealthy countries. Only Italy and the Britain ranked lower."In some sense, how could it have gotten worse?" Hendren said. "Its not like were losing the American Dream. We never really had it."	2014-01-23

The gain suggests manufacturing is picking up after a weak start to the year.The Commerce Department says factory orders rose 2.1 percent last month. Aprils increase was revised higher to 1.3 percent from 1 percent.ADVERTISEMENTMost of the gain was due to a big jump in volatile commercial aircraft demand.Still, businesses also ordered more machinery, computers and household appliances. That helped boost a measure of business investment spending 1.5 percent. It was the third straight gain for that category, which excludes volatile aircraft and defense orders. And gain was stronger than a 1.1 percent increase estimated last week in a preliminary report on May long-lasting manufactured goods.Manufacturing has struggled this year after helping propel the economy in the first three years after the recession ended. U.S. factories have seen less demand for exports because of weaker global growth. And businesses reduced their investment in machinery and equipment in the first quarter.The increase in business spending follows another report that shows manufacturing activity picked up in June. The Institute for Supply Managements index of manufacturing activity rose to 50.9 from 49. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.The ISM index showed that new orders and production both jumped. But a gauge of employment fell sharply, suggesting factories cut jobs for the fourth straight month.The U.S. economy expanded at only a 1.8 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, the Commerce Department said this week. That was much slower than its previous estimate of a 2.4 percent rate.The main reason for the downgrade was consumers spent less on services than initially thought. Spending on long-lasting factory goods, such as cars and appliances, was stronger.Economists expect growth remained tepid in the April-June quarter. Most estimates range between a rate of 1.5 percent and 2 percent.	2013-07-02

Any reading above zero indicates expansion. Despite the decline, manufacturing in the region has grown for five straight months.ADVERTISEMENTA measure of new orders rose, pointing to healthier future growth. And factories continued to add jobs, albeit at a slower pace.The regional manufacturing report will receive more attention than usual because its one of the few available measures of the economy during the shutdown, which is now in its third week.

Low rates have helped drive the housing markets steady recovery.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate for the 30-year fixed loan rose to 3.57 percent from 3.54 percent last week. Thats near the 3.31 percent reached in November, which was the lowest on records dating to 1971.ADVERTISEMENTThe average rate on the 15-year fixed mortgage increased last week to 2.76 percent from 2.72 percent last week. The record low of 2.63 percent was also reached in November.The lowest mortgage rates in decades are spurring more home purchases and refinancing. Thats helped the broader economy. Increased sales are also pushing home prices higher.In February, sales of previously occupied homes rose to a seasonally adjusted pace of 4.98 million, the fastest in more than three years. And U.S. home prices rose 8.1 percent in January, the fastest annual rate since the peak of the housing boom in the summer of 2006.Fewer people signed contracts to buy homes in February. But the level stayed near a three-year high, leading many analysts to predict re-sales will keep rising in the coming months. Theres normally a one- to two-month delay between a signed contract and a completed sale.One concern remains the limited number of available homes for sale. That could slow sales at the start of the all-important spring-buying season.And some people are unable to take advantage of the low mortgage rates, either because they cant qualify for stricter lending rules or they lack the money for larger down payment requirements. First-time home buyers made up 30 percent of existing home sales in February, well below the 40 percent that is typical in a healthy market.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country on Monday through Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for 30-year mortgages was unchanged at 0.8 point. The fee for 15-year loans also was steady, at 0.7 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage slipped to 2.62 percent from 2.63 percent last week. The fee for one-year adjustable-rate loans edged down to 0.3 from 0.4 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage rose to 2.68 percent from 2.61 percent. The fee held at 0.6 point.	2013-03-28

Nordstroms shares fell more than 2 percent in after-hours trading.ADVERTISEMENTLuxury spending has rebounded since 2009, but Nordstrom is grappling with new demands from shoppers armed with smartphones and tablets. Thats pushing the department store, considered the gold standard in customer service, to redefine the term for a new era. It now offers free shipping for online shoppers and has rolled out mobile devices that allow shoppers at its regular stores and Rack outlets to check out anywhere in the store.With that rollout Nordstrom said its removing some of the traditional cash registers at its Rack stores in the current quarter, and it looks to phase out registers in favor of mobile checkout by next year.The latest developments come as online sales soared 31 percent in the fourth quarter and surpassed $1 billion for the first time. Within online, mobile commerce is getting hotter. In the past year, sales coming from mobile devices accounted for more than 20 percent of the companys total online sales. That was dramatically up from less than 4 percent in 2010."We aspire to be the retailer of choice wherever and whenever customers choose to shop with us," Blake Nordstrom, the retailers president, told investors during a conference call after the earnings report was released. "And we understand that our customers definition of services (is) changing."The Seattle-based retailers net income for the three months ended Feb. 2 rose to $284 million, or $1.40 per share, from $236 million or $1.11 per share a year ago. That beat analysts expectations of $1.35 per share.Revenue rose 13 percent to $3.7 billion, which matched analysts expectations.Overall revenue in stores open at least a year rose by 6.3 percent. The measure is a key gauge of a retailers financial health because it excludes stores that opened or closed during the year.That metric rose 2.2 percent at its department stores.Nordstrom Rack, which opened 15 stores in fiscal 2012, continued to show strong sales growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue at stores opened at least a year rose 7.1 percent for the Rack, which is its largest fourth-quarter increase in the past six years.For the full year net income rose 8 percent to $735 million, or $3.56 per share, from $683 million, or $3.14 per share.Revenue rose 12 percent to $12.1 billion from $11.76 billion a year ago.For the upcoming fiscal year, Nordstrom expects net income of $3.65 to $3.80 per share on revenue up 4.5 percent to 6.5 percent.

The Commerce Department releases durable goods for February on Wednesday, March 26, 2014. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Orders to U.S. factories for long-lasting manufactured goods rose in February by the most in three months, but a key category that reflects business investment fell sharply. This category fell 1.3 percent, the second setback in three months.Economists said the weakness in business investment might reflect the severe winter, which led some industries to put modernization and expansion plans on hold.ADVERTISEMENTOverall orders for durable goods rose 2.2 percent after a 1.3 percent drop in January, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The February increase was driven by a surge in orders for commercial aircraft, a category that tends to fluctuate sharply from month to month.Joel Naroff, chief economists at Naroff Economic Advisors, said he expected economic growth to slow sharply in the January-March quarter, reflecting the disruptions caused by the harsh weather, before recovering in coming months."The rebound could be huge once spring actually appears," Naroff said.A 13.6 percent jump in demand for commercial aircraft followed a 22.1 percent plunge in the previous month. Orders for motor vehicles and parts showed a solid gain of 3.6 percent in February after a 1.9 percent fall in January.Demand also rose for primary metals such as steel. Orders for machinery fell 1.5 percent. Demand for computers fell 0.5 percent and for communications equipment 2.7 percent.Many economists think manufacturing output will strengthen in spring, reflecting better weather after winter storms disrupted production at some factories.The Institute for Supply Managements gauge of manufacturing activity expanded faster in February as companies received more orders and boosted their stockpiles. Its manufacturing index rose to 53.2 in February from 51.3 in January. That only partially reversed a 5-point drop in January. Any reading above 50 indicates that manufacturing is expanding.The ISM index had risen for six straight months until falling slightly in December and taking a big tumble in January as heavy snow caused factories to close.The bad weather depressed purchases of homes and autos, causing factories to trim their production schedules for autos, furniture and appliances in January. But the Federal Reserve said factory output rebounded in February by the largest amount in six months.Analysts estimate that the economy slowed to an annual growth rate below 2 percent in the January-March period. But theyre forecasting that the growth rate will rebound to around 3 percent for the rest of the year. If that occurs, it would be the fastest annual economic growth since 2005.	2014-03-26

(AP Photo/Toby Talbot, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Businesses spent less last month on machinery, computers and most other items, lowering orders for U.S. long-lasting factory goods. The decline suggests companies may have been reluctant to invest during the 16-day partial government shutdownThe Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders for durable goods dropped 2 percent in October from September. That follows a 4.1 percent increase in September from August.ADVERTISEMENTDurable goods are meant to last at least three years.Demand for commercial aircraft plunged nearly 16 percent last month, accounting for much of the decline. But orders also fell 1.2 percent in a closely watched category that excludes volatile transportation and defense orders. That was the second straight drop.Economists pay closer attention to core capital goods because those orders can reflect businesses confidence in the economy.Many companies may have held off placing orders in October, awaiting the outcome of a budget impasse that shut down parts of the federal government.However, the report conflicts with a private sector survey released earlier this month that showed companies shrugged off the shutdown and boosted orders.The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group, said factory activity accelerated for the fifth straight month in October to the fastest pace in 2 ½ years. The surveys measure of new orders ticked up and production remained strong, though it slowed from the previous month.Other reports have suggested that manufacturing has picked up since the spring. Strong auto sales and a healthier housing market have pushed up demand for steel and other metals, auto parts, furniture and appliances.And factory output rose for the third straight month in October, according to the Federal Reserve, driven higher by greater production of primary metals and furniture.Overseas demand for many goods has also risen as Europe has climbed out of recession, Japan is growing faster and Chinas economy has slowed but is still growing at a healthy pace.Changes in aircraft demand can frequently push the overall figure up or down. Aircraft orders soared 59 percent in September, accounting for most of the total increase in orders that month.Boeing says it received orders for 79 planes last month, down from 127 in September.	2013-11-27

Weak productivity suggests that companies may have to hire because they cant squeeze more work from their existing employees — that is, if demand for a companys products is growing.Productivity growth has been weaker recently, rising 1.5 percent in 2012 and 0.5 percent in 2011.Annual productivity growth averaged 3.2 percent in 2009 and 3.3 percent in 2010. In records dating back to 1947, its been about 2 percent.The economy so far hasnt been growing fast enough to fuel a hiring spree. Growth came in at a lackluster 1.1 percent annual rate from January through March and a still-weak 1.7 percent annual rate from April through June. The economy has been pinched by tax increases, federal spending cuts and weakness overseas. Economists expect U.S. growth to pick up in the second half of 2013 as the effects of the tax increases and budget cuts begin to fade."Companies will have to start to increase their work force and start hiring more aggressively should the upward trend in the economy continue," Annalisa Piazza, an analyst at Newedge Strategy, wrote in a note to clients.The economy has added 192,000 jobs a month so far this year, on average, a modest improvement on last years average 183,000 new jobs a month.For now, the modest rise in labor costs means wages arent growing fast enough to raise worries about inflation.The Federal Reserve monitors productivity and labor costs for any signs that inflation could pick up. Mild inflation has allowed the Fed to keep short-term interest rates at record lows and to buy bonds to try to keep long-term rates down.	2013-08-16

The report noted that the shutdown did not affect total jobs.ADVERTISEMENTEmployers also added 60,000 more jobs in the previous two months than earlier estimated.The figures suggest hiring has picked up in the fall. Employers added an average of 202,000 jobs from August through October, up from 146,000 from May through July.The percentage of Americans working or looking for work fell to a fresh 35-year low.

WASHINGTON –  The U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply in December because oil imports plummeted and total exports rose. The smaller trade gap means the economy likely performed better in the final three months of last year than first estimated last week.The Commerce Department says the trade deficit fell nearly 21 percent in December, to $38.6 billion, the smallest in nearly three years.ADVERTISEMENTExports rose 2.1 percent to $186.4 billion. Exports of oil and other petroleum products rose to the highest level on record.Imports shrank 2.7 percent to $224.9 billion. Oil imports plunged to 223 billion barrels, the lowest since February 1997.A narrower trade gap boosts growth because it means U.S. companies earned more from overseas sales while consumers and businesses spent less on foreign products.	2013-02-08

That made a difference in a quarter during which revenue barely grew.ADVERTISEMENTCEO Gary Kelly said Thursday that demand is still suffering from automatic federal spending cuts that have reduced government travel and from higher taxes, but he said third-quarter trends "are encouraging."The companys revenue per mile — a closely watched figure in the industry — has been about 3 percent higher this month than in July 2012, and bookings for August and September "also look solid," he said.Southwest officials declined to comment Thursday on the investigation into an accident this week at New Yorks LaGuardia Airport.The National Transportation Safety Board is trying to determine why the nose gear of a Southwest Boeing 737 collapsed upon landing Monday night, causing the plane to skid off the runway with its nose on the ground. Several passengers and flight attendants were treated for injuries.After the financial report was released but before the opening bell at the stock market, Southwest shares fell 31 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $13.45. Through Wednesday, the shares were up 34 percent for the year, nearly the same as the rise in the Arca index of airline stocks.The stocks have rallied as investors grow more confident about sustained profits in an industry that lost billions last decade. Mergers have reduced competition, the airlines have curtailed flights to push up fares, and theyve added revenue from a flock of fees for various services.Southwest Airlines Co., which owns AirTran Airways, said that second-quarter net income was $224 million, or 31 cents per share, down 2 percent from $228 million, or 30 cents per share, a year ago.Southwest said that stripping away special items — mostly changes in the value of fuel-hedging bets — it would have earned 38 cents per share in the latest quarter. Thats a penny better than analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting.Revenue increased less than 1 percent to $4.64 billion. Southwest said that was a second-quarter record, but it fell short of analysts forecasts of $4.66 billion.Traffic increased about 3 percent, and the average one-way fare rose less than a buck — to $151.23. The rate of fare increases has slowed from 2011, when airlines raised prices quickly to offset higher fuel costs.Southwest and AirTran added flights in the quarter, so the average plane was 81.6 percent full, down slightly from 81.9 percent a year earlier. But capacity in June hit a record 85 percent as the summer vacation season hit full stride.Lower oil prices early in the April-to-June quarter helped Southwest save 6 percent on fuel, its biggest expense, and the company cut maintenance spending by 3 percent, or $10 million. But labor, the second-biggest expense, rose 6 percent, or $76 million.Kelly said the company was on schedule to repaint AirTran planes in Southwest colors and combine the two carriers by the end of next year.

(AP /Elaine Thompson)The federal government’s latest mixed signal on pot stems from Maine, where a medical marijuana dispensary has settled charges alleging violations of the National Labor Relations Act and the rights of its employees.The National Labor Relations Board agreed to hear claims of union-busting at the Wellness Connection of Maine, and although the case was settled first, the boards willingness to hear it was yet another tacit acknowledgement of the industry’s legitimacy. Although the federal government considers pot illegal, whether for recreational or medical use, new state laws legalizing it have forced federal authorities to address a variety of conflicts. Notably, the Justice Department has agreed to help banks — barred by money laundering statutes from working with drug dealers — find a way to do business with marijuana merchants in Colorado and Washington.ADVERTISEMENT“The conflict is federal labor law, which has a broad definition of employees, and we have to accommodate that with federal criminal law, which makes working with marijuana a crime,” said Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, a professor of labor and employment law at Indiana University. “That is some recognition that federal law may give these employees rights even though federal law may also say what they’re doing is illegal.”- Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, professor of labor and employment law, Indiana UniversityDau-Schmidt said federal courts and agencies such as the NLRB face a "quandary" because federal laws are in conflict. The workers right to organize must be protected, but in this case they are employed in an industry the federal government deems illegal. Asked if cases like these will force the government’s hand regarding medical marijuana, Dau-Schmidt declined to speculate “too far” into the future, but added that similar issues in other arenas are likely to arise.“This is going to crop up not only in banking, labor, employment law, tax issues,” he said. “I’m sure you’re going to see similar conflicts in other areas.”Matt LaMourie, an attorney who represented Wellness Connection, confirmed to FoxNews.com that a settlement had been reached between the Maine firm and the NLRB, adding that the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) had “blessed” all terms of the undisclosed agreement. The union, which the workers had sought to join, voluntarily withdrew 21 of 29 unfair labor practice charges it filed against the company last year, LaMourie said.The independent agency’s role in the case doesn’t show some level of federal recognition of the medical marijuana industry, he said.“My sense is the NLRB is going to evaluate cases brought to them on a case-by-case basis,” LaMourie told FoxNews.com. “I don’t think this represents some sweeping mandate, not at all … This isn’t a victory for the union by any stretch of the imagination.”UFCW officials, meanwhile, said the allegations began last February, when workers from an Auburn cultivation site led a walkout in protest of the company’s unlawful practice of applying pesticides. The NLRB was then prepared to issue a complaint related to interrogation and solicitation to oppose the union.The UFCW, which represents more than 1.3 workers in the retail, meatpacking, food processing and poultry industries, also represents thousands of medical marijuana workers in six states and the District of Columbia. Those members primarily work in dispensaries, coffee shops, bakeries and growing/training facilities. In 2009, medical marijuana dispensaries were legalized in Maine and Wellness Connection serves as the state’s largest medical marijuana distributor.“Only by sticking together, we were able to find the strength to speak out about the gross violations that we saw at work,” Jenifer Moody, a former Wellness employee included in the charges, said in a statement. “By fighting for our union, we are protecting our customers and shaping the medical marijuana industry into a safe and well-regulated industry that provides good jobs and needed medicine for our community. I am proud of what we workers have done, and glad to see the NLRB validate our charges against this company.”Evan Yeats, a spokesman for the union, told FoxNews.com that the settlement speaks to the undeniable “fundamental rights” to all U.S. citizens.“What it’s saying is that regardless of the industry you work in, American workers have fundamental rights,” he said. “And that includes the right to stick together and speak as a group.”	2014-03-05

But Richard Lewis, who reluctantly took over the family business in 1959 and brought dignity and grace to countless bereaved Nantucket families over the next half-century, was retiring. No one in the family was willing to take over the islands solemn duty, and no outsiders were interested in buying it.ADVERTISEMENT"It simply wasnt a great investment for a funeral home," Carmen Bennett, a descendant of the business founder, told FoxNews.com, citing the increased popularity of less lucrative cremations.- Carmen Bennett on how her father operated the funeral homeFor Lewis, now 80, making money was never the main concern. He was a Marine, married with two children and living in Cherry Point, N.C., when both of his parents died within a short span. When his grandfather called him to say the family business needed him, Lewis deferred his dreams of independence like Jimmy Stewarts George Bailey in the classic "Its a Wonderful Life" and began serving the small community where hed grown up."He would get everything organized even if he knew the person could never afford a funeral," Bennett said. "If a family lost a child, hed refuse any payment at all. He figured they already lost so much already."This time, there was no one to step in and keep the funeral home going on the small, crescent-shaped spit of sand about 35 miles off the coast of Massachusetts. Bennetts daughter showed interest, but she is caring for a baby who was a heart-transplant recipient and could not devote the time needed to attend embalming school. This fall, the family began preparing to close up shop on Dec. 6, and the town of Nantucket began exploring a wide array of contingency plans for dealing with its deaths. The patchwork solution they came up with wont replace Richard Lewis, but it will help bring peace to the departed.The John Lawrence Funeral Home, on the mainland in Marston Mills, Mass., has agreed to station a fully equipped hearse on the island, The Inquirer and Mirror reported. The funeral home will train an island-based staff that can respond when needed. The Nantucket Cottage Hospital also installed a new refrigerated morgue to accommodate the community. Bonnie Kester, the chief nursing officer and vice president of patient care, said hospital officials worked with community leaders and the state Department of Public Health. The new procedures will apply to those seeking a mainland burial, cremation and families interested in a loved one being embalmed, she said. The island still maintains active cemeteries and residents are not required to utilize the services.Since the Lewis Funeral Home closed its doors, the community had three deaths. Kester said the new procedures in place worked as planned. "Our main objective is to make sure the families and the deceased have dignity in the process," she said.The kind of dignity Lewis brought to islander Richard Decker last year, when he died at the age of just 29, according to his sister, Sara Decker. The Nantucket Department of Public Works employee had sailed to Hyannis for last-minute Christmas shopping when he went to sleep in his hotel room and never woke up."It was heart failure," Sara Decker said, recalling how Lewis handled her brothers arrangements with sensitivity and sympathy. "Im just grateful what happened, happened last year; I dont know what we would do now."Theres something to be said for the community feel, especially when you need it….thats for sure," she added.The Associated Press contributed to this report	2013-12-15

Lebanon, Pa. Freddie Mac reports on mortgage rates for this week on Thursday, May 16, 2013. T (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Average U.S. rates on fixed mortgages rose this week but stayed near their historic lows. Cheaper mortgages have helped the economy by spurring more home-buying and refinancing.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate for the 30-year loan increased to 3.51 percent from 3.42 percent last week. Thats still near the average of 3.31 percent reached in November, the lowest on records dating to 1971.ADVERTISEMENTThe average on the 15-year loan rose to 2.69 percent. Thats up from 2.61 percent last week, which was the lowest on records going back to 1991.Low mortgage rates have helped sustained the housing recovery that began last year. Home sales and construction are up from a year ago, and prices are rising in most U.S. markets.Home prices are rising in part because more buyers are bidding on a limited supply of homes for sale.On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. builders started fewer homes in April than March. But most of the decline was in apartment construction, which tends to vary sharply from month to month.And applications for new construction reached a five-year peak last month. That suggests the housing revival will be sustained.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country on Monday through Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for 30-year mortgages was unchanged from last week at 0.7 point. The fee for 15-year loans also was steady at 0.7.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage rose to 2.55 percent from 2.53 percent last week. The fee for one-year adjustable-rate loans remained at 0.4 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage increased to 2.62 percent from 2.58 percent. The fee was unchanged at 0.5 point.	2013-05-16

But nearly half the growth came from a buildup in business stockpiles, a trend that could reverse in the current quarter and hold back growth.The Commerce Departments second estimate of third-quarter growth was much higher than the initial 2.8 percent rate reported last month. And it was well above the 2.5 percent growth rate for the April-June quarter.ADVERTISEMENTBut almost the entire third-quarter revision came from a big jump in stockpiles. Consumer spending, the lifeblood of the economy, was the weakest in nearly four years.When excluding inventories, the economy grew at a 1.9 percent rate in the third quarter, down from 2.1 percent in the spring.	2013-12-05

The problem became especially severe after housing prices crashed around the time of the 2008 financial crisis and the number of foreclosures soared.Because of the settlement, banks cut the size of mortgage balances, modified loans and allowed homeowners to sell their house for less than they owed. It also let some borrowers refinance even though they wouldnt usually qualify because they owed too much.The settlement with the federal government and 49 states "resulted in an unprecedented amount of consumer relief," monitor Joseph Smith wrote. He said the deal gave banks an incentive to provide relief early, so borrowers who were in trouble got help within 18 months of the effective date of the settlement.The $50 billion in relief counts as $20 billion under the scoring system of the settlement. Lenders got a bonus of 25 percent for mortgages reduced before Feb. 28, 2013, and penalties if they missed deadline. Other variables also increased or decreased the amount they were credited with.According to the report, Bank of America was credited with $9.61 billion in relief, covering 317,028 loans; Wells Fargo provided $4.57 billion on 122,719 loans; Chase provided $4.46 billion on 125,553 loans, and Citi provided $1.79 billion, covering 58,822 loans.Chase said it finished its loan changes two years early and forgave an average of $121,000 in principal on first mortgages.Wells Fargo said the loans it was credited with changing were "only a small percentage of what we have done to assist customers over the past several years. We remain committed to helping customers who face payment challenges find options wherever possible."Smith said he is continuing to monitor some mortgage-servicing practices under separate agreements those companies have with some states. He said he will file another report in the spring.	2014-03-18

The larger trade deficit could dampen economic growth in the current July-September quarter.The Commerce Department says the trade gap rose 13 percent to $39.1 billion. Thats up from Junes $34.5 billion, the smallest since 2009.ADVERTISEMENTImports increased 1.6 percent to $228.6 billion, as oil and auto shipments rose. Exports slipped 0.6 percent to $189.4 billion, down from a record high in June.Junes lower deficit helped boost overall economic growth to a 2.5 percent annual in the April-June quarter. A wider deficit could hold back third-quarter growth because it means companies are selling fewer goods overseas while importing more foreign-made products.	2013-09-04

Inflation remains low across the broader economy, giving the Federal Reserve latitude to continue its extraordinary stimulus program.The Labor Department says the consumer price index was unchanged last month, after dropping 0.1 percent in October.ADVERTISEMENTGas prices declined 1.6 percent in November to keep overall prices down.

That is significantly below the Feds inflation target of 2 percent.Excluding volatile energy and food costs, core prices rose 0.2 percent in November from October and just 1.7 percent over the past 12 months.Prices for new vehicles and clothing fell.

Comcast reports quarterly earnings on Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2014.(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)The Associated PressPHILADELPHIA –  Comcast Corp. added 43,000 video subscribers in the fourth quarter — the first quarterly gain in six and a half years — as the nations top cable TV company said that uptake of its X1 set-top box helped it retain customers and boost video-on-demand spending.The company also said Tuesday that it has hiked its share buyback authority and is raising its quarterly dividend. Its shares rose in morning trading.ADVERTISEMENTNet income in the three months through December rose 26 percent to $1.91 billion, or 72 cents per share, from $1.52 billion, or 56 cents per share a year ago. However, the increase was partly due to a one-time tax windfall of $158 million.Excluding the tax gain, earnings per share came to 66 cents, slightly below the 68 cents per share expected by analysts polled by FactSet.Revenue rose 6 percent to $16.93 billion, beating the $16.65 billion expected by analysts.Philadelphia-based Comcast is rolling out its X1 platform to new customers who sign up for at least three services — Internet, video and voice — and to other top customers where it has supplies. The set-top box allows users to navigate a slick interface like a website which can be controlled through mobile device apps and gives access to more content delivered via the Web. For the upcoming Winter Olympics from Sochi, for example, Comcast is bringing the breadth of NBCs live online coverage to big screen TVs for the first time through the X1 platform.The company is likely to caution against too much optimism for a turnaround in video, however.Cable operators have been losing market share to rival telecoms and satellite competitors for years, and fourth-quarter results are generally boosted by college students re-hooking up TVs as they start school and by higher TV use during cold winter months. For the full year, Comcast still lost 305,000 video customers to end the year with 21.7 million.It added 379,000 Internet customers to finish the year with 20.7 million.Overall cable revenue rose 5 percent to $10.66 billion in the fourth quarter.NBCUniversal posted a 7 percent gain in revenue to $6.46 billion, helped by bigger audiences for broadcast network NBC, which has been bolstered by hits "The Voice," The Blacklist" and "Sunday Night Football" from the NFL.The company said it is boosting its share buyback authorization to $7.5 billion — up from $1.5 billion authorized currently — with $3 billion to be spent in 2014. It raised its quarterly dividend by 15 percent to 22.5 cents per share.In morning trading, Comcast shares rose $1.07, or 2 percent, to $53.56. Its shares are up more than 35 percent over the past year.	2014-01-28

The percentage increase was the largest in nearly 20 years.ADVERTISEMENTSteady job creation and near record-low mortgage rates are spurring more Americans to buy houses. At the same time, the number of previously occupied homes for sale is at a 13-year low. That shortage creates more demand for new homes.Still, the increases are coming from depressed levels. New-home sales plummeted to a record low in 2011. And sales are still well below the 700,000 annual level that economists consider healthy.	2013-02-26

The Army, after hitting a high of 570,000 service members during the Iraq war, is being reduced to 490,000. If across-the-board spending cuts remain in place, the Army may have to cut an additional 110,000, which would give it the smallest number of active-duty members since before World War II.ADVERTISEMENT- Jamie Dimon, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. chief executive"This challenge is going to multiply," Hagel said at the beginning of the Friday meeting with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon as well as executives from Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of America Corp. and others. They offered Hagel suggestions for how the military could better prepare service members for the civilian workforce.J.P. Morgan, which hosted the meeting, has led an effort by 123 companies begun in 2011 to hire veterans for 100,000 jobs, resulting in about 92,000 hires so far. Dimon said more should be done to reach out to other companies and try to hire many more."It is all coordination, real estate and training," Dimon said. "There are a million good ideas here."Dimon is negotiating a settlement with the Justice Department under which the company would pay $13 billion to end a number of civil investigations into its sale of mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Nonetheless, Hagels desire to meet with him indicates the bank is still viewed favorably by many within the administration.Eric Molina, a military veteran who works at J.P. Morgan Chase, suggested a program to allow service members to shadow workers in their chosen fields. That would help link the military to corporations interested in hiring veterans. More importantly, it also would introduce service members to mentors and ease the transition from military to civilian work, he said. "Get them out of a uniform, get them into a suit," he said. "That will bridge the cultural difference and will help both sides."Click for more from WSJ.com	2013-11-02

Thats the fastest pace in two years and up from an initial estimate of 1.9 percent. Labor costs dropped at a rate of 1.9 percent, more than the 0.1 percent dip initially estimated.ADVERTISEMENTProductivity was revised higher because economic growth was faster in the third quarter than first estimated, while hours worked were unchanged.

Weak productivity growth could prompt employers to hire more if consumers and businesses continue to increase spending.The Labor Department said Thursday that productivity rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.7 percent in the first quarter, after shrinking 1.7 percent in the previous quarter.ADVERTISEMENTLabor costs increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.5 percent, below the fourth quarters 4.4 percent gain.Productivity is the amount of output per hour of work. It increased because output rose at a faster pace than hours worked.The trend in productivity has been fairly weak in recent years. For all of 2012, productivity rose just 0.7 percent, after an even smaller 0.6 percent rise in 2011.Those gains were less than half the average growth in 2009 and 2010, shortly after many companies laid off workers to cut costs during the Great Recession. And its below the long-run trend of 2.2 percent growth a year dating back to 1947.With productivity growth slow, companies might have to add workers if demand for their products continue to grow. The economy expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate from January through March, up from just 0.4 percent in the previous quarter. The increase was mostly driven by the fastest consumer spending in more than two years.But most economists expect higher Social Security taxes have started to weigh on consumers. That should slow economic growth in the second and third quarters.The Federal Reserve closely monitors productivity and labor costs for any signs that inflation is affecting wages. Mild inflation has allowed the central bank to keep interest rates at record lows in an effort to boost economic growth and fight high unemployment.	2013-05-02

"I think were going to do some big things. Its not going to be easy. Not at all. We have to remain the hunters. But we do have a chip on our shoulders, too."Oddsmakers believe thats more of a boulder on their shoulder, and have installed Denver (tied No. 2, AP Pro32) as a 9-point favorite over Baltimore (No. 8, AP Pro32). The Ravens have had all kinds of offseason upheaval, particularly to the defense, which no longer has Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Dannell Ellerbe, Paul Kruger and Bernard Pollard.Its never wise to underestimate a defending champion, though.

That is the fourth straight drop and the lowest level in six months.ADVERTISEMENTThe sustained decline suggests companies are confident enough about future growth to keep their staffs. Applications are a proxy for layoffs. Greater business confidence can also lead to more hiring.The four-week average is now near its lowest level since October 2007, just two months before the recession began. It dropped to 305,000 in September, but only because computer glitches in California and other states artificially lowered the figures."The downward slide ... in the past month, following weather-related increases previously, signals a pickup" in March hiring, Sal Guatieri, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.About 3.3 million people received benefits in the week ending March 8, the latest data available. That was 43,000 fewer than the previous week.The steady drop in applications has made economists more optimistic about hiring in March. Several point out that applications have fallen to a level that is consistent with monthly job gains of more than 200,000.That would be a step up from February, when employers added 175,000 positions. And even Februarys gain was an improvement from the previous two months of paltry hiring. Cold winter weather in January and December shut down factories, kept consumers away from shops, and reduced home sales. Employers added 129,000 jobs in January and only 84,000 in December.The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent last month. But the tenth of a percentage point increase happened, in part, for a positive reason: more people entered the job market to look for work. Employers didnt immediately hire most of them, causing the unemployment rate to increase. But the fact that they started job hunting suggests they were optimistic about their prospects.Employers advertised more jobs in January, a separate government report said this month, suggesting that hiring will likely remain steady in the coming months.More jobs and income will be needed to spur better growth. For now, economists expect the bad weather contributed to weak growth of 1.5 percent to 2 percent at an annual rate in the January-March quarter. But as the weather improves, most analysts expect growth to rebound to near 3 percent.	2014-03-27

Economists had expected 60.5, according to research firm FactSet.ADVERTISEMENTIt was the highest reading since Novembers 71.5. Confidence has fallen since then as shoppers were worried about growing economic uncertainty.The consumer confidence indicator is watched closely because consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of U.S. economic activity.

California, Texas and Indiana reported the largest job gains.ADVERTISEMENTNationwide, hiring has been robust for the past four months. Employers added an average of 204,000 jobs from August through November, a strong pickup from early this year.The national unemployment rate fell to 7 percent last month, a five-year low.Still, the decline in state unemployment rates has occurred partly because many people have stopped looking for work. When people who are out of work stop looking for jobs, theyre no longer counted as unemployed. The unemployment rate can fall as a result.	2013-12-20

Thats still about five points higher than last fall, when sentiment fell during the government shutdown. The index was 82.5 in December.ADVERTISEMENTEconomists say that the figures suggest confidence didnt take a big hit during the harsh winter. That could bode well for spending as the weather improves.And Americans are more optimistic about the economy this year.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Average U.S. rates for fixed mortgages slipped this week as new data showed a decline in home prices in November and a drop in new homes sales last month.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for the 30-year loan fell to 4.32 percent from 4.39 percent last week. The average for the 15-year loan eased to 3.40 percent from 3.44 percent.ADVERTISEMENTMortgage rates have risen about a full percentage point since hitting record lows roughly a year ago. The increase was driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve would reduce its $85 billion a month in bond purchases. Deeming the economy to be gaining in strength, the Fed pushed ahead Wednesday with a plan to reduce the bond purchases, which have kept long-term interest rates low.Data issued this week suggested a pause in the housing markets recovery. Home prices fell slightly in November as colder weather slowed buying, ending nine straight months of price gains, the Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index released Tuesday showed.The Commerce Department reported Monday that sales of new homes fell in December for a second straight month. Even with the end-year decline, though, home sales for 2013 climbed to the highest level in five years as they benefited from historically low mortgage rates.Most economists expect home sales and prices to keep rising this year, but at a slower pace. They forecast sales and prices will likely rise around 5 percent, down from double-digit gains in 2013.The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that fewer Americans signed contracts to buy previously occupied homes last month. Cold weather stalled home purchases.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged at 0.7 point. The fee for a 15-year loan declined to 0.6 point from 0.7 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage edged up to 2.55 percent from 2.54 percent. The fee slipped to 0.4 point from 0.5 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage fell to 3.12 percent from 3.15 percent. The fee was steady at 0.5 point.	2014-01-30

The Federal Reserve reports how much consumers borrowed in November on Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2014. (AP Photo/Andrew A. Nelles, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Americans increased their borrowing in November, led by continued gains in auto and student loans.The Federal Reserve said consumers increased their borrowing by $12.3 billion in November to a seasonally adjusted $3.09 trillion. That is a record level and follows an October increase of $17.9 billion.ADVERTISEMENTAlmost all of the November increase came from an $11.9 billion rise in borrowing for auto loans and student loans. Borrowing in the category that covers credit cards ticked up only $457.8 million after surging in October.Credit card borrowing plunged after the Great Recession and consumers remain cautious about taking on high-interest debt. It has gradually increased to its highest level in more than three years, but its still 16 percent below its peak of more than $1 trillion reached in 2008.The combination of weak hiring and meager wage gains has left many Americans reluctant to charge their purchases.Through November, the measure of auto loans and student loans has risen 8.2 percent from a year ago and has increased in every month but one since May 2010. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York quarterly report on consumer credit shows student loan debt has been the biggest driver of borrowing since the Great Recession officially ended in June 2009.But consumers are starting to open their wallets, even if they have resisted using credit cards. Auto sales ended the year strongly, while other purchases have picked up.Consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in November, the biggest increase in five months, according to the Commerce Department. That solid showing suggests solid economic growth in the final three months of 2013.The Feds borrowing report tracks credit card debt, auto loans and student loans but not mortgages, home equity loans and other loans.	2014-01-08

That topped an earlier $35 per-share offer from Kohlberg & Co.ADVERTISEMENTSteinway will discard its sales agreement with Kohlberg and pay a termination penalty of about $6.7 million.The sale price was music to the ears of investors and shares of Steinway Musical Instruments Inc. jumped nearly 6 percent in early trading.Steinway has been in business for 160 years. Its pianos have been a status symbol and a must-have luxury in concert halls for more than a century, but the company suffered during the recession. Sales have increased in the past few years, but have yet to return to their pre-recession levels.In June, the company finalized the sale of its flagship showroom in Manhattan, the legendary Steinway Hall, where Serge Rachmaninoff and Vladimir Horowitz, among other greats, once took grand pianos for a test ride.Industry watchers believe that the recovering economy, coupled with increased overseas demand from places like China, made the company more attractive to private investors. Its shares have recovered with the prospect of a sale, rising 71 percent this year.Steinway Chairman and CEO Michael Sweeney said Paulsons offer reflects the attractive value of Steinways heritage and growth potential, while also providing its shareholders with significantly better returns.Paulson does not have a specific clause that would allow the company to seek other bids, but Steinway can respond to unsolicited offers. It would, however, be required to pay about $13.4 million to break off the sales agreement.The deal is expected to close in late September.Steinway, which will become private, valued the sale at about $512 million. Paulson will open a tender offer for company shares within the next five days.Steinway & Sons was founded in 1853 by German immigrant Henry Engelhard Steinway in a Manhattan loft. Steinway was a master cabinet maker who built his first piano in the kitchen of his home in Germany, according to the company.During the ensuing three decades, Steinway and his sons developed the modern piano. The companys products now include Bach Stradivarius trumpets, Selmer Paris saxophones, C.G. Conn French horns, Leblanc clarinets, King trombones, Ludwig snare drums and Steinway & Sons pianos.	2013-08-14

It was the lowest trade gap since the final three months of 2010.ADVERTISEMENTThe current account is the broadest measure of trade. It tracks the sale of merchandise and services between nations as well as investment flows. Economists watch the current account as a sign of how much the United States needs to borrow from foreigners.Many economists predict the deficit will widen in coming quarters, in part because a global slowdown is dampening demand for American exports.	2012-12-18

The annual percentage of cars and trucks sent to the scrap yard has dropped 50 percent since the recession, he said."Cars are just lasting longer," he said.The company doesnt see the age dropping for at least five years, even though U.S. vehicle sales are running at an annual rate of around 15.5 million, which is near pre-recession levels. And it predicts that the percentage of cars age 12 or older will actually rise in the next five years.The change creates a big opportunity for repair shops and auto-parts stores, Seng said."Customers from independent and chain repair shops should be paying close attention to their business plans and making concerted efforts to retain business among the do-it-for-me audience, while retailers have a unique and growing opportunity with potential consumers wrenching on their own vehicles," he said.U.S. sales have risen gradually from a 30-year low of 10.4 million in 2009 because of low interest rates, appealing new models and pent-up demand as people replace aging vehicles they kept through the recession. The sales rebound prompted Polk to raise its estimate of the total number of vehicles on U.S. roads by 5 percent to more than 260 million in five years.But Seng said many people intend to keep running their older cars into the future, adding that he cant remember another time that the average age has grown as quickly.The growth rate in the average age will slow in the coming years, but wont start falling until new-car sales rise and stay high for several years. Older vehicles would have to be scrapped at a higher rate, as well, he said."With the quality of the vehicles, thats not going to happen," Seng said.More people also are financing cars for 72 months, meaning theyll keep their cars for at least six years and probably longer, Seng said.	2013-08-06

It was the best showing since June.

Wages and salaries, the most important component of income, rose a solid 0.4 percent. The gain reflected strength in the private sector and a modest gain in government pay.Consumer spending is closely followed because it accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.

The steep revision was largely because U.S. companies exported more goods and imports declined.The Commerce Department said second-quarter growth was sharply higher than the initial 1.7 percent rate it reported last month. And the growth this spring was more than double the 1.1 percent rate from January through March.ADVERTISEMENTThe improvement in the trade deficit helped offset a weaker government spending.Economists expect growth will stay at the 2.5 percent rate in the second half of the year, helped by steady job gains and less drag from federal spending cuts.

The trade gap with China also hit an all-time high.The Commerce Department says the trade deficit grew 4.8 percent in October from September to $42.2 billion.ADVERTISEMENTExports dropped 3.6 percent to $180.5 billion. Sales of commercial aircraft, autos and farm products all declined.Imports fell 2.1 percent to $222.8 billion, reflecting fewer shipments of cell phones, autos and machinery.A wider trade deficit acts as a drag on growth. It typically means the U.S. is earning less on overseas sales of American-produced goods while spending more on foreign products.	2012-12-11

Residents in some small Washington counties will only have two plans to choose from in the exchange. People in larger counties will have several options available. Still, officials were pleased with the selection."This is the first time that many Washingtonians will be able to shop for quality health care coverage," said Richard Onizuka, CEO for Washington Healthplanfinder, in a statement. "These brand new coverage options will enable residents to find the important health care services they need at costs that best fit their budget."The board had delayed certification until Wednesday as the state insurance commissioner worked with companies to fix proposals in order to meet all requirements. Board chair Margaret Stanley said the goal was to offer as many plans to consumers as possible.Washington may see eight additional multi-state plans if they are certified by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.Even though the purchasing process wont begin until next month, the health exchange has already opened a call center to field calls from the public. Potential customers are able to talk with people about the available plan choices, costs and potential subsidies.An estimated 1 million Washington residents are uninsured, or about 1 in 7 people who live in the state. Officials dont know the total number who might buy health insurance through the exchange, but the Insurance Commissioners office expects an estimated 328,000 people in Washington to benefit from the expansion in Medicaid coverage.Under the plans approved by the board, rates vary based on factors like age, home county, smoking habits and choice of plan.	2013-09-04

"Unless we act now, students returning to school this week will continue to face cuts in the classroom."Kitzhaber has been trying for months to reach a deal that would raise revenue to boost funding for schools and mental health treatment while lowering the cost of public employee pensions. Kitzhaber said hes also committed to including support for small businesses — a key demand from Senate Republicans.Kitzhaber said hes meeting with House and Senate leaders from both parties this week in hopes of securing a deal that would lower long-term pension costs by $5 billion and secure $200 million in new revenue.Senate President Peter Courtney, a Salem Democrat, said hell work as hard as he can to find a compromise that can win passage."Theres a lot at stake.

Just last month that city stopped payment on unsecured debt in an attempt to “conserve cash” for the police and fire departments and other city services. But the citys collision course with insolvency has created business opportunities for some and spurred a sense of civic pride for others.ADVERTISEMENTTom Nardone is the leader of "The Mower Gang," a growing group of volunteers who cut the grass at city parks. The business consultant and former analyst with Ford Motor Co. mounted his riding lawnmower and went to work when the cash-strapped city was on the brink of shutting down parks because there was no room in the budget for upkeep.“I was looking for some sort of volunteer work when the city announced that they were closing 72 parks,” Nardone, 48, told FoxNews.com.  “I wondered at the time what exactly that meant and found out that when the park is closed, it basically means that they stop with the upkeep. They are basically abandoned.”- Tom Nardone, leader of Detroits "Mower Gang"Working alone, Nardone started out just mowing under swing sets. But an army of inspired volunteers has joined the Mower Gang, allowing it to take on bigger and bigger projects, including a bicycle track that had been shut down and neglected since the 1980s. The Mower Gang, which has received equipment donations from Husqvarna, now maintains 15 city parks, helping to reclaim recreation space for kids and grownups alike.“When we get there [to a park], people are happy to see us, especially the kids,” Nardone said. “This isn’t a problem solver, but it’s a solution that helps.”When Andy Didorosi read in the newspaper that budget cuts had made a casualty out of a long planned light-rail project, the lifelong Motor City resident wasnt sad. He was angry.“I was pissed. I said, ‘I’ll make the corridor,’” Didorosi, 26, told FoxNews.com. "I was an asset liquidator at the time and had recently bought some buses anyway. I’ve always been a gearhead.”He started the Detroit Bus Company. The initial goal was to provide reliable routes in the city, mainly along the main artery of Woodward Avenue, where the light rail had been proposed. He also thought it made sense to establish a route to and from Detroit airport, something the city had provided, but poorly, according to Didorosi.“The only option is one bus that doesn’t run very often and stops on every corner,” said Didorosi, who hopes to get city approval for an express airport route next month. “It takes three hours to make a 45 minute commute. The city has missed out on holding conventions and we could possibly lose out on hosting the X Games because a lack of transportation.”The Detroit Bus Company currently runs charter services as well as scenic tours with six buses -- ranging from school buses to coach liners -- and provides free rides for kids to after-school programs and summer jobs.“Transportation is a public problem,” Didorosi said.” I don’t necessarily think that the system should be privatized, but I don’t see a better option than providing the services. Hopefully, everything will work itself out and the city will be back on track.”Ted ONeil, spokesman for the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy, said it remains to be seen if volunteers and entrepreneurs can save Detroit, but theyve already shown that what his organization refers to as "civil society" can succeed where government fails."The Center has defined civil society as a network of private institutions, community associations, schools and religious organizations, families, friends and co-workers, and all their voluntary, from-the-heart interactions that generally steps in when political society fails," ONeil said. "Without it, failing cities like Detroit would be in even more trouble."City officials declined to comment on the growing number of citizens chipping in where the municipal workforce comes up short. But it’s not just the Mower Gang and the Detroit Bus Company who are keeping the city running, with either entrepreneurial or voluntary efforts.Threat Management Center, a private security services firm founded in 1993, has seen business boom in recent years as police cutbacks drive residents and businesses to seek new ways of achieving security. Founder Dale Brown established the Violence Intervention Protective Emergency Response System (VIPERS), a civilian volunteer organization that has worked with police to reduce crime in troubled areas. Participants train at an academy run by Brown and now patrol some of the citys most dangerous neighborhoods, working with an increasingly lean police force to keep a lid on crime.Volunteers from the Rosedale Park Baptist Church board up and secure abandoned homes in the citys Brightmoor section, helping ensure that vacant buildings dont become drug shooting galleries or places for criminals to congregate. And more privatization could be on the way. The City Council has heard several proposals in recent months to privatize garbage collection and the water department.But saving a city with billions in debt, a crumbling infrastructure and crushing poverty may be too much for even the most civic-minded volunteers or entrepreneurs, said one expert. "Detroit is in desperate, desperate shape," said Peter Eisinger, professor emeritus of urban policy at New Yorks New School. "Detroit is a vast territory and 40 percent of it is empty. I dont see any of these efforts having any positive effects. Its a desperate, band-aid effort to make the city a little more livable for the people who stayed there."FoxNews.com’s Michael Roppolo and Michael Cipriano contributed to this story.  	2013-07-16

Charles Schumer seeks security upgrades at 1 World Trade Center tower after breaches	NEW YORK –  Sen. Charles Schumer stood by the World Trade Center on Sunday, demanding that federal officials review security after daredevils twice sneaked to the top of the sites signature, 104-story skyscraper.Schumers request comes after a teenager was charged with climbing to the top of the 1,776-foot spire of 1 World Trade Center, three skydiving enthusiasts turned themselves in to face charges in a September jump off the building, and a newspaper published a photo of a guard apparently sleeping on the job.ADVERTISEMENT"What is going on here?" asked Schumer.The New York Democrat wants the Department of Homeland Security to monitor the performance and training of trade center security guards, in addition to testing surveillance equipment and checking the perimeter for possible illegal entry points.Schumer said the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the 16-acre site, is responsible for any security breaches."Theyre the public authority in charge of this; Im holding them responsible," Schumer said during a news conference on Sunday.In a pair of statements Sunday, Port Authority security chief Joseph Dunne called the lapses "unacceptable" and invited Homeland Security officials to tour the site again "in light of recent security breaches."Dunne said the Port Authority and the Durst Organization, which manages 1 World Trade Center and provides private security for the building still under construction, "have taken significant steps" to address the lapses.David Velazquez, the assistant security director for Durst, resigned on Friday.Dunne noted that the two reported breaches are unrelated. "Each involved different means of accessing the site," he said, without elaborating.A "Phase 1" review of site security was submitted to DHS in November and is currently under review, Dunne said. A "Phase 2" application with measures including fences, closed-circuit television, perimeter patrol and access control is being prepared, he said.Schumer was not satisfied."I do not feel we can leave it up to the Port Authority to say, Oh, weve corrected it, never mind," the senator said. "There have been too many breaches."Schumer said hes pleased the New York Police Department is also participating in the security review and that Dunne, the PA security chief, is a former NYPD First Deputy Commissioner.The New York Post published a photo Wednesday that showed a guard in a bright-green security vest leaning back in a chair, legs crossed and head tilted back. A Durst Organization spokesman told the paper the guard was fired immediately.NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said the image of the sleeping guard is an "extraordinary embarrassment.""Youll see security levels enhanced significantly on that site," Bratton told WABC television on Sunday.The commissioner said police were looking for possible accomplices who may have helped the parachuters enter the high-rise."They didnt walk up," Bratton said. "They had assistance getting in and out of there, and were continuing our investigations as to who helped them get up there."	2014-03-30

Judge Steven Rhodes said Monday hell take up just a few issues.ADVERTISEMENTThe city wants the judge to suspend lawsuits or prevent new ones, especially in state court. An Ingham County judge last week ordered emergency manager Kevyn Orr and Gov. Rick Snyder to not take any more action in the bankruptcy case. Judge Rosemarie Aquilina also barred any moves that would hurt benefits already being received by pensioners.But city attorneys said federal bankruptcy law typically carries an "automatic stay" to give a debtor such as Detroit a "breathing spell" critical to protecting assets and restructuring debts. The lawyers said U.S. Bankruptcy Court is the only appropriate venue for anything related to the bankruptcy filing last Thursday.Without Rhodes intervention, opponents "will continue attempting to exert direct or indirect pressure on the city by commencing or continuing" lawsuits, Detroits attorneys said in a court filing.The Michigan Constitution says pensions for public employees "shall not be diminished or impaired." Detroit retirees claim any reduction would be illegal."I dont think the constitution should be made to be Swiss cheese. Once we erode it with one hole, there will be others," Aquilina said in her court Monday.Pension payments have not been frozen or reduced in the wake of the citys Chapter 9 filing. Snyder wants the bankruptcy judge to sort out pension issues, not Aquilina."Everythings on the table in terms of going through these issues in bankruptcy court. ... That could be one of those unfortunate things that comes out of this process," the governor told Detroit radio station WWJ, referring to smaller checks for current pensioners.___Eggert reported from Lansing, Mich.	2013-07-22

The gain suggests higher taxes have yet to slow consumer spending on services.The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that its index of non-manufacturing activity rose to 56 in February from 55.2 in January. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.ADVERTISEMENTThe report measures growth in industries that cover 90 percent of the work force, including retail, construction, health care and financial services.Service firms also kept adding jobs last month, although at a slightly slower pace than the previous month. A gauge of hiring dipped slightly after hitting a nearly seven-year high in January.Labor Department figures show solid hiring at service firms and construction companies, which the ISM includes in its measure of hiring. Those firms have added an average of 195,000 jobs from November through January.The government will release the February employment report on Friday.The increase in the service index also suggests consumers havent pared spending after Social Security taxes rose two percentage points Jan. 1. The companies surveyed by the ISM cover many industries that are closely tied to consumer spending, such as retail, hotels and restaurants and arts and entertainment. The higher payroll taxes cost a household earning $50,000 about $1,000 a year; a household with two high-paid workers will have up to $4,500 less.In January, consumers spent slightly more compared with the previous month, the government said last week. Most of the increase was in services, like utilities. They spent less on major purchases such as cars and appliances that signal confidence in the economy.There have been signs that Americans are willing to keep opening their wallets, despite higher taxes. Auto sales rose slightly in February after jumping the previous month. And measures of consumer confidence rebounded after plunging at the end of last year.The ISM reported last week that its separate index for manufacturing rose to its highest level since June 2011, driven higher by increases in new orders and production. That suggests manufacturing could boost growth this year after slumping in 2012.	2013-03-05

The gain offset a drop in key orders that signal business investment.The Commerce Department said Tuesday that factory orders increased 3 percent in February. Thats up 1 percent decline in January and the biggest gain in five months.ADVERTISEMENTThe increase was due mostly to a jump in orders for commercial aircraft. Those orders rose 95.1 percent. Orders for motor vehicles and parts also increased 1.4 percent.Orders for all durable goods, which are products expected to last at least three years, jumped 5.6 percent. Orders for nondurable goods, such as processed food and clothing, rose 0.8 percent.Despite the gains, the report showed that a key measure of business investment plans fell. That could mean that some companies were worried in February about steep federal spending cuts that started on March. 1.Core capital goods, which include machinery and equipment orders, fell 3.2 percent. Demand for construction machinery, turbines and generators all fell sharply. Orders for computers and electronic products rose slightly.Economists closely watch these orders because they signal business investment plans.Still, the decline followed a 6.7 percent surge in January, the largest in nearly three years. Analysts said that when averaging the two months, business investment orders showed a solid increase for the January-March quarter. Many expect the gains to resume this spring, helped by a stronger job market that has kept consumers spending.Consumers stepped up spending in February after their income jumped. The gain occurred even after Social Security taxes increased in January, reducing take-home pay for most Americans.Many economists raised their growth forecasts after the report was released. Some are predicting growth could increase to around 3 percent in the January-March quarter, up from 0.4 percent in the previous three months.Other data show that some companies may start to pull back because of the government spending cuts.The Institute for Supply Management reported Monday that U.S. manufacturing activity expanded more slowly in March than February, held back by weaker growth in production and new orders.But factories did hire at the fastest pace in nine months, which was seen as an encouraging sing ahead of Fridays report on employment in March.The economy has added an average of 200,000 jobs a month from November through February, which helped lower the unemployment rate in February to a four-year low of 7.7 percent.Economists predict a similar level of hiring in March.	2013-04-02
954	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/02/25/usda-spending-3m-to-feed-struggling-honeybees-in-midwest/	USDA spending $3M to feed struggling honeybees in Midwest	May 22, 2013: In this photo provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a queen Italian honeybee, the large bee just left of center, is surrounded on an apiary nest in Washington, D.C. The USDA hopes to help honeybees by providing $3 million to farmers and ranchers in five states to improve their pastures. It turns out that dairy cows and bees like many of the same plants.AP/USDAMILWAUKEE –  The U.S. Department of Agriculture will spend millions of dollars to help farmers and ranchers improve pastures in five Midwestern states to provide food for the nations struggling honeybees under a program to be announced Tuesday.Commercial honeybees pollinate an estimated $15 billion worth of produce each year. Many beekeepers bring hives to the Upper Midwest in the summer for bees to gather nectar and pollen for food, then truck them in the spring to California and other states to pollinate everything from almonds to apples to avocadoes.ADVERTISEMENTBut agricultural production has been threatened by a more than decade-long decline in commercial honeybees and their wild cousins due to habitat loss and pesticide use. Colony collapse disorder, in which honeybees suddenly disappear or die, has made the problem worse, boosting losses over the winter to as much as 30 percent per year.The USDA hopes to stem those losses by providing more areas for bees to build up food stores and strength for winter. The new program, details of which were provided to The Associated Press ahead of the announcement, will be "a real shot in the arm" for improving bees habitat and food supply, said Jason Weller, chief of USDAs Natural Resources Conservation Service.Dairy farmers and ranchers in Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Dakotas can qualify for about $3 million to reseed pastures with alfalfa, clover and other plants appealing to both bees and livestock. Farmers also can get help building fences, installing water tanks and making other changes that better enable them to move their animals from pasture to pasture so the vegetation doesnt become worn down. The goal is to provide higher quality food for insects and animals."Its a win for the livestock guys, and its a win for the managed honeybee population," Weller said. "And its a win then for orchardists and other specialty crop producers across the nation because then youre going to have a healthier, more robust bee population that then goes out and helps pollinate important crops."The USDA is focusing on those five states because 65 percent of the nations estimated 30,000 commercial beekeepers bring hives there for at least part of the year. With limited funds, Weller said, the goal is to get the biggest payoff for the investment.Corn, soybean and other farmers can qualify for money to plant cover crops, which typically go in after the regular harvest and help improve soil health, or to grow bee-friendly forage in borders and on the edges of fields.The program is just the latest in a series of USDA efforts to reduce honeybee deaths. The agency has partnered with universities to study bee diseases, nutrition and other factors threatening colonies. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack also recently created a working group on bees to coordinate efforts across the department.The work is already paying off with changes to once-common beekeeping practices, such as supplementing bees diet with high-fructose corn syrup, said David Epstein, a senior entomologist with the USDA. He noted that the quality of bees food is as important as the quantity."You can think of it in terms of yourself," Epstein said. "If you are studying for exams in college, and youre not eating properly and youre existing on coffee, then you make yourself more susceptible to disease and you get sick."Tim Tucker, who has between 400 and 500 hives at sites in Kansas and Texas, said he may take some of his bees to South Dakota this year because the fields around his farm near Niotaze, Kan., no longer provide much food for them."There used to be a lot of small farms in our area that had clover and a variety of crops, whereas in the last 20 years its really been corn, soybean and cotton and a little bit of canola," Tucker said. "But those crops dont provide a lot of good nectar and pollen for bees."Tucker, who is president of the American Beekeeping Federation, said the last "really good" year he had was 1999, when he got more than 100 pounds of honey per hive. Last year, he averaged about 42 pounds per hive.He hopes dairy farmers, beef cattle ranchers and others will sign up for the new USDA program by the March 21 deadline.Its not a "cure all," Tucker said, but "anything we do to help provide habitat for honeybees and for native bees and pollinators is a step."	2014-02-25

U.S. employers added just 88,000 jobs in March, the fewest in nine months and a sharp retreat after a period of strong hiring. Many discouraged Americans are giving up the job hunt for school, retirement and disability. (AP Photo/Steve Helber, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  After a full year of fruitless job hunting, Natasha Baebler just gave up.Shed already abandoned hope of getting work in her field, counseling the disabled. But she couldnt land anything else, either — not even a job interview at a telephone call center.ADVERTISEMENTUntil she feels confident enough to send out resumes again, shell get by on food stamps and disability checks from Social Security and live with her parents in St. Louis."Im not proud of it," says Baebler, who is in her mid-30s and is blind. "The only way Im able to sustain any semblance of self-preservation is to rely on government programs that I have no desire to be on."Baeblers frustrating experience has become all too common nearly four years after the Great Recession ended: Many Americans are still so discouraged that theyve given up on the job market.Older Americans have retired early. Younger ones have enrolled in school. Others have suspended their job hunt until the employment landscape brightens. Some, like Baebler, are collecting disability checks.It isnt supposed to be this way. After a recession, an improving economy is supposed to bring people back into the job market.Instead, the number of Americans in the labor force — those who have a job or are looking for one — fell by nearly half a million people from February to March, the government said Friday. And the percentage of working-age adults in the labor force — whats called the participation rate — fell to 63.3 percent last month. Its the lowest such figure since May 1979.The falling participation rate tarnished the only apparent good news in the jobs report the Labor Department released Friday: The unemployment rate dropped to a four-year low of 7.6 percent in March from 7.7 in February.People without a job who stop looking for one are no longer counted as unemployed. Thats why the U.S. unemployment rate dropped in March despite weak hiring. If the 496,000 who left the labor force last month had still been looking for jobs, the unemployment rate would have risen to 7.9 percent in March."Unemployment dropped for all the wrong reasons," says Craig Alexander, chief economist with TD Bank Financial Group. "It dropped because more workers stopped looking for jobs. It signaled less confidence and optimism that there are jobs out there."The participation rate peaked at 67.3 percent in 2000, reflecting an influx of women into the work force. Its been falling steadily ever since.Part of the drop reflects the baby boom generations gradual move into retirement. But such demographics arent the whole answer.Even Americans of prime working age — 25 to 54 years old — are dropping out of the workforce. Their participation rate fell to 81.1 percent last month, tied with November for the lowest since December 1984."Its the lack of job opportunities — the lack of demand for workers — that is keeping these workers from working or seeking work," says Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. The Labor Department says there are still more than three unemployed people for every job opening.Cynthia Marriott gave up her job search after an interview in October for a position as a hotel concierge."They never said no," she says. "They just never called me back."Her husband hasnt worked full time since 2006. She cashed out her 401(k) after being laid off from a job at a Los Angeles entertainment publicity firm in 2009. The couple owes thousands in taxes for that withdrawal. They have no health insurance.She got the maximum 99 weeks of unemployment benefits then allowed in California and then moved to Atlanta.Now she is looking to receive federal disability benefits for a lung condition that she said leaves her weak and unable to work a full day. The application is pending a medical review."I feel like I have no choice," says Marriott, 47. "Its just really sad and frightening"During the peak of her job search, Marriott was filling out 10 applications a day. She applied for jobs she felt overqualified for, such as those at Home Depot and Petco but never heard back. Eventually, the disappointment and fatigue got to her."I just wanted a job," she says. "I couldnt really go on anymore looking for a job."Young people are leaving the job market, too. The participation rate for Americans ages 20 to 24 hit a 41-year low 69.6 percent last year before bouncing back a bit. Many young people have enrolled in community colleges and universities. Thats one reason a record 63 percent of adults ages 25 to 29 have spent at least some time in college, according to the Pew Research Center.Older Americans are returning to school, too. Doug Damato, who lives in Asheville, N.C., lost his job as an installer at a utility company in February 2012. He stopped looking for work last fall, when he began taking classes in mechanical engineering at Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College.Next week, Damato, 40, will accept an academic award for earning top grades. But one obstacle has emerged: Under a recent change in state law, his unemployment benefits will now end July 1, six months earlier than he expected.Hes planning to work nights, if possible, to support himself once the benefits run out. Dropping out of school is "out of the question," he said, given the time he has already put into the program."I dont want a handout," he says. "Im trying to better myself."Many older Americans who lost their jobs are finding refuge in Social Securitys disability program. Nearly 8.9 million Americans are receiving disability checks, up 1.3 million from when the recession ended in June 2009.Natasha Baeblers journey out of the labor force and onto the disability rolls began when she lost her job serving disabled students and staff members at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., in February 2012.For six months, she sought jobs in her field, brandishing masters degrees in social education and counseling. No luck.Then she just started looking for anything. Still, she had no takers."I chose to stop and take a step back for a while ... After youve seen that amount of rejection," she says, "you start thinking, Whats going to make this time any different? "___Washington reported from Pittsburgh. AP Business Writers Christopher S.

Malsam nearly went broke in the 1980s when corn was cheap. So now that prices are high and he can finally make a profit, hes not about to apologize for ripping up prairieland to plant corn.APROSCOE, S.D. –  Robert Malsam nearly went broke in the 1980s when corn was cheap. So now that prices are high and he can finally make a profit, hes not about to apologize for ripping up prairieland to plant corn.Across the Dakotas and Nebraska, more than 1 million acres of the Great Plains are giving way to cornfields as farmers transform the wild expanse that once served as the backdrop for American pioneers.ADVERTISEMENTThis expansion of the Corn Belt is fueled in part by Americas green energy policy, which requires oil companies to blend billions of gallons of corn ethanol into their gasoline. In 2010, fuel became the No. 1 use for corn in America, a title it held in 2011 and 2012 and narrowly lost this year. That helps keep prices high."Its not hard to do the math there as to whats profitable to have," Malsam said. "I think an ethanol plant is a farmers friend."What the green-energy program has made profitable, however, is far from green. A policy intended to reduce global warming is encouraging a farming practice that actually could worsen it.Thats because plowing into untouched grassland releases carbon dioxide that has been naturally locked in the soil. It also increases erosion and requires farmers to use fertilizers and other industrial chemicals. In turn, that destroys native plants and wipes out wildlife habitats.It appeared so damaging that scientists warned that Americas corn-for-ethanol policy would fail as an anti-global warming strategy if too many farmers plowed over virgin land.The Obama administration argued that would not happen. But the administration didnt set up a way to monitor whether it actually happened.It did.More than 1.2 million acres of grassland have been lost since the federal government required that gasoline be blended with increasing amounts of ethanol, an Associated Press analysis of satellite data found. Plots that were wild grass or pastureland seven years ago are now corn and soybean fields.Thats in addition to the 5 million acres of farmland that had been aside for conservation — more than Yellowstone, Everglades and Yosemite National Parks combined — that have vanished since Obama took office.In South Dakota, more than 370,000 acres of grassland have been uprooted and farmed from since 2006. In Edmunds County, a rural community about two hours north of the capital, Pierre, at least 42,000 acres of grassland have become cropland — one of the largest turnovers in the region.Malsam runs a 13-square-mile family farm there. He grows corn, soybeans and wheat, then rents out his grassland for grazing. Each year, the family converts another 160 acres from grass to cropland.Chemicals kill the grass. Machines remove the rocks. Then tractors plow it three times to break up the sod and prepare it for planting.Scattered among fields of 7-foot tall corn and thigh-high soybeans, some stretches of grassland still exist. Cattle munch on some grass. And "prairie potholes" — natural ponds ranging from small pools to larger lakes — support a smattering of ducks, geese, pelicans and herons.Yet within a mile of Malsams farm, federal satellite data show, more than 300 acres of grassland have been converted to soybeans and corn since 2006.Nebraska has lost at least 830,000 acres of grassland, a total larger than New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas combined."Its great to see farmers making money. It hasnt always been that way," said Craig Cox of the Environmental Working Group. He advocates for clean energy but opposes the ethanol mandate. "If were going to push the land this hard, we really need to intensify conservation in lockstep with production, and thats just not happening," he said.Jeff Lautt, CEO of Poet, which operates ethanol refineries across the country, including in South Dakota, said its up to farmers how to use their land."The last I checked, it is still an open market. And farmers that own land are free to farm their land to the extent they think they can make money on it or whatever purpose they need," he said.Yet Chris Wright, a professor at South Dakota State University who has studied land conversion, said: "The conversation about land preservation should start now before it becomes a serious problem." Wright reviewed the APs methodology for determining land conversion.The APs analysis used government satellite data to count how much grassland existed in 2006 in each county, then compare each plot of land to corresponding satellite data from 2012.The data from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Department of Agriculture identify corn and soybean fields. That allowed the AP to see which plots of grassland became cropland.To reach its conservative estimate of 1.2 million acres lost, the AP excluded grassland that had been set aside under the governments Conservation Reserve Program, in which old farmland is allowed to return to a near-natural state. The AP used half-acre sections of earth and excluded tiny tracts that became corn, which experts said were most likely outliers.Corn prices more than doubled in the years after Congress passed the ethanol mandate in 2007. Now, Malsam said, farmers can make about $500 an acre planting corn.His farm has just become profitable in the past five years, allowing him and his wife, Theresa, to build a new house on the farmstead.Four miles south, signs at each end of the town of Roscoe announce a population of only 324. But the town, which relies in part on incomes like Malsams, supports a school, a restaurant, a bank, a grocery store and a large farm machinery store.The manager of the equipment dealership, Kaleb Rodgers, said the booming farm economy has helped the town and the dealership prosper. The business with 28 employees last year sold a dozen combines at about $300,000 apiece, plus more than 60 tractors worth between $100,000 and $300,000, he said."If we didnt have any farmers we wouldnt have a community here. We wouldnt have a business. I wouldnt be sitting here. I wouldnt be able to feed my family," Rodgers said. "I think ethanol is a very good thing."Jim Faulstich, president of the South Dakota Grasslands Coalition, said the nations ethanol and crop insurance policies have encouraged the transformation of the land.Faulstich, who farms and ranches in central South Dakota near Highmore, said much of the land being converted is not suited to crop production, and South Dakotas strong winds and rains will erode the topsoil."I guess a good motto would be to farm the best and leave the rest," he said.	2013-11-13

But rebuilding their herds will be neither cheap nor a short-term process, even in the nations top cattle-producing state.Texas lost 15 percent of its cattle -- or about 2 million animals -- between January 2011 and January 2013, as ranchers sold them to out-of-state buyers or sent them to slaughter amid an unrelenting drought. That helped the size of the U.S. herd drop to 89.3 million head, the lowest level since the 1950s.ADVERTISEMENTMany ranchers are now interested in starting to rebuild, eyeing improving beef markets. But theyre relying on several variables, the most important being reliable pastures, said Eldon White, executive vice president of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association."Its going to be a slow, gradual increase as long as we have moisture," added Shawn Fryrear, who manages about 2,500 cattle on 10 ranches in Central Texas. "I feel like everyone is looking at the glass half full."Ranchers also need females -- especially pregnant heifers, which are now going for as much as $2,500 each, compared to $1,500 before the drought. Many ranchers sold more of their heifers, females that havent had their first calf, and mother cows during the drought to save feed costs.David Anderson, an agricultural economist with Texas A&M University, said he expects producers will hold on to more of their heifers but noted that ranchers have tough decisions."Its like a tug of war or a seesaw between a future return, from what that female would produce over her life, versus the price I would get today to sell her," Anderson said.  "I think its still up in the air how many theyre really going to get to keep."Ranchers in the driest areas arent as keen to buy costly replacement heifers despite the economic incentives, including Rob Sandidge, whose herd west of San Antonio is about a quarter of the size it was before the 2011 drought."Those heifers are worth a lot of money, but thats what it takes to rebuild," he said.But his water sources remain dry, so the 64-year-old plans to hold off building up his herd for now."We did grow some grass," he said last month. "We still dont have any (full stock) tanks, none of the creeks are running. Were just kind of holding on right now."With the exception of West Texas, where the chances for rain through February are below normal, forecasters are offering equal chances for above, below or near normal precipitation for the rest of the state.The drought of 2011 was Texas most intense one-year drought on record, and its devastation remains fresh. Agriculture in Texas lost $7.6 billion that year, including $3.2 billion in livestock losses, such as selling off cattle or higher costs for feed. Pastures were left cracked and barren by triple-digit heat, far too little rain and windier than normal conditions.At its worst, 88 percent of the state was in the most severe stage of drought on the U.S. Drought Monitor map.Now, about 44 percent of Texas is amid drought, and far less land is in the worst dryness categories than in previous years, while 28 percent of the state is considered abnormally dry. There is no drought in East Texas and parts of Southeast Texas, where many of the states cattle are produced.Those with decent conditions are eyeing market positives. All fresh beef in the U.S. averaged $4.92 a pound from January through October 2013, an increase of 5.3 percent compared to the same period in 2012, according to reports from the Livestock Marketing Information Center and the U.S. Meat Federation, a trade association.Foreign demand also is growing. Total beef exports for last year through October were up 2 percent and valued at $5.1 billion. By the end of 2013, the total was expected to surpass 2012s record $5.5 billion. Mexico and Japan each bought 40 percent more beef in October than the same month in 2012, and Hong Kongs imports skyrocketed 148 percent.In addition, a good corn crop has prices for the grain down as much as $2.50 a bushel, while hay stocks have increased, said Kevin Good, an analyst at CattleFax, a Colorado-based information group that serves all segments of the cattle business.Good noted that cow slaughter numbers could be down by 200,000 for the year when the U.S. Department of Agriculture releases its January inventory report. The number needs to drop by at least 500,000 in each of the next two years for an expansion of the overall U.S. herd to have a chance, he said."Thats what it takes to go from liquidation to expansion," Good said.Austin-based rancher Dan Dierschke didnt sell any of his animals during the drought -- and hes glad he held onto them."To go out and pay what todays prices are it takes more nerves than I have," the 74-year-old said. "Im glad there are people that want to do it because it supports the markets, the prices for those animals that Im selling."	2014-01-04

Stock and mutual fund portfolios gained nearly $1.7 trillion, or 9 percent, according to a Thursday report by the Federal Reserve.ADVERTISEMENTThe value of Americans homes rose just over $400 billion, a 2 percent gain. And checking account balances, pensions plan assets and retirement savings, such as 401(k)s, also increased.Strong wealth gains tend to trigger more consumer spending, a critical fuel for economic growth. Higher household net worth is one reason economists have forecast that the U.S. economy will accelerate later this year.Household wealth, or net worth, reflects the value of homes, stocks, bank accounts and other assets minus mortgages, credit cards and other debts.Last year, home prices nationwide rose by the most in eight years. And the Standard & Poors 500 index of large stocks jumped 32 percent. So far this year, home-price gains have slowed, and the S&P 500 has risen just 1.4 percent.The Great Recession hammered Americans net worth, cutting their overall wealth to $55.6 trillion in the first quarter of 2009. That was 19 percent below the pre-recession peak of $68.8 trillion.U.S. wealth has since recovered. But households havent benefited equally. Much of the rebound stems from stock market gains. Yet roughly 10 percent of households own about 80 percent of stocks. Most middle-class wealth stems from home ownership, and house prices nationwide remain below the peak reached in the spring of 2006.Still, rising wealth and an improving economy are encouraging more Americans to take on debt, which can be a sign of confidence. Total household debt ticked up 0.4 percent in the quarter, mostly because Americans took out more auto and student loans.___Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber	2014-03-06

Imports edged up 0.4 percent to $232.7 billion, reflecting gains in imports of autos and clothing which offset a drop in crude oil, which fell to the lowest level in more than three years.A higher trade deficit acts as a drag on economic growth because it means U.S. companies are making less overseas than their foreign competitors are earning in U.S. sales.	2014-04-03

Penney swung to a small profit in the fourth quarter from a massive loss a year ago. The improved results come even as the beleaguered retailer had a revenue shortfall.The company also said that it expects that a key revenue measure should increase from 3 percent to 5 percent in the current quarter, which would mark the second straight quarter of gains in more than two years.ADVERTISEMENTInvestors were encouraged by the results, pushing shares up nearly 5 percent, or 29 cents, to $6.25 per share in aftermarket trading when the results were announced. Shares had risen close to 6 percent, or 33 cents per share, to $5.96 during regular trading.The results, which cover the crucial holiday shopping season, show signs that Penney is making strides in recovering from a botched transformation plan by its former CEO, Ron Johnson. Johnson, the mastermind behind Apples retail concept, was ousted last April after 17 months on the job, and the board rehired Mike Ullman who had previously been at the helm for seven years.Ullman is trying to win back shoppers by restoring the sales events and basic merchandise that the company ditched under Johnson in a bid to attract younger, wealthier consumers. Earlier last month, Penney announced thousands of jobs cuts and the closure of 33 stores as it attempts to get back on the path of profitability."J.C. Penney achieved what it set out to do on a number of important fronts in 2013," said Ullman, in a statement. "We stabilized our business, both financially and operationally."But he acknowledged theres more work to do.Shares are down 86 percent from the $43 it reached in early February 2012 when investor enthusiasm was high amid hopes for Johnsons plan. The stock is down 32 percent so far this year.Penney said Wednesday that it earned $35 million, or 11 cents per share, in the three-month period ended Feb. 1. That compares with a massive loss of $552 million, or $2.51 per share, in the year-ago period.Revenue slipped 2.6 percent to $3.78 billion.Excluding a tax benefit and other items, Penney had a loss of $206 million, or 68 cents per share, in the quarter. Analysts had expected a loss of 81 cents on revenue of $3.84 billion.The company said revenue at stores opened at least a year was up 2 percent in the fourth quarter. Thats compared with a 31.7 percent plunge for that measure for the holiday quarter a year ago.In the latest year, Penney recorded a loss of $1.39 billion or $5.57 per share, while revenue dropped 8.7 percent to $11.86 billion as Johnsons legacy continues to cast a shadow on its results.Penney recorded a nearly $1 billion loss as revenue dropped 25 percent to $12.9 billion for the year that ended Feb. 2, 2013, the companys first year of Johnsons failed transformation plan.Last month, the company said that it ended 2013 with more than $2 billion in total available liquidity.	2014-02-26

The Abound Solar plant, which got $400 million in federal loan guarantees in 2010, when the Obama administration sought to use stimulus funds to promote green energy, filed for bankruptcy two years later. Now its Longmont, Colo., facility sits unoccupied, its 37,000 square feet littered with hazardous waste, broken glass and contaminated water. The Northern Colorado Business Report estimates it will cost up to $3.7 million to clean and repair the building so it can again be leased.ADVERTISEMENT“As lawyers, regulators, bankruptcy officials and the landlord spar over the case, the building lies in disrepair, too contaminated to lease,” the report stated.- National Legal and Policy Center, a think tankThe owner of the property tried to force a bankruptcy trustee to clean the facility, but the report said it would "place humans at imminent and significant health risk." One of the hazards is the presence of cadmium, a cancer-causing agent that is used to produce the film on the solar panels, the report said.While the loan guarantees exposed taxpayers to hundreds of millions of dollars, the federal government lost a total of $70 million backing the failed company. Unsold inventory which should have been used to offset those losses, including 2,000 solar panels, mysteriously disappeared, according to the National Legal and Policy Center."If a coal, oil or gas company pulled something like that the EPA would send out SWAT teams and the U.S. Marshals to track down the offenders, bankrupt or not," the center said in a report of its own.President Obama touted Abound in a July 3, 2010 announcement of a $2 billion “investment” in green energy projects."The second company is Abound Solar Manufacturing, which will manufacture advanced solar panels at two new plants, creating more than 2,000 construction jobs and 1,500 permanent jobs," Obama said. "A Colorado plant is already underway, and an Indiana plant will be built in what’s now an empty Chrysler factory. When fully operational, these plants will produce millions of state-of-the-art solar panels each year."But less than two years later, the company laid off half of its 400 workers, and then, in the summer of 2012, filed for bankruptcy. It became the third clean-energy company to seek bankruptcy protection after receiving a loan from the Energy Department under the economic stimulus law. California solar panel maker Solyndra and Beacon Power, a Massachusetts energy-storage firm, also declared bankruptcy. Solyndra received a $528 million federal loan, while Beacon Power got a $43 million loan guarantee.While solar energy is touted as clean, The Associated Press reported that many panel makers are grappling with a hazardous waste problem. Fueled partly by billions in government incentives, the industry is creating millions of solar panels each year and, in the process, millions of pounds of toxic sludge and contaminated water.To dispose of the material, the companies must transport it by truck or rail far from their own plants to waste facilities hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of miles away.The fossil fuels used to transport that waste, experts say, is not typically considered in calculating solars carbon footprint, giving scientists and consumers who use the measurement to gauge a products impact on global warming the impression that solar is cleaner than it is.After installing a solar panel, "it would take one to three months of generating electricity to pay off the energy invested in driving those hazardous waste emissions out of state," said Dustin Mulvaney, a San Jose State University environmental studies professor who conducts carbon footprint analyses of solar, biofuel and natural gas production.The waste from manufacturing has raised concerns within the industry, which fears that the problem, if left unchecked, could undermine solars green image at a time when companies are facing stiff competition from each other and from low-cost panel manufacturers from China and elsewhere.The Associated Press contributed to this report 	2013-10-31

NEW YORK –  Januarys global sell-off in stocks has left many small investors more puzzled than panicked — and unsure how to act.Theyre holding on for now as prices continue to tumble, but their anxiety is mounting. The number of small investors who say they feel "bearish" soared this past week, according to a U.S. survey. Some stock funds have been hit with their biggest withdrawals since 2012.ADVERTISEMENTIf more people start selling, it would reverse a new and surprising trend in some of the worlds biggest economies: individuals moving back into stocks after years of shunning them."I dont know what to do," says Ken Duska, a retiree in Mingo Junction, Ohio, who is sticking with his investment plan for the moment, though hes not sure thats wise. "After (the) upswing last year, it probably isnt going to continue."Small investors around the world were on edge even before growing signs of a slowdown in China and plunging emerging-market currencies sent stocks sharply lower this week. They were fearful stocks had climbed too fast, and were overdue for a drop, after soaring by double-digit percentages in countries like the U.S., Japan and France in 2013. In the U.S., some stock bulls had been bracing for a drop of 10 percent or more, known on Wall Street as a correction. That hasnt happened in more than two years.Now, they have more cause to believe one may be at hand.The Dow Jones industrial average has swooned 5 percent from a recent peak after investors became unnerved by reports of a manufacturing drop in China and economic mismanagement in countries like Argentina that sent the nations currency plunging."The question is, Is this all of it, or is there significantly more to come?" says Greg Sarian, a managing director at the Sarian Group at HighTower, a wealth advisory firm in Pennsylvania.Anxiety has ramped up in Asia, too."Clients were very worried as they havent seen such market jitters in a while," says Lee Young-hwan, a private banking consultant at Daishin Securities Co. in Seoul, South Korea. Still, he says that many are more inclined to snap up stocks now at lower prices, than to bail out.That countrys main index, the Kospi, is down 3 percent since the start of year. In Japan, the Nikkei is off 8.5 percent, after soaring 58 percent last year. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong has fallen nearly 6 percent, after a 3 percent gain.In Moscow, where the main stock index has been dropping for a year, Marina Pliskina, an English teacher, decided shed finally had enough. She recently sold all of her stocks. "You want your money to last, but then it goes down and down," she says.Since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, small investors have mostly dumped stocks. But recently, buoyed by strengthening economies in the developed world, they have crept back into the market in some countries.In the final four months of last year, nearly $100 billion flowed into stock mutual funds in seven big economies tracked by Lipper Inc., a fund data provider. The countries are the U.S., which accounted for much of the buying, as well as Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Canada and South Korea.Now, that flood of money might reverse as investors grow more worried.At the start of the year, more than twice as many U.S. investors said they were bullish on stocks than said they were bearish, according to a survey by the American Association of Individual Investors. Now, the bears and bulls are neck and neck, with sentiments yo-yoing along with the indexes."Ive lost ... maybe $50,000 in the past week, and Im not happy about it," says Scott Woodall, 44, of Acworth, Ga. "I hate the stock market."A sign of the times: The price of gold, considered the ultimate "safe" asset by fearful investors, is up 3.3 percent this year after plunging 28 percent in 2013. Investors are also buying U.S Treasury bonds despite Federal Reserve moves to scale back its purchases of them. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note, which falls when prices rise, has dropped from 3 percent at the start of the year to 2.7 percent, a big move.There were other signs Friday that fear might be spreading.In the U.S., the Standard and Poors 500 index, a broader measure than the Dow, was down 0.5 percent in early trading, on track for a fifth loss in seven trading sessions. That said, the index is well shy of a correction. It is down 3.4 percent from its record close on Jan. 15,Stocks in Germany were also falling on Friday, with the countrys DAX index down 0.5 percent, despite a strong economy and a low unemployment rate.So far, some small investors seem willing to ride out the storm, though they dont sound too happy.Leighanne Franklin, a mental health therapist in Greenwood, N.Y., wonders whether U.S. stocks are "just another bubble." But she is adding to her retirement account anyway, partly because she doesnt want to miss out on matching funds from her employer.

All are working in some capacity to fix the citys finances or on the bankruptcy case filed July 18.ADVERTISEMENTRising fees drew notice from the presiding judge recently when a lawyer for retirees in the bankruptcy case described the hiring of a $175,000-a-month consultant as typical for a corporate bankruptcy."Im sure that is so, but were talking about public money," said U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes, who on Monday approved a contract for the city to pay the investment bank, Lazard Ltd., to advise a committee representing the citys 23,500 retired workers on financial and restructuring issues. A Lazard managing director said the fee is appropriate given the firms expertise in restructuring work.Detroits restructuring bills since its July bankruptcy filing already exceed post-filing fees paid by Alabamas Jefferson County, which has spent $25.7 million in the two years since filing for bankruptcy, according to local officials. That one of the poorest big cities in the U.S. is becoming lucrative business for some professionals is rubbing some Detroiters the wrong way."Surely part of that money could have been spent better on trying to save the pensions of people in need," said Syri Harris, 41 years old, whose husband died on duty in 2008 after 17 years as a city firefighter.Harris, a mother of six, said she is worried about potential pension cuts for her but is even more concerned on behalf of older retirees on fixed incomes. With its bankruptcy filing, Detroit stopped paying some other debt, including payments to its pension funds, freeing up cash to pay its lawyers and consultants. The city had a cash balance of $128.5 million for the quarter that ended Sept. 30.City officials contend the charges arent out of line. "The fees are reasonable compared with the magnitude of what we have to do and the level of opposition that were getting at every turn," said Kevyn Orr, Detroits emergency manager, in a recent interview. Several consultants, he said, have cut their fees by as much as 25 percent.Click for more from WSJ.com	2013-12-18

The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official wasnt authorized to speak publicly about the probe.ADVERTISEMENTNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating a 1986 deal in which the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey sold the naming rights to one of its outgoing executives for use by a nonprofit organization called The World Trade Centers Association. The Port Authority owns the World Trade Center site but is among hundreds of entities worldwide that pay to use the "World Trade Center" name."The attorney general is looking to find out how the WTCA got such a sweetheart deal on the naming rights, how much revenue the WTCA makes selling the name and how that price is set," the official said.The Record newspaper reported in September that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey sold the naming rights to Guy Tozzoli in his role as head of the nonprofit WTCA. Tozzoli died in February.The letter obtained by the AP sets an Oct. 25 deadline for responses to the World Trade Centers in cities including Houston, New Orleans, Detroit and Sacramento.The letters seek the date in which each entity entered into an agreement with the World Trade Centers Association, the end date of any agreement, and the amount paid to the association, and names of principals involved and the license agreements.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo referred the case to Schneiderman on Sept. 17."Using the millions of dollars in annual revenue from licensing fees paid by companies around the globe for the use of the World Trade Center brand, Mr. Tozzoli received exorbitant annual compensation," Cuomo said.___Dave Porter reported from Newark, N.J.	2013-10-07

Value is purchased through an exchange website with a mainstream paper currency, such as dollars or euros, though trading isnt government-regulated.Using the currency can streamline international business deals, said Julian Tosh, a consultant and owner of the marketplace website bitcoinsinvegas.com."There are a bunch of people who have bitcoins, and theyre dying for a place to spend it," Tosh told the Las Vegas Review-Journal (http://bit.ly/1b2VrHk ).He said Sommers willingness to accept bitcoin could open the home to a global audience."If you increase awareness of potential buyers, you could tap into new markets," Tosh said.Sommer has put a lot of work into the home in the posh Spanish Trail Country Club. It features marble from China, Iceland and Brazil, a full basement, staff quarters with Jacuzzis, and a secret garden. It also has 39 air-conditioning zones fed from a 120-ton cooling tower.Library shelves are stainless steel clad in American cherry wood, and the view from the owners suite is of golf course fairways.Sommer once owned the Aladdin resort, which is now the Planet Hollywood Resort on the Las Vegas Strip.He said he and his wife, Laura, considered the additions theyve made to the home "an exercise in how many cool details we could put in." He said they were downsizing now that their seven children have grown and moved out.Sommers sales agent, Craig Tann, of Prudential American Groups Estates of Las Vegas team, said the home may be the first in southern Nevada to be marketed formally around bitcoin.A range of businesses accept the currency. A California Lamborghini dealership sold a $103,000 Tesla to a Florida man for 91.4 bitcoin, the Review-Journal reported, and a Canadian man listed his Alberta home for the bitcoin equivalent of $405,000.The currency hit a watermark when Bank of America Merrill Lynch said this month that one bitcoin could have a maximum value of $1,300, or more than the price of an ounce of gold.A bitcoin on Friday was valued at about $870, up from $10 in January.Tosh acknowledged the volatility in value could make a $7.85 million bitcoin trade risky."Locking in a price for such a large transaction is going to be kind of difficult," he said. "If the value is changing 30 percent a day, how do you quantify that in a contract and expect each side to hold on for 30 to 90 days while escrow clears?"	2013-12-14

SACRAMENTO, Calif. –  A second health insurer notified state regulators Tuesday that it will stop selling individual policies in California.UnitedHealthcare announced it will no longer offer individual insurance plans after the end of the year. It will focus instead on its core business of group plans for large and small employers.ADVERTISEMENT"Our individual business in California has always been relatively small and we currently serve less than 8,000 individual customers across the state," the company said in a statement. "Over the years, it has become more difficult to administer these plans in a cost-effective way for our members in California."The announcement comes two weeks after Aetna Inc. said it also plans to exit Californias individual insurance market. Both insurers avoided participating in the state exchange that is being established as part of the Affordable Care Act.State Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones says the departure of UnitedHealthcare and Aetna is bad news for consumers."While both UnitedHealthcare and Aetna have a very small share of Californias individual health insurance market, their departure means less choice, less competition, and more market consolidation by the remaining big three health insurers -- Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California, and Kaiser -- which means an increased likelihood of even higher prices from those health insurers downstream," Jones, a Democrat, said in a statement.According to 2011 figures compiled by the California HealthCare Foundation, Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield and Kaiser have 87 percent of the individual market.Starting Oct. 1, those seeking to buy their own health insurance will be directed to Covered California, the states new exchange, where 13 insurance carriers will sell individual policies.Aetna and UnitedHealthcare chose not to participate in the exchange.	2013-07-02

Advances in technology such as fracking, horizontal drilling and other improvements, which have increased natural gas production by 27 percent in just four years, have made the U.S. number one in gas -- with oil on its way.ADVERTISEMENT"We could make OPEC ‘NOPEC’ if we really put our minds to it," says Charles Drevna of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. "Were talking decades, if not into the 100s of years, of supply in North America."Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., of the House Natural Resources Committee says, "Its amazing the amount of energy in North America. When you include our Canadian and Mexican neighbors, we have so many resources that its mind boggling."And Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., of House Energy and Commerce Committee adds, "We have the unique opportunity at this particular time in our nations history to really be energy independent."Jack Gerard, president of oil industrys American Petroleum Institute says, "Its very realistic that we could be energy secure as a nation. ... Its been estimated by the Energy Information Agency that we could be the No. 1 oil producer in the world by 2020, surpassing Saudi Arabia. So this is a big deal. Its a game-changing opportunity, and its of historic proportions."Even those who share the administrations desire to reduce the reliance on petrochemicals acknowledge government projections that the U.S. will produce one third more of its own oil by 2020.One analyst, however, says self reliance must include alternatives, such as wind, solar and more."We can reduce our dependence on foreign oil by shifting to electric vehicles and investing in public transportation, as well as having much more efficient cars, which are already under way," Daniel Weiss of the Center for American Progress said.Either way, analysts say, being more energy sufficient could bring manufacturers back to the U.S., because theyd have a cheap and reliable source of energy."The primary driver right now the manufacturing industry is energy costs," Gerard said. "When you look at those potential opportunities to build new chemical plants, to expand steel capacity, bring home a lot of those jobs that left over the past decade, the primary driver is the cost of energy."The price of natural gas has dropped from $13 to $3, giving the U.S. a huge competitive advantage.In fact, the U.S. is producing so much natural gas, theres talk of actually exporting it, meaning hundreds of billions usually sent overseas to buy energy would instead stay here at home to create jobs and boost the American economy.Jim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).

And businesses stepped up spending on machinery, computers and other long-lasting goods, a sign of investment that could fuel economic growth.Factory orders rose 1.8 percent in November, the Commerce Department said Monday. That follows a 0.5 percent decrease in October.ADVERTISEMENTOrders received by manufacturers totaled a seasonally adjusted $497.8 billion in November, the highest level on records dating to 1992. Orders have increased 2.5 percent over the past 12 months.The improvements could signal accelerating growth in 2014. Americans are buying more cars and homes, increasing demand for steel, furniture and other goods. That has led factories to hire more workers, generating additional economic momentum.Still, overall economic growth remains modest by historical standards. And though factory orders have strengthened in recent months, their growth rate has slowed during the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.A 21.8 percent jump in volatile aircraft orders drove the November gains. But orders rose in many other categories, a sign of strength at factories and confidence among companies.Core capital goods, a proxy for business investment, rose 1 percent. Economists watch this category because it excludes volatile orders for aircraft and defense equipment.Demand also rose for construction machinery, computers, communications equipment, furniture and motor vehicle parts.Most of the gains occurred in long-lasting goods, which increased 3.4 percent in November. Orders for nondurable goods such as food products, clothing and paper rose a modest 0.3 percent.Separate economic reports indicate that manufacturing has remained strong and could drive further growth.Factory activity in December remained near a 2½-year high, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The trade group said last week that its index of manufacturing activity slipped to 57 in from 57.3 in November. Thats still the second-highest reading since April 2011.

The unemployment rate is currently 7.9 percent.ADVERTISEMENTIn a speech Monday to the AFL-CIO, Yellen said those are "thresholds for possible action, not triggers that will necessarily prompt an immediate increase."Her comments echoed remarks Chairman Ben Bernanke made in December after the Fed announced it would change its forward guidance for short-term rate increases. At a news conference after the Feds December meeting, Bernanke said the Fed might decide to keep stimulating the economy even after unemployment falls below 6.5 percent.Yellen has been a close Bernanke ally. She has consistently voted to support his initiatives to boost the economy. Those include the latest change in guidance for short-term rates, as well as bond purchases that have helped push long-term rates lower. Both are designed to encourage more borrowing and spending, which boosts economic growth.Yellen is considered a top prospect to succeed Bernanke as chairman, should he leave when his current term ends on Jan. 31, 2014.Analysts said Yellens comments are a signal that Fed remains committed to aggressive stimulus measures to boost growth and lower unemployment."Yellen does not sound ready to slow asset purchases, far less contemplate tightening policy, any time soon," Dana Saporta, director of U.S. economics at Credit Suisse, said in a research note.	2013-02-11

WASHINGTON –  Average U.S. rates for fixed mortgages declined this week but stayed close to their highest levels in two years.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on the 30-year loan fell to 4.51 percent. Thats down from 4.58 percent last week, the highest since July 2011.ADVERTISEMENTThe average on the 15-year fixed mortgage dipped to 3.54 percent from 3.60 percent, also the highest since July 2011.Rates have risen more than a full percentage point since May when Chairman Ben Bernanke first signaled that the Federal Reserve might reduce its bond purchases later this year. The purchases have helped keep long-term interest rates low.Mortgage rates remain low by historical standards. But the sudden spike in rates could slow the housing recoverys momentum.U.S. sales of newly built homes dropped 13.4 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 394,000, the government said last week. Thats the lowest level in nine months.Also in July, fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes for the second straight month, according to the National Association of Realtors. Still, the decline has been modest and the level of pending homes sales remains close to a 6 ½ -year high reached in May.Mortgage rates have been rising because they tend to follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The yield also has surged on speculation that the Feds stimulus will slow. But the rate on the 10-year note declined this week to 2.78 percent from 2.90 percent last week.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country on Monday through Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for a 30-year mortgage declined to 0.7 point from 0.8 point. The fee for a 15-year loan was unchanged at 0.7 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage fell to 2.64 percent from 2.67 percent. The fee slipped to 0.4 point from 0.5 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage rose to 3.24 percent from 3.21 percent. The fee held at 0.5 point.	2013-08-29

Thats far below the estimate in a Federal Reserve report in March that calculated that Americans as a whole had regained 91 percent of their losses.ADVERTISEMENTHousehold wealth plunged $16 trillion from the third quarter of 2007 through the first quarter of 2009.

The Labor Department reports on the number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits in the last week on Thursday, April 18, 2013. (AP Photo/Toby Talbot)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits increased just 4,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 352,000. The slight gain kept applications at a level consistent with solid hiring and suggests Marchs sluggish hiring may be temporary.The Labor Department report released Thursday also noted that the four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose to 361,250.ADVERTISEMENTApplications are a proxy for layoffs. They jumped three weeks ago to a four-month high, but then plummeted the following week. The sharp fluctuations reflected volatility around the Easter holiday, department officials said. Overall, applications have declined slightly since January.Job growth slowed sharply in March. Employers added only 88,000 jobs last month, much lower than the average monthly gain of 220,000 from November through February.The drop in applications is among the reasons many economists predict job growth rebounded this month, to around 150,000 net jobs.Declines in applications signal that companies are laying off fewer workers. But layoffs are only half of the equation. Businesses also need to be confident enough in the economic outlook to add more jobs.The unemployment rate fell to 7.6 percent in March, down from 7.7 percent in February. Still, the drop occurred because more people out of work stopped looking for jobs. The government doesnt count people as unemployed unless they are actively looking for work.The economy is expected to grow at a much quicker pace in the January-March quarter than in the final three months of last year. Most economists forecast growth could top an annual rate of 3 percent in the first quarter, up from just 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter.But many analysts now expect growth will slow in the April-June quarter, mostly because across-the-board government spending cuts kicked in March 1. That may have made some businesses nervous about hiring last month	2013-04-18

Other pre-teens, from Macaulay Culkin to Miley Cyrus, have been as famous in their time. But none of them helped shape their time the way she did.ADVERTISEMENTDimpled, precocious and oh-so-adorable, she was Americas top box office draw during Hollywoods golden age, and her image was free of the scandals that have plagued Cyrus, Lindsay Lohan and so many other child stars — parental feuds, drugs, alcohol.Temple remains such a symbol of innocence that kids still know the drink named for her: a sweet, nonalcoholic cocktail of ginger ale and grenadine, topped with a maraschino cherry.Her hit movies — which included "Bright Eyes" (1934), "Curly Top" (1935), "Dimples" (1936), "Poor Little Rich Girl" (1936) and "Heidi" (1937) — featured sentimental themes and musical subplots, with stories of resilience and optimism that a struggling American public found appealing. She kept children singing "On the Good Ship Lollipop" for generations.She was also a tribute to the economic and inspirational power of movies, credited with helping to save 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy and praised by President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself for lifting Americas spirits during a gloomy time.She was "just absolutely marvelous, greatest in the world," director Allan Dwan told filmmaker-author Peter Bogdanovich in his book "Who the Devil Made It: Conversations With Legendary Film Directors.""With Shirley, youd just tell her once and shed remember the rest of her life," said Dwan, who directed her in "Heidi" and "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm." Whatever it was she was supposed to do — shed do it. ... And if one of the actors got stuck, shed tell him what his line was — she knew it better than he did."Her achievements did not end with movies. Retired from acting at 21, she went on to hold several diplomatic posts in Republican administrations, including ambassador to Czechoslovakia during the sudden collapse of communism in 1989.Former President George H.W. Bush, who appointed Black to the post in Prague, saluted her Tuesday for "her selfless service to our country" and her film career."In both roles, she truly lifted people up and earned not only a place in our hearts, but also our enduring respect," Bush said in a statement.Temple, known in private life as Shirley Temple Black, died at her home near San Francisco. The cause of death was not disclosed.From 1935 to 1938, she was the most popular screen actress in the country and a bigger draw than Clark Gable, Joan Crawford or Gary Cooper. In 1999, the American Film Institutes ranking of the greatest screen legends put Temple at No. 18 among the 25 actresses."I have one piece of advice for those of you who want to receive the lifetime achievement award: Start early," she quipped in 2006 as she was honored by the Screen Actors Guild.But she also said that evening that her greatest roles were as wife, mother and grandmother: "Theres nothing like real love. Nothing." Her husband of more than 50 years, Charles Black, had died a few months earlier.In "Bright Eyes," Temple introduced the song "On the Good Ship Lollipop" and did battle with a charmingly bratty Jane Withers, launching Withers as another major child star. As a bright-eyed orphan in "Curly Top," she sang "Animal Crackers in My Soup."She was teamed with the legendary dancer Bill "Bojangles" Robinson in two 1935 films with Civil War themes, "The Little Colonel" and "The Littlest Rebel." Their tap dance up the steps in "The Little Colonel" (at a time when interracial teamings were rare in Hollywood) became a landmark in the history of dance on film.Known for a remarkable ability to cry on cue, she won a special Academy Award at age 6 — and was presented with a miniature Oscar statuette — for her "outstanding contribution to screen entertainment."Temple and her movies were an escapist delight and a popular sensation. Mothers dressed their little girls like her, and a line of dolls that are now highly sought-after collectibles was launched.Her fans seemed interested in every last golden curl on her head. Her mother, Gertrude, was said to have done her hair for each movie, with every hairstyle having exactly 56 curls.Roosevelt once said: "As long as our country has Shirley Temple, we will be all right. When the spirit of the people is lower than at any other time during this Depression, it is a splendid thing that for just 15 cents, an American can go to a movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles."Temples mother worked to keep her daughter from being spoiled by fame and was a constant presence during filming. Temple said years later that her mother had been furious when a director once sent the mother off on an errand and then got the child to cry for a scene by frightening her. "She never again left me alone on a set," Temple said.But Temple also suggested that in some ways, she grew up too soon. She stopped believing in Santa Claus at age 6, she once said, when "Mother took me to see him in a department store and he asked for my autograph."Decades later, her interest in politics brought her back into the spotlight.She made an unsuccessful bid for Congress as a Republican in 1967. After Richard Nixon became president in 1969, he appointed her a member of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. General Assembly. In the 1970s, she was U.S. ambassador to Ghana and later U.S. chief of protocol.A few months after she arrived in Prague in 1989, communist rule was overthrown in Czechoslovakia as the Iron Curtain collapsed across Eastern Europe."My main job (initially) was human rights, trying to keep people like future President Vaclav Havel out of jail," she said in a 1999 Associated Press interview. Within months, she was accompanying Havel, the former dissident playwright, when he came to Washington as his countrys new president.She considered her background in entertainment an asset to her political career."Politicians are actors too, dont you think?" she once said. "Usually if you like people and youre outgoing, not a shy little thing, you can do pretty well in politics."Born in Santa Monica, Calif., to an accountant and his wife, Temple had just turned 3 when she made her film debut in 1932 in the Baby Burlesks, a series of short films in which tiny performers parodied grown-up movies, sometimes with risque results.Temples expert singing and tap-dancing in the 1934 movie "Stand Up and Cheer!" first gained her wide notice.Her appeal faded as quickly as it had emerged. She missed a shot at playing Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz" when 20th Century Fox chief Darryl Zanuck refused to lend out his greatest asset; the part went to Judy Garland. And "The Little Princess" in 1939 and "The Blue Bird" in 1940 didnt draw big crowds, prompting Fox to let Temple go.Among her later films were "The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer," as a teen with a crush on Cary Grant, and "Miss Annie Rooney" which included her first on-screen kiss, bestowed by another maturing child star, Dickie Moore.After her film career ended, she concentrated on raising her family and turned to television to host and act in 16 specials called "Shirley Temples Storybook" on ABC. In 1960, she joined NBC and aired "The Shirley Temple Show."In her 1988 autobiography, "Child Star," she revealed some dark moments during an otherwise happy life and career: An MGM producer exposed himself to her when she was 12, and her first marriage, to actor John Agar, was ruined by his drinking and verbal abuse and ended in divorce in 1949. Meanwhile, her father squandered millions of dollars she earned from the movies.She married Black in 1950, and had two children, Lori and Charles. She also had a daughter, Susan, with her first husband.In 1972, she underwent surgery for breast cancer and was credited with opening up public discussion about the disease. She urged women to get checked by their doctors and vowed: "I have much more to accomplish before I am through."___Associated Press writers Martha Mendoza and Matt Reed contributed to this report.	2014-02-11

At Louisiana stores in Springhill and Mansfield, cards registered no spending limits, prompting recipients to go on buying binges.ADVERTISEMENT"It was worse than any Black Friday,” Springhill Police Chief Will Lynd told local station KSLA-TV.- Wll Lynd, Springhill, La., police chiefCustomers said shelves were picked clean in a mob scene that left employees rattled. Walmart spokeswoman Kayla Whaling told the station the company made a conscious decision to keep ringing up goods rather than to cut people off."We did make the decision to continue to accept EBT cards (and purchases on WIC and SNAP) during the outage so that they could get food for their families," she said.But when order was restored and the cards began reading properly, it became clear that some customers were out to take advantage of the taxpayer-funded program. One woman had $700 worth of merchandise in her cart and an EBT card with a balance of just 49 cents.The glitches, which were apparently triggered by a a system failure at Xerox, which handles processing for many states, left other users unable to buy anything. At a Mississippi Walmart, customers rioted and even left the store with groceries without paying after they were unable to use their food stamp cards on Saturday, according to the Clarion-Ledger.The mini riot happened at the Walmart in Philadelphia, Miss. Shortly thereafter, managers decided to temporarily close the store.“For the safety of our customers we did make a management decision to close the store," Whaling said of the Mississippi incident. "We’re looking into everything; looking at surveillance video and working with the local police.”While Walmart, as the nations biggest retailer and grocer, was affected most, the glitch hampered customers at other stores, as well. In Massachusetts, nearly 1 million EBT card users were unable to access the SNAP food program or withdraw cash, said Matthew Kitsos, spokesman with the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance.“We didn’t have answers for them, except for that there were problems in the state,” the manager of a Market Basket in Somerville, who asked that his name not be used, told the Boston Herald. “A lot of people are depending on them. They have kids; they depend on that money.”Xerox spokeswoman Karen Arena told USA Today that some Electronic Benefits Transfer systems were experiencing connectivity issues after a routine test of a backup system at a location in the Midwest caused an outage. U.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Courtney Rowe underscored that the outage was not related to the federal government shutdown. Xerox runs EBT card systems for 17 states. All were affected by the outage.Reports surfaced around 9 a.m. Saturday that customers EBT cards were not working in stores. Other affected states included Alabama, California, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. 	2013-10-14

But those officials appeared at odds over what evidence would demonstrate such gains.Minutes of the Feds April 30-May 1 meeting released Wednesday show "a number" of members expressed a willingness to scale back the $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bonds the Fed has been purchasing, perhaps as soon as next month, if the economy accelerates. The Fed next meets on June 18-19.ADVERTISEMENTStill, Chairman Ben Bernanke, the Feds most important voice, signaled Wednesday in testimony to Congress that it is too soon for the Federal Reserve to slow its extraordinary stimulus programs.Reducing the Feds efforts to keep borrowing rates low would "carry a substantial risk of slowing or ending the economic recovery," Bernanke said in testimony to the Joint Economic Committee, a panel that includes members of the House and Senate.The Fed has been buying $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bonds since September. That has helped lower long-term interest rates and encouraged more borrowing and spending.After the April 30-May 1 meeting, the Fed said it could increase or decrease the pace depending on how the job market and inflation fare.In recent months, the job market and the broader economy have shown renewed vigor. The economy has added an average of 208,000 jobs a month since November. Thats up from only 138,000 a month in the previous six months.At Wednesdays hearing, Bernanke noted that the economy is growing moderately this year and unemployment has fallen to a four-year low of 7.5 percent. Still, unemployment remains well above levels consistent with healthy economies. And Bernanke said higher taxes and deep federal spending cuts are expected to slow economic growth this year.When pressed by lawmakers, Bernanke said the pace could be reduced over the next few meetings, if the job market shows "real and sustainable progress." And he wouldnt rule out curtailing the purchases by Labor Day.But Bernanke said that the Fed could just as quickly reverse course and pick up the pace if the economy falters.	2013-05-22

(AP Photo/The News & Advance, Sam OKeefe, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Consumers boosted their borrowing in December by the largest amount in 10 months as demand for auto, student and credit card loans showed big gains.Consumer borrowing rose $18.8 billion in December, the biggest increase since February, the Federal Reserve reported Friday. The category that includes auto and student loans increased the most, rising $13.8 billion. Credit card debt, which has been lagging, rose by $5 billion. That was the largest jump since May.ADVERTISEMENTThe big increase pushed total borrowing to a fresh record of $3.1 trillion. Gains in borrowing are viewed as an encouraging sign that consumers are more confident and willing to take on more debt to finance consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.Consumers had increased borrowing by $12.4 billion in November.Over the past year, consumers have become more confident and have been willing to take on debt. Most of those gains have come in the category that covers auto and student loans. Credit card borrowing has been rising more slowly.Borrowing on credit cards plunged after the Great Recession as financial institutions tightened lending standards and households became more cautious about taking on high-interest debt at a time when millions of people were losing their jobs.Even with recent gains, credit card debt is still 15.7 percent below its peak above $1 trillion reached in July 2008. Credit card debt in December stood at $861.9 billion, up just 1.9 percent from a year ago.The measure of auto loans and student loans in December stood at $2.24 trillion, up 8 percent from a year ago. It has been up every month but one since May 2010.A separate quarterly report on consumer credit done by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that student loan debt has been the biggest driver of borrowing since the recession officially ended in June 2009.The Feds borrowing report tracks credit card debt, auto loans and student loans but not mortgages or home equity loans.	2014-02-07

But the outdoor theater in this small Georgia town faces a financial hurdle: it must upgrade to a digital projector before the major movie studios phase out 35-millimeter film."It doesnt make a lot of sense to spend $80,000 on a business this size," said owner Tom Major. "But one way or another, Ive got to figure it out."ADVERTISEMENTMajor said he owes it to his customers to stay in business.- Tom Major, owner of Tiger Drive-In"The kids enjoy getting to run around, sit and watch a movie," said Michelle Roberts, whose family made the 40-minute drive from Eastanollee, Ga., to see the animated Thanksgiving comedy "Free Birds." "It gives them something that we used to do when we were kids."Nostalgia is a driving force for customers and owners alike.Majors father in-law opened the Tiger in the 1950s, a decade that saw the number of drive-ins peak at more than 4,000 nationwide. Today, there are fewer than 360, according to the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association (UDITOA).UDITOA President John Vincent estimates that half of Americas drive-ins have already converted to digital projectors, but concedes the upgrade will be difficult for others."There will be, no doubt, some closures," Vincent said. "We do hope that any closures are temporary."Although Dec. 31 is the commonly rumored deadline, Vincent said he wouldnt be surprised if Hollywood continues releasing movies on film through next summer to give theaters more time to make the digital transition."With our studio partners, weve been asking them, When is it gonna happen? When is it gonna happen? Nobody has a date yet," Vincent said. "I wish they were more forthcoming."This year, Honda donated digital projectors to nine outdoor theaters through a campaign called "Project Drive-In." But short of winning a contest, other theaters are trying to reduce costs by leasing projectors or waiting for a used market to develop.When Major reopened his father-in-laws theater in 2004, he couldnt afford the $65,000 price of a new screen, so he built his own from scratch at a fraction of the cost. He said hes optimistic hell come up with another solution to bring the Tiger across the digital divide and preserve a piece of American pop culture for future generations."It brings you back, just like when you see a 1957 Chevy go by," Major said.

WASHINGTON –  Average rates on U.S. long-term fixed mortgages remained steady for a second straight week, giving prospective home buyers more time to lock in historically low levels.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on the 30-year loan remained unchanged at 4.4 percent this week. That is a full percentage point higher than in early May, when rates neared record lows. Still, rates remain low by historical standards.ADVERTISEMENTThe average on the 15-year fixed loan edged up to 3.44 percent from 3.43 percent.Mortgage rates spiked in June after Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated that the Federal Reserve could slow its bond purchases this year. The purchases have helped keep long-term interest rates low, encouraging more home buying. Despite the recent rate increases, mortgages remain a bargain for borrowers who qualify.Low rates have boosted home sales and prices, contributing to a housing recovery that has helped drive economic growth this year.Greater demand, along with a tight supply of homes for sale, has pushed up prices. It also has led to more home construction, which has created jobs.Confidence among U.S. builders is at its highest level in nearly eight years, fueled by optimism that demand for new homes will drive sales growth into next year. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released Thursday reflected the brighter sales outlook.The index jumped to 59 this month from 56 in July. It was the fourth consecutive monthly gain. A reading above 50 indicates more builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor.Mortgage rates tend to follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which has risen on speculation that the Fed could slow its bond-buying stimulus. The rate on the 10-year note rose to 2.79 percent Thursday morning, its highest level since July 2011.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country on Monday through Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged at 0.7 point. The fee for a 15-year loan slipped to 0.6 point from 0.7 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage rose to 2.67 percent from 2.62 percent. The fee edged up to 0.4 point from 0.3 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage increased to 3.23 percent from 3.19 percent. The fee held at 0.5.	2013-08-15

But that may not be enough to ensure the security of the American cotton industry, with China now a major player in the world cotton market.“Most of the cotton now has got to get in the container and go overseas,” South Carolina cotton farmer, Carl Brown Jr. told FoxNews.com.ADVERTISEMENTFor the past three years, China has been turning to the U.S. for millions of bales of cotton. But instead of consuming that cotton and keeping the demand high, the Chinese have been storing it, gradually building its stock up to to more than 60 percent of the worlds inventory.“The fact they are rebuilding their stocks and have almost a years supply of cotton in their warehouse has farmers in this country, merchants and everybody concerned about what’s going to happen to the cotton market,” Brown said.Experts predict that China eventually will have cornered the world cotton market.“They have a lot of control over those stocks, obviously, and that’s having a big impact on our prices,” cotton economist Don Shurley told FoxNews.comChina’s cotton reserves are at a record high 10 million tons, causing U.S. prices per pound to fall from 88 cents in 2012 to 71 cents in 2013. They averaged about $2 a pound in 2010. The U.S. crop also is projected to fall from about 17 million bales in 2012 to 14 million in 2013.“China is the driver,” Brown said.And China eventually could drive the prices down to 50 cents a pound.“If it reaches that, you might as well park your equipment,” Brown said.But that’s partially because U.S. consumption of cotton has dropped dramatically over the years. American cotton consumption is only a third the amount it was in the 90s, as much of the production of clothes has moved overseas.“We don’t have much of a domestic textile industry within the U.S. anymore,” Shurley said.Brown said in the 70s and 80s, 70 out of every 100 bales were used domestically. Now, 80 out of every 100 are being shipped overseas.The decrease in the demand for cotton is being felt nationwide. The National Cotton Council predicts there will be 25 percent less cotton acreage in 2013. But China, the worlds largest producer, largest consumer and largest importer of cotton seems to be the only thing keeping the U.S. cotton market above water.“At some point, they are going to have to quit buying,” Brown said. “When that happens, what’s going to happen?”Mary Quinn OConnor is part of the Junior Reporter program at Fox News.

Total business sales fell 0.3 percent in January after a slight 0.1 percent rise in December.ADVERTISEMENTWeak growth in restocking was a key reason the economy barely grew from October through December. Since then, job growth has accelerated and wages have steadily risen. The combination could lead to greater consumer demand, prompting more business restocking and economic growth.A separate report Wednesday showed that retail sales rose 1.1 percent in February, providing evidence that consumers are being helped by the stronger wage growth.The economy grew only 0.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Still, sharp defense cuts and sluggish restocking, both volatile factors, were the main reason for the weak growth.Economists say faster restocking in the current quarter should help lift growth to around 2 percent in the January-March period.Employers added 236,000 jobs in February. That capped a four-month hiring spree in which the economy averaged 205,000 net jobs per month. And it pushed the unemployment rate to a four-year low of 7.7 percent, down from 7.9 percent in January.Strong auto sales and a steady housing recovery are spurring more hiring, which could trigger more consumer spending and lead to stronger economic growth.

The slowdown in hiring could complicate the Federal Reserves decision later this month on whether to slow its bond purchases.The Labor Department says the unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent, the lowest in nearly five years.

Thats because, unlike many other states, its nearly impossible to buy beef thats been born, raised, slaughtered and processed in Florida -- even though it was the first state to have large-scale cattle ranches.There are nearly 1 million head of calves and cattle in Florida and the industry contributes about $2 billion to the states economy. Seven of the nations 25 largest cattle ranches are in Florida, according to the Florida Beef Council.Most calves are born and raised here, but are finished and processed in states like Texas or Oklahoma, as theres only one large slaughterhouse in Florida at the moment. Despite ranking 10th nationally in the number of cattle, Florida ships the majority of them -- 700,000 feeder calves -- to other states.Cattle ranchers who realize theres a demand for locally grown meat have asked agriculture officials for a designation. But before the likely tag can be applied, the state must first decide what, exactly, Florida beef is. Does the cow have to spend its entire life in Florida?"Adding value to Florida beef through the Fresh From Florida brand is something we are excited about," said state agriculture commissioner Adam Putnam, a fifth-generation Floridian from a cattle-ranching family.The ranchers quest to be included on the "Fresh From Florida" list is a testament to how popular local food has become -- and because ranchers know its more sustainable and cheaper to keep an animal in state. Small farms, farmers markets and specialty food makers have emerged nationwide, and Florida is no different."Its a niche that I believe people will respond to," said Don Quincey, a cattle rancher.During the winter months, its easy to find plenty of local veggies and fruits here. But cattle ranchers say that it will take a little for them while to bring local farm-to-fork beef to the public."Lets face it. If went into the supermarket and you saw `Fresh from Mexico, `Fresh from Arizona and `Fresh from Florida, and youre in Florida, which one would you buy?" said Florida rancher Tom Harper.Over the centuries, cattle have thrived in Florida, freely grazing the swampland and eating wild oranges and scrub brush -- a scenario that would make any locavore drool.North Americas first cattle were brought in 1591 by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon. At one point in the mid-17th century, more than 20,000 head of Spanish cattle were counted in a tax collectors census. These cattle tolerated the heat and were free-ranging; known as "Cracker Cattle," they are leaner than other breeds and also more ornery. But by the 1960s, the number of Cracker Cattle had greatly diminished because of rapid development.Floridas heat and humidity arent conducive for large-scale feedlots of less hardy cattle like those found in Midwestern states like Texas and Oklahoma. And with the rise of corn-finishing cattle on the feedlots, Florida was out of luck -- while theres lots of grass in Florida for weaned calves, the state doesnt grow much corn."We didnt have any options other than to send our cattle west to be fed," said Harper, who owns a purebred Angus breeding operation in north-central Florida, near Gainesville.Quincey said he and a few other Florida ranchers have been able to work around the lack of options by building feedlots and facilities to hold a grain mix for the cattle. He has 1,000 head of cattle he hopes will soon get the "Fresh From Florida" label.Many are born and raised on his Chiefland ranch near Gainesville, then weaned, preconditioned and moved onto a finishing feed operation on the same property."We save a lot of fuel by not having to truck this animal all over the United States," he said, adding he sells some cattle and ships others for finishing out of state.Another hurdle for the states ranchers: Theres only one large slaughterhouse in Florida that can handle 150 head a week, and a handful of smaller ones, like Quinceys.Harper said a second slaughterhouse will open soon near Gainesville, which is the region where many of the states cattle are located. It will process about 300 head of cattle a week.It would be cheaper for farmers if they could breed, raise, finish and slaughter their cows in Florida, he said."Just the cost to send them out west averages about $60-$65 a head," he said. "If we just eliminated extra freight, we would save money. Add that with the fact that people may prefer locally grown beef."	2013-11-02

Despite the decline, manufacturing in the region has grown for five straight months. And measures of hiring and new orders both rose in October, signs that activity should pick up in the coming months."This is a fairly strong result, especially given the turmoil in Washington," said Jim OSullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.The Philadelphia Fed report followed a report Tuesday that factory growth in the New York region declined this month, according to the New York Feds Empire State manufacturing index. The drop in activity in the New York region was also blamed in part on the shutdown.The government reopened on Thursday. Federal workers are reporting back to work now that Congress passed a temporary spending bill and lifted the governments borrowing limit.	2013-10-17

(AP Photo/LM Otero)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  A private survey shows that businesses added jobs at a modest pace in January, a sign that hiring may have rebounded after a disappointing figure in December.Payroll processor ADP says companies added 175,000 jobs last month. Thats down from 227,000 in December, which was revised lower. But it was much better than the governments official figure of just 74,000 new jobs in December.ADVERTISEMENTThe ADP numbers cover only private businesses and often diverge from the governments more comprehensive report. In December its figure came in much higher than the official count.The report comes amid rising fears of a slowdown in the U.S. and global economies. Those fears have caused sharp falls in stock markets worldwide. Turmoil in developing countries and signs of slower growth in the U.S. have also raised uncertainty about the Federal Reserves next steps.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodys Analytics, which compiles ADPs report, said that cold weather "continued to weigh on the job numbers."Many economists said bad weather was partly to blame for the sharp fall-off in December hiring. Job gains had averaged 214,000 a month from August through November, nearly three times Decembers total.Construction added 25,000 jobs in January, the ADP survey found, slightly below Decembers total.

The same cant be said for men, who remain 2.1 million jobs short.The biggest factor is that men dominate construction and manufacturing — industries that have not recovered millions of jobs lost during the downturn.

Among men 76.2 million were employed last month, down from 78.3 million in December 2007.	2013-09-12

But their benefits barely grew.The Labor Department said Tuesday that an index that measures wages and benefits rose 0.3 percent during the first quarter. Thats down from a 0.4 percent gain in the October-December quarter and the smallest gain in a year.ADVERTISEMENTWages and salaries rose 0.5 percent, up from the 0.3 percent gain in the previous quarter. But benefits, which include health insurance and pension contributions, rose just 0.1 percent after a 0.6 percent rise in the fourth quarter.Higher pay has helped consumers shake off an increase in Social Security taxes. Consumer spending rose in the first quarter at the fastest pace in more than two years.But economists said wages must grow even faster to sustain the first-quarter gains in consumer spending.For the 12 months ending in March, wages and salaries are up just 1.6 percent, slightly lower than the 1.7 percent rise in the 12 months ending in December. That means that wages have barely kept up with inflation."We are seeing very weak wage growth," said Gregory Daco, a senior U.S. economist at Global Insight.Wages account for about 70 percent of compensation costs. Benefits account for the other 30 percent.The Labor Department said that it had discovered an error in the benefits data for a private industry sales and office staff covering the current report and the two previous reports. Labor Department analysts said the error should make only a small difference in the overall benefits number.	2013-04-30

However, there is hope that growth accelerated in early 2013 despite higher taxes and cuts in government spending.The Commerce Department says the economy grew at an annual rate of 0.4 percent in the October-December quarter. That was slightly better than the previous estimate of 0.1 percent growth. The revision reflected stronger business investment and export sales.ADVERTISEMENTAnalysts think the economy is growing at a rate of around 2.5 percent in the current January-March quarter, which ends this week.Steady hiring has kept consumers spending this year. And a rebound in company stockpiling, further gains in housing and more business spending also likely drove faster growth in the first quarter.	2013-03-28

The logging industry and its supporters are racing to get it, saying such work would provide jobs in the economically downtrodden region.ADVERTISEMENTSierra Pacific Industries Inc. has started felling trees on about 10,000 acres of its land that got caught up in the inferno. Now, Republican Rep. Tom McClintock, whose district covers the area, has introduced legislation in Congress that would waive environmental regulations so salvage logging can begin quickly on the national forest as well."If any good can come of this tragedy, it would be the timely salvage of fire-killed timber that could provide employment to local mills and desperately needed economic activity to mountain communities," said McClintock, a member of the House Committee on Natural Resources.But Rep. Peter DeFazio, ranking Democrat on the committee, said McClintocks bill—which was heard in a committee hearing Oct. 3—"would be a license to clear-cut the entire burn area."DeFazio said he supports more limited salvage logging, while some environmental groups back almost none at all, saying it hurts forests by removing trees that provide nutrients for soil and habitat for wildlife.The industry has about a two-year window to remove the trees before they succumb to rot and insect damage and become commercially worthless, timber officials say. "The first tragedy to the forest has already happened," said Mike Albrecht, president of Sierra Resource Management Inc., a logging company in Jamestown, Calif., now doing salvage work on private lands. "The second tragedy would be not to salvage it."If approved, the logging would be the biggest salvage-removal job in the Sierra in decades, which the industry says would boost local counties and the states timber industry. Mr. Albrecht said he would likely have to increase his 10-person logging crew to 15, while the total number of salvage loads hauled out of the forest would rise to 250 a day from 160 a day now.Those jobs would go to people like Don Fulton, an 80-year-old who runs a family-owned crew in Tuolumne County. He has had little business in recent years because of environmental rules on logging and other factors, and last year the company worked for just six months, said his daughter, Tammy Power. If salvage logging were approved, "he will go 24-7 until that salvage is out," Power said.For bigger companies like Sierra Pacific, logging healthy trees versus dead ones is more of a wash, said Mark Luster, spokesman for the Anderson, Calif., timber giant. "We are mainly shifting from green [logging] to salvage," Luster said. Another limitation of the economic benefit, other industry officials say, is that there are only enough mills to process about half the available timber, or 500 million board feet of lumber.But officials in the rural counties affected by the fire, which started Aug. 17 from an undetermined cause and was 95% contained as of Friday, said the logging would give them a boost. "We will have to import trucks and labor, so certainly it will help our county," said Karl Rodefer, a supervisor in Tuolumne County, where the Rim Fire was concentrated. He added that removal of the dead trees would also keep them from acting as more fuel in a future fire.Click for more from WSJ.com	2013-10-12

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Average U.S. rates for fixed mortgages fell this week as the latest data continued to indicate a pause in the housing markets recovery.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the average rate for the 30-year loan declined to 4.23 percent from 4.32 percent last week. The average for the 15-year loan dipped to 3.33 percent from 3.40 percent.ADVERTISEMENTMortgage rates have risen about a full percentage point since hitting record lows roughly a year ago. The increase was driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve would reduce its $85 billion a month in bond purchases. Saying the economy was gaining strength, the Fed pushed ahead last week with a plan to reduce the bond purchases, which have kept long-term interest rates low.Data released Tuesday by real estate specialist CoreLogic showed that U.S. home prices slipped from November to December, and the year-over-year increase slowed, likely a result of weaker sales at the end of last year.The December decline was the third straight month-to-month drop. Home prices had risen for eight straight months through September. For all of 2013, prices rose a healthy 11 percent.The Commerce Department reported Monday that U.S. construction spending rose modestly in December, slowing from healthy gains a month earlier.Most economists expect home sales and prices to keep rising this year, but at a slower pace. They forecast that both will likely rise around 5 percent, down from double-digit gains in 2013.Steady job gains are putting more people to work and enabling them to buy a home. And rising prices should encourage more owners to sell their homes. A larger supply of available homes would likely boost sales.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged at 0.7 point. The fee for a 15-year loan rose to 0.7 point from 0.6 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage fell to 2.51 percent from 2.55 percent. The fee increased to 0.5 point from 0.4 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage slipped to 3.08 percent from 3.12 percent. The fee held at 0.5 point.	2014-02-06

In December, construction had fallen 4.8 percent. The declines in both months were blamed largely on the weather.ADVERTISEMENTApplications for building permits fell in January for a third month, dropping 5.4 percent to a rate of 937,000.For all of 2013, housing construction rose 17.7 percent to 976,000 units, the best showing since 2007.

(AP Photo/David Goldman, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  A private survey shows U.S. businesses added the most jobs in a year in December, powered by a big gain in construction jobs. The figures add to evidence that the economy gained momentum at the end of 2013.Payroll processor ADP said Wednesday that companies added 238,000 jobs in December, up slightly from 229,000 in the previous month. Novembers figures were revised higher.ADVERTISEMENTConstruction firms added 48,000 jobs in December, the most since 2006.The ADP numbers cover only private businesses and often diverge from the governments more comprehensive report. But both reports have shown a solid pickup in hiring since the summer.Last month, the Labor Department said private businesses added 203,000 jobs in November. The Labor Department will report on December job growth Friday.Economists forecast that the government report will show employers added 196,000 jobs last month. That would be similar to the healthy average gain of 200,000 jobs a month from August through November. Those increases have helped push the unemployment rate to a five-year low of 7 percent.Improvement in international trade, factory orders and consumer spending has made economists more optimistic about economic growth in the October-December quarter. Many now expect growth will be at an annual rate of 3 percent or higher, up from earlier estimates that were closer to 2 percent.	2014-01-08

Officials had questions about whether a public school is required to provide special education and related services to a disabled student who receives a voucher.Attorney general legal opinions are intended to help state officials with complicated issues.	2013-09-04

Thats down from 4.46 percent last week, the highest in two years and a full point more than a month ago.ADVERTISEMENTThe average on the 15-year mortgage fell to 3.39 percent, down from 3.50 percent last week — the highest since August 2011.Mortgage rates jumped last week after the Federal Reserve signaled it could slow its monthly bond purchases later this year if the economy keeps improving. The bond purchases have kept long-term interest rates down, making mortgages and other consumer loans cheaper. A pullback by the Fed would likely send rates higher.Despite the gains, mortgages are still low by historical standards. Low mortgage rates have helped fuel a housing recovery that has kept the economy growing modesty.In May, completed sales of previously occupied homes surpassed the 5 million mark for the first time in 3½ years. And those sales could rise further in June because the number of people who signed contracts to buy homes rose last month to the highest level since December 2006. Theres generally a one- to two-month lag between a signed contract and a completed sale.Greater demand, along with a tight supply of homes for sale, has driven up home prices. Its also led to more home construction, which has created more jobs and contributed to economic growth.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country at the beginning of the week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was 0.7 point this week, down from 0.8 last week.

Thats the highest percentage in more than 12 months. Most respondents dont expect the new health care law or the Federal Reserves easing of its stimulus policies to have a major impact on business, either. However only 37 percent expect to create jobs in the next six months, the same as in NABEs October survey.ADVERTISEMENTFor the fourth quarter, only about a quarter of respondents said their companies expanded payrolls. Those most likely to report increased hiring were from the manufacturing, finance, insurance and real estate sectors.The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent in December, its lowest point in more than five years. But that wasnt because people found jobs. Rather, they stopped looking for work altogether, making them no longer counted as unemployed.About 70 percent of those who responded to NABEs survey predict that the economy will grow between 2.1 and 3 percent this year. That too is little changed from October, but it is more optimistic than the 2.3 percent growth forecast by the Fed. On Thursday, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators rose modestly in December, suggesting that growth will remain steady early this year.The survey results "suggest that economic growth accelerated to a moderate pace during the fourth quarter of 2013 from its modest pace the previous quarter," said NABE President Jack Kleinhenz, principal and chief economist at Kleinhenz and Associates in Cleveland, in a statement.The survey, released Monday, analyzed responses given between Dec. 19 and Jan. 6 from members with companies employing anywhere from 1 to more than 1,000 workers.	2014-01-27

Total hiring declined 4.3 percent to 4.3 million.ADVERTISEMENTA separate report Friday showed employers added just 138,000 net jobs in March, well below Februarys 332,000.

Thats the highest level on record.ADVERTISEMENTA category that covers student loans and auto loans grew $16 billion following an $18.3 billion gain in December.Consumers barely increased credit card debt in January, when Social Security taxes rose and lowered take-home pay for most workers. A measure of credit card debt grew only $106.1 million after a $3.2 billion drop in December.Credit card debt remains 17.2 percent below the peak set in June 2008. Analysts suspect consumers will stay cautious with their plastic this year, largely because of the tax increase.The tax increase will leave a person earning $50,000 with about $1,000 less to spend in 2013. A household with two high-paid workers will have up to $4,500 less.Still, other factors could offset the rise in taxes.The job market has improved and pay is slowing increasing for many workers. The economy created 200,000 jobs a month from November through January, up from 150,000 in the previous three months.On Friday, the government will issue the February jobs report. Analyst forecast that employers added 152,000 jobs last month, although recent data suggest hiring may have been stronger.The stock market has also surged this year, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average this week to a record high. And a housing recovery has help lift home prices.A separate Fed report Thursday showed Americans have regained the wealth they lost to the Great Recession and are increasingly taking on more debt.Household wealth increased to $66.1 trillion in the October-December quarter, the report noted. Thats about 98 percent of the pre-recession peak. Household debt rose 2.4 percent, the sharpest gain in nearly five years.The increases in stock and home prices since then mean Americans net worth has since topped the pre-recession peak of $67.4 trillion, private economists say. Wealth had bottomed at $51.4 trillion in early 2009.Household wealth, or net worth, reflects the value of assets like homes, stocks and bank accounts minus debts like mortgages and credit cards.	2013-03-07

The Commerce Department releases the report on durable goods for November, on Tuesday, Dec. 24, 2013. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  Businesses stepped up their orders for long-lasting manufactured goods in November. And a key category that signals business investment plans climbed at the fastest pace in 10 months.The surge in orders for durable goods, which are products expected to last at least three years, was the latest evidence of a rebound in manufacturing. The gains will likely provide support for the economy into 2014.ADVERTISEMENTThe Commerce Department said Tuesday that orders for durable goods jumped 3.5 percent last month compared with October, when they had fallen 0.7 percent. The increase was led by a 21.8 percent surge in demand for commercial aircraft, which can be volatile.Core capital goods, a category that tracks business investment, rose 4.5 percent, the biggest gain since January. This category is seen as a gauge of business plans to expand and modernize and as a measure of business confidence.Last months rise in core capital goods, a category that excludes defense and aircraft, followed declines of 0.7 percent in October and 1.2 percent in September. It was the strongest gain since an 8.9 percent increase in January.Demand for transportation products rose 8.4 percent, led by a surge in commercial aircraft orders. Orders for motor vehicles and parts increased 3.3 percent. Automakers have been enjoying a banner sales year.Orders for communications equipment shot up 13 percent. Demand rose 5.3 percent for computers and 3.8 percent for machinery.Other reports have also signaled a strengthening manufacturing sector. The Institute for Supply Management has reported that its gauge of manufacturing activity rose in November at the fastest pace in 2½ years. Factories ramped up production and hiring.According to the ISM gauge, manufacturing activity has expanded for six straight months after hitting a rough patch in the spring. A separate report showed that factories increased output in November for a fourth straight month, led by a surge in auto production.The government said last week that the economy grew at a 4.1 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter. It was only the second time since the recovery began in mid-2009 that annual growth has topped 4 percent in any quarter.Economists think annual growth has slowed to between 2 percent and 2.5 percent in the current quarter, reflecting a slowing in business stockpiling. But they are growing confident that the economy will gain momentum in 2014 as the drag from tax increases and federal spending cuts enacted this year fades.Strong auto sales and a healthier housing market have boosted demand for steel and other metals, auto parts, furniture and appliances.Overseas demand for many goods has also risen as Europe has climbed out of recession, Japan is growing faster and Chinas economy, while slowing, is still expanding at a healthy pace.	2013-12-24
1148	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/07/11/june-sees-sharp-drop-in-us-homes-entering-foreclosure-process-home/	June sees sharp drop in US homes entering foreclosure process, home repossessions	LOS ANGELES –  Fewer U.S. homes entered the foreclosure process or were repossessed by banks in June, the latest sign that the nation is shaking off its housing bust hangover.Lenders initiated the foreclosure process on 57,286 homes last month, the lowest level for any month in 7½ years, foreclosure listing firm RealtyTrac Inc. said Thursday.ADVERTISEMENTForeclosure starts are on pace to reach roughly 800,000 this year, down from 1.1 million last year, the firm said.Completed foreclosures, when the lender repossesses a home, are on track to hit a half-million, or about a quarter below last years total.The trend comes as the U.S. housing recovery continues to gain strength, propelled by steady job gains, low interest rates, improving consumer confidence and growing demand for homes at a time when theres a thin supply of available homes for sale in many markets.Thats helped boost home prices, which jumped 12.2 percent in May from a year earlier — the biggest gain in seven years, according to data provider CoreLogic.Even so, foreclosures remain a potential drag on housing in many states, including Florida, Nevada, Illinois and Ohio."Halfway through 2013, it is becoming increasingly evident that while foreclosures are no longer a national problem, they continue to be a state and local market problem," said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac.Homes scheduled for auction in states like Florida, where the courts play a role in the foreclosure process, were up 34 percent in June from a year earlier, the firm said.Scheduled home auctions doubled last month in New Jersey and Florida, which also posted the highest foreclosure rate of any state — nearly three times the national average — in the first six months of the year, the firm said.Most homes lined up for public auction typically end up going back to lenders, which opens the door for the properties to be placed on the market as sharply discounted foreclosed homes later this year or in 2013.Nationally, the inventory of previously occupied homes on the market was 10 percent below prior-year levels in May, according to the National Association of Realtors. So the potential for more foreclosures going on sale will likely be welcome news to would-be homebuyers in markets where there is a tight supply of available homes.The number of homes that entered the foreclosure process in June was down 21 percent from May and about 45 percent below June 2012s total.Lenders repossessed 35,507 homes last month, down nearly 9 percent from May and a drop of 35 percent from a year earlier.Thats still short of the 25,000 or so a month that Blomquist considers the benchmark for foreclosures in a "normal" housing market.At the height of the housing boom in 2006, completed foreclosures averaged 22,000 a month. They peaked in September 2010 at 102,000.Tighter lending standards for home loans since the housing bubble burst have helped slow the pace of foreclosures.About 75 percent of the 824,292 U.S. homes in the foreclosure process as of June are tied to loans that were originated between 2004 and 2008."Thats a good sign that the lending has much improved and were not seeing high foreclosure rates on mortgages that have been taken out since 2008," Blomquist said.	2013-07-11

WASHINGTON –  Average U.S. mortgage rates rose this week but remained near historic lows. Cheaper mortgages have encouraged more home buying and refinancing.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate for the 30-year fixed mortgage edged up to 3.42 percent from 3.35 percent last week. Thats still near the average of 3.31 percent reached in November, the lowest on records dating to 1971.ADVERTISEMENTThe average on the 15-year fixed-rate loan rose to 2.61 percent from 2.56 percent last week, which was the lowest on records going back to 1991.Low mortgage rates have buttressed the housing recovery that began last year. Home sales and construction are up from a year ago, and prices are rising in most U.S. markets.A survey released Tuesday showed that U.S. home prices rose 10.5 percent in March compared with a year earlier, the biggest year-over-year gain since March 2006.The survey from Core Logic, a real estate data provider, showed that year-over-year prices have risen for 13 straight months. Prices are rising in part because more buyers are bidding on a limited supply of homes for sale.Prices rose in 46 states over the past year. Eleven states posted double-digit gains.And excluding distressed sales, which comprise foreclosures and short sales, prices rose in every state. A short sale is when a home sells for less than whats owed on the mortgage.Sales are rising in some markets hit hardest by the housing bust in part because investors are scooping up homes in hopes of turning a profit.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country on Monday through Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for 30-year mortgages was 0.7 point, unchanged from last week. The fee for 15-year loans also held steady at 0.7 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage fell to 2.53 percent from 2.56 percent last week. The fee for one-year adjustable-rate loans rose to 0.4 point from 0.3 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage increased to 2.58 percent from 2.56 percent. The fee was unchanged at 0.5 point.	2013-05-09

It was the best gain since a 0.7 percent rise in February. Income growth slowed to a 0.3 percent rise in June, weaker than Mays 0.4 percent gain.ADVERTISEMENTThe hope is that strong consumer spending will help boost a lackluster economy to stronger growth in the second half of this year. But for that to happen, economists say income growth needs to accelerate.Spending on non-durable goods was up 1.3 percent, reflecting in part rising gas prices, while demand for durable goods rose 0.8 percent, reflecting strength in auto sales.	2013-08-02

"There was no pressure."Her two younger daughters graduated from Scripps in 2008 and 2012, and "with each successive child, weve thought more about their career path and what field of study would be best," said Wo, who lives in Honolulu. "Each girls experience led the next one to being a lot more proactive," with internships and other job-related experiences.ADVERTISEMENTWos middle daughter, an economics major, even worried that her younger sisters media studies major wasnt practical. "Her sister was thinking, "Oh my God, youre watching movies?" Wo recalled with a laugh.All of Wos daughters landed jobs, but their shift in attitudes tells a bigger story. While some top-tier schools can still attract students by promising self-discovery and intellectual pursuits, many colleges have changed their emphasis in the years since the recession hit. Instead of "Follow your passion," the mantra has become more like, "Well help you get a job."Schools have revamped career centers, expanded internship programs and pushed alumni to serve as mentors. The changes are not only in response to a tough job market, but because parents are demanding that graduates be prepared for the workplace."Parents and students questions and concerns have changed just as much as society has changed," said John Fraire, vice president for student affairs and enrollment at Washington State University in Pullman, Wash. "Questions about job security, income, graduation rates — its to be expected."When Stephanie Albano worked as a student tour guide at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., she was equipped with a fact sheet on job placement rates, average salaries for graduates and other statistics. High school kids on the tours didnt ask about jobs, said Albano, whos now in law school, "but parents always did. It was the first question out there from parents. They want to make sure their kids are not going to end up moving back into their basements."Between 1966 and 2010, bachelors degrees in the humanities halved, from 14 percent of all degrees awarded to 7 percent, according to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.Sally Rubenstone, who writes CollegeConfidential.coms "Ask the Dean" column, says "there is certainly concern, particularly at the liberal arts schools where theyre worried that theyre not going to be perceived as pragmatic in a competitive job market."But a few colleges have benefited from the shift in values. "Colleges like Northeastern and Drexel are really coming up in the world because they offer co-op programs," where students spend several semesters in full-time jobs related to their studies, usually with pay, Rubenstone noted.In the last six years, Northeastern Universitys ranking on U.S. News & World Reports college survey has soared from 98 to 56. And even though Northeasterns tuition now tops $40,000 a year, applications have increased more than 40 percent since 2009, while SAT scores of incoming students have steadily risen.Spokeswoman Renata Nyul says Northeasterns co-op program is a "huge reason" for its popularity. "Our mission is to provide a real-world experience and an education thats rooted in the integration of rigorous classroom learning and real-world professional experience," she said. "Thats been the ethos of this place for a long time, but lately is seems to really resonate."Co-ops can also pave the way for permanent employment, Nyul says: "Ninety percent of our graduates are employed full-time and 87 percent are doing something related to what they majored in."While Northeasterns co-op model is a century old, many other schools proudly point to career prep programs theyve created since the recession began at the end of 2007.— Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., "totally revamped" its career services this past year, according to Beth Throne, who heads the schools new Office of Student and Post-Graduate Development, with life skills workshops on public speaking, social media, etiquette and even the art of the business meal; job-search boot camp for seniors and recent grads; and more on-campus recruiting. The school also created a database of alumni and willing parents in various fields, and students are aggressively matched to opportunities, resulting "in increased rates of employment."— At Washington College in Chestertown, Md., a "first-year career awareness" program opened for freshmen in 2009; a new externship program was launched this year; and a Wall Street program began in 2011 to connect students with alumni and others working in financial services.— At Otterbein University, in Westerville, Ohio, "5 Cardinal Experiences" was launched three years ago to connect students with internships, research and other opportunities. This fall, a job shadow program will match students with local alumni.— At Davidson College in Davidson, N.C., the Davidson Internship Challenge began three years ago, asking alumni to help students find and secure internships; it surpassed its goal of 100 internships in its first year by 17.— McDaniel College in Westminster, Md., started its Center for Experience and Opportunity in 2012 to "help prepare students for life after college," according to spokeswoman Cheryl Knauer, by helping them find internships, volunteering and service projects.— York College of Pennsylvania in 2009 opened the Center for Professional Excellence, where, according to a video shown on tours, students can learn everything from social skills to public speaking.Many colleges also now offer funding for unpaid internships so that students of limited means can afford to take them. And career-building is now a topic in freshmen seminars."Gone are the days when a second-semester senior can come into a career center for career assistance and expect to find a job immediately," said Kathy Williams, director of Gettysburg Colleges Center for Career Development in Gettsyburg, Pa., which encourages students to take externships and do job shadowing in freshman and sophomore year.Even schools that train students for specialized industries are stepping up their game. Haemoon Oh, who joined the Hospitality and Tourism Management department at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst in 2008, used its alumni network to create a program in which students could meet industry leaders. When hotel CEOs in New York and Boston were reluctant to travel to the campus in western Massachusetts, Oh told them, "Ill bring my students to you if you sponsor the trip. The concept was embraced by their corporate headquarters."But Ohs goals were broader than just connecting students to potential employers. "If our kids can have an opportunity to interact with a chairman or CEO or industry icon in an informal setting, and ask whatever they want, thats a worthwhile experience," he said. "I wanted to inspire students and give them hope and ambition, especially in a time of recession."He also began a mentoring program, handpicking students to match with alumni in senior positions."I asked them to coach the students over the phone or by email, but many have taken it further," he said, offering job shadowing and sometimes jobs. The number of employers taking part in the programs career fair has more than doubled, and many seniors are getting multiple job offers.Andrew Speno of Edmond, Okla., whos looking at colleges with his teenage son, says the expanded emphasis on jobs is "a practicality. I was a political science major in college, my wife has a piano performance degree. We had absolutely no practical workplace skills when we graduated. And we struggled."He added: "Education for educations sake is a luxury that middle-class families like us dont have any more."But Louise Duncan of Brunswick, Maine, would have preferred less talk about careers on the college tours she took with her daughter."At some schools it was so flagrant and persistent that a few times I had to hold myself back from giving the poor little tour guides a drubbing," she said. "I wanted to ask them to talk about the fascinating courses they took or the inspiring professors, or yell that I think the whole point of education is to learn interesting things."She added: "I get why theyre trying to sell it differently since liberal arts education has been attacked as poor value, but I dont think that college for most kids is supposed to be vocational training."	2013-07-09

The gains are a hopeful sign that manufacturing could help boost economic growth in the second half of the year.Manufacturing production rose 0.7 percent last month from July, the Federal Reserve said Monday. Thats the biggest increase since December. It followed a 0.4 percent decline in July.ADVERTISEMENTAutomakers increased production 5.2 percent, after a 4.5 percent decline in July. And factories stepped up production of other goods, including computers and electronics, furniture and business equipment.Overall industrial production rose 0.4 percent in August following no change in July. Mining, which includes oil production, increased but output at utilities fell for a fifth month.Factory output is the largest component of industrial production. The strong gain adds to other signs that manufacturing could be rebounding from a weak start this year.A closely watched survey from the Institute of Supply Management said U.S. manufacturing activity expanded last month at the fastest pace since June 2011. New orders rose, including demand from overseas.U.S. factories may be benefiting from a stronger global economy. The 17 countries that use the euro grew in the April-June quarter after six quarters of recession. And a private survey of purchasing managers in China found that manufacturing in that country expanded for the first time after shrining for three months. China, the worlds second-largest economy, is a major market for U.S. companies.The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the April-June quarter. Many economists predict growth is slowing to an annual rate of around 2 percent in the current July-September quarter. But they predict growth will pick up again in the final three months of this year.Analysts are also more optimistic that growth could strength next year, as the impact of tax hikes and government spending cuts fade.Federal Reserve officials begin a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Many economists expect the Fed will vote at that meeting to reduce its $85 billion per month in bond purchases, although only by small amount.

His death was announced by the World Trade Centers Association, an organization dedicated to furthering global trade that he founded in 1970 and led for four decades.ADVERTISEMENTAs director of World Trade Center Development for the Port Authority in the 1960s, Tozzoli oversaw the design and construction of the 110-story towers that were the worlds tallest buildings from their dedication in 1973 until the terrorist attack that felled them.Tozzoli was credited with bringing Japanese architect Minoru Yamasaki to the project. He also fought for the famous Windows on the World restaurant to be included in the north tower, and it was his idea to use the dirt excavated for the trade center as landfill to build Battery Park City.Current Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye called Tozzoli a groundbreaking pioneer."His dedication to the WTC site was instrumental in fostering world trade and economic development as a critical part of the Port Authoritys mission to create jobs and stimulate economic activity for the region," Foye said.Tozzoli joined the Port Authority in 1946 and spent his entire career there except for two years of military service during the Korean War. In the 1950s, he helped design the worlds first container port in Newark, N.J.Tozzoli was given the task of planning and building the World Trade Center in 1962. He coordinated construction of the massive project and then focused on leasing it."It will be a city with a working population of 50,000 and a landmark that will attract 80,000 visitors daily," Tozzoli said in an interview during that time. "The centers 10 million square feet of space will make it larger than Rockefeller Center. And its going to mean a worldwide selling job on our part to get tenants to occupy it."Tozzoli retired from the Port Authority in 1986 but maintained an office at the trade center, where the agency was headquartered. He spent three hours trapped in a staircase when terrorists set off a truck bomb in 1993.Tozzoli was about to enter the Holland Tunnel heading into Manhattan from New Jersey when hijacked planes struck the towers on Sept. 11, 2001. He saw the smoking north tower and then watched in horror as the second plane hit the south tower, destroying the project that had been his lifes work.	2013-02-07

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  The U.S. economy grew at a solid 4.1 percent annual rate from July through September, the fastest pace since late 2011 and significantly higher than previously believed. Much of the upward revision came from stronger consumer spending.The Commerce Departments final look at growth in the summer was up from a previous estimate of 3.6 percent. Four-fifths of the revision came from stronger consumer spending, primarily in the area of health care.ADVERTISEMENTThe 4.1 percent third quarter growth rate came after the economy expanded at a 2.5 percent rate in the second quarter. Much of the acceleration reflected a buildup in business stockpiles.Economists believe growth has slowed to between 2 percent and 2.5 percent in the current quarter, in part because they believe inventory growth has slowed.	2013-12-20

The increase points to modest growth in manufacturing output.Orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, increased 0.1 percent in August, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That comes after orders plummeted 8.1 percent in July, which was largely because of a steep drop in volatile commercial aircraft orders.ADVERTISEMENTThe August orders were held back by a decline in demand for defense aircraft and other military goods. That could be related to steep government spending cuts that took effect in March. Excluding defense spending, orders rose 0.5 percent.Auto factories reported a 2.4 percent increase in orders, the biggest in six months.And orders for so-called core capital goods rose 1.5 percent, after falling 3.3 percent the previous month. Core capital goods are a good measure of businesses confidence in the economy and include items that point to expansion, such as machinery and computers.Durable goods shipments rose 0.9 percent in August, after two months of declines. The shipments figures are used to calculate economic growth.Manufacturers are trying to rebound from a slump earlier this year, when weak growth overseas lowered demand for U.S. goods. Companies also spent less on large equipment. There have been signs that that factory production is picking up.Factories ramped up their output in August by the most in eight years, driven by a robust month at auto manufacturers. That suggested manufacturing could help drive growth in the second half of the year.And a survey of purchasing managers found that factories expanded in August at their fastest pace in more than two years, driven by a jump in new orders.The economy expanded at a 2.5 percent annual pace in the April-June quarter, up from 1.1 percent annual rate from January through March. Many economists expect growth is slowing in the July-September quarter to an annual rate of 2 percent pace or below.	2013-09-25

"I wasnt sure what would happen when I sent this guy my money."ADVERTISEMENTNow before you write him off as some con-artist whittling away on pre-packaged No. 2s from a farmhouse upstate you should know Rees is a sharp guy."Internet commenters have definitely made this argument before," Rees said. "Now, a pencil is a completely transparent communication tool. Theres no secret to it."As for his pencils, he began sharpening those after leaving a job as a political cartoonist to work for the 2010 Census, where he spent all day recording his findings with a No. 2 pencil."I thought theres got to be a way to get paid to sharpen pencils for people," he said.1,804 flawlessly sharpened mostly No. 2 pencils later, Rees has penned a book on his art form, collected an arsenal of different sharpeners, and taught classes to students who sharpen better than he does."Im always really simultaneously happy for them and always really intimidated," he said, "like please dont go into business against me. Youre going to crush me."But after two years of collecting pencil shavings with tweezers for his customers, Rees is nearing his breaking point.When Rees started, he hoped every busted tip would lead the writer to pay for a sharpening. Instead, most customers order Davids pencil points and display them as artwork."The whole point of the business is to remind people to appreciate yellow, No. 2 pencils because theyre really cool and interesting," he said. "And to make a ton of money."But at this point, work feels like work."You do anything long enough for money, it just starts to become a job," he said.So as he nears the nice round number of 2,000 sharpenings, Rees suggested that soon hed like to clean out his sharpeners for good, leaving the world a much duller place.Click for more from MyFoxNY.com.	2013-09-19

"I am pleased Brenna has agreed to serve in this important role, and will rely on her leadership as we continue the work and operations of my administration."Branstad is leaving on a trade mission to India and Japan on Friday. He will not name a permanent chief of staff before he returns to Iowa on Sept. 18.Findley previously worked as U.S. Rep. Steve Kings chief of staff. She was the Republican candidate for state Attorney General in 2010. She has served in the Branstad administration since January 2011. She recently drew scrutiny for attending a meeting of the Iowa Board of Medicine and advising members on how they could quickly consider banning a statewide abortion pill dispensing system.Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Scott Brennan cited Findleys experience with King and said this appointment was a sign that Branstad was growing more conservative in his choices."Steve King has been nothing but an embarrassment to Iowans - his hateful remarks and failures on leadership are completely offensive. The Governor has now appointed someone who has led the charge for King style far right extremism to run his administration, and I hope Iowans are as upset and outraged as I am," Brennan said in an emailed statement.Branstad spokesman Tim Albrecht said Findley was well qualified for the job."Brenna Findley is a smart, talented and hard-working member of the governors administration. Brennas qualifications are second to none, and politicizing an interim appointment exposes just how absurd, pathetic and desperate politics has become.

It reported last month that its foreign investment inflows from all sources fell 4 percent in 2012 compared with 2011."I think the decline in foreign direct investment that China saw last year in part reflects the investment barriers," Frisbie said in a briefing to journalists after a visit to China. He added that those obstacles were a more predominant reason than the uncertain global economic environment for U.S. businesses withholding investment.According to Chinas official investment catalog, there are ownership restrictions in nearly 100 sectors, including financial services, agriculture, cloud computing, health insurance and hospitals, refining and petrochemicals and energy-intensive industries.Frisbie said this was "moving higher up the scale of concern" for the council, which was formed 40 years ago to advocate for American companies working in China. It estimates the country is a $250 billion market for the U.S. that will only grow as Chinas middle class expands in the coming decade.The survey, published in October, garnered responses from both U.S. and China-based executives and represents the views of the councils members. It included companies involved in manufacturing, services and primary industries such as agriculture and oil and gas.Despite the overall drop in foreign investment into China last year, that from American companies still actually rose slightly, Frisbie said, although it was less than half the amount of Chinese direct investment into the U.S., which hit record levels.The council advocates stronger ties between the U.S. and China. Frisbie described the current bilateral relationship as "fairly good" and on an upward trajectory despite continuing distrust. He suggested the two sides consider holding annual presidential summits.He said it was too early to gauge the direction of reform under new Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, who becomes president in March. Washington is looking for Beijing to dilute the heavy state involvement in many sectors of Chinas economy.Among its other recommendations, the council is warning that cyber security concerns threaten the commercial relationship. Frisbie urged the two governments to address it. He steered clear of making specific recommendations other than for American companies to have the best information technology protections in place, regardless of where the cyber attacks are coming from.Last week, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that their computer systems had been infiltrated by China-based hackers, putting a spotlight on cyber intrusions that are becoming a growing economic and national security concern for Washington.	2013-02-04

1160	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/09/19/transunion-us-homeowners-increasingly-prioritizing-mortgage-payments-as-home/	TransUnion: US homeowners increasingly prioritizing mortgage payments as home values rise	LOS ANGELES –  The steady rise in U.S. home values is increasingly motivating homeowners to make paying their mortgage on time a priority, according to a new study.Credit reporting agency TransUnion said Thursday that it examined late-payment rates between 2009 and 2012 on mortgages, credit cards and auto loans among consumers with the three types of financial obligations.ADVERTISEMENTThe study, which looked at payment data culled from about 20 million consumers a month, found that consumers were more likely to make timely payments on their auto loans ahead of credit cards and home loans.But through last year, coinciding with a gradual increase in home values, the late-payment rate on mortgages nearly closed the gap with credit cards.That suggests a return to behavior before the housing bust, when financially distressed borrowers typically prioritized paying their mortgage ahead of credit cards, TransUnion said."With continued improvements in housing prices, its probable that by the end of 2013 we will see the majority of consumers paying their mortgages ahead of their credit cards," said Steve Chaouki, a group vice president in TransUnions financial services business unit.During the last recession, many Americans reined in spending in favor of paying off debt, particularly credit card balances. The housing downturn also prompted many homeowners to make paying their credit card accounts on time a priority ahead of other financial obligations, such as their mortgage payments.The mortgages examined in the study and found to be at least 30 days overdue had a late-payment rate of 3.83 percent in 2009. That improved to 1.91 percent last year, TransUnion said.Thats nearly as low as the late-payment rate on overdue credit cards in the study, which stood at 1.82 percent last year, down from 2.82 percent in 2009.Among the overdue auto loans in the study, the late-payment rate fell to 0.88 percent last year, down from 1.34 percent in 2009, the firm said.The study also compared the spread between late-payment rates for mortgages and credit cards to changes in U.S. home prices over the same period. It found that in markets like Los Angeles, where home prices saw a pronounced drop following a sharp upswing during the housing boom, there was a bigger gap in late-payment rates between mortgages and credit cards than in markets like Dallas, where home values were more stable, by comparison.That suggests homeowners who saw the value of their homes decline sharply were less inclined to miss credit card payments at the expense of paying their home loan on time.Overall, homeowners are doing a better job of making timely mortgage payments. The national late-payment rate on home loans in the second quarter sank to the lowest level in five years.The last time the mortgage-delinquency rate was lower was the third quarter of 2008, a time when home prices were sliding and the U.S. economy was in recession.Even so, the mortgage-delinquency rate is still above the 1 percent to 2 percent average historical range, an indication that many homeowners still are struggling to make their payments.	2013-09-19

They include items that point to expansion — such as machinery, computers and heavy trucks — while excluding volatile orders for aircraft and defense. The July setback was expected to be temporary.Orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, declined 7.4 percent, a slightly bigger drop than the 7.3 percent fall estimated in a preliminary report last week. It was the biggest decline since a 12.9 percent fall in August 2012. Orders for nondurable goods, items such as chemicals, food and paper, rose 2.4 percent in July after a 0.5 percent decline in June.Excluding the volatile transportation category, factory goods orders were up 1.2 percent.The big drop in core capital goods orders suggests the third quarter is off to a weaker start than some had hoped. While economists cautioned that its just one month of data, a few lowered their growth estimates for the July-September quarter after seeing the durable goods report. Some believe that growth may only come in around 1.9 percent for the current quarter, a drop from previous estimates of 2.5 percent growth.Overall manufacturing has slumped this year, hurt by weakness overseas that has dragged on U.S. exports. But there have been signs that factory activity could pick up in the second half of the year.But the Institute for Supply Management reported Tuesday that its closely watched gauge of manufacturing activity rose in August to a reading of 55.7, up from 55.4 in July. That was the highest level since June 2011 and offered encouragement that manufacturing may be starting to pull out of its slowdown.The economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the April-June quarter.	2013-09-05

The forecast says the country isnt creating enough good jobs.However, the forecast also says a housing market recovery should boost the GDP over the next two years and bring down unemployment, falling to 6.9 percent next year.California, meanwhile, outperformed the nation in job growth during a 12-month period that ended in April. One reason is demand for California goods, such as computers.	2013-06-05

Car sales have risen steadily this year after reaching a five year high in 2012.Overall industrial production, which includes mining and utilities, rose 0.7 percent in February. That is the most in three months. Utility output jumped 1.6 percent while mining output, which covers oil and gas drilling, fell 0.3 percent, the third straight decline.The report adds to recent signs that manufacturing is picking up.A closely watched index of U.S. manufacturing activity increased in February for the third straight month. Big increases in new orders and production pushed the Institute for Supply Managements index to its highest level in 20 months.Auto sales, meanwhile, reached their highest level in five years in 2012 and are still rising. New car and truck sales rose 4 percent in February from a year earlier to an annual pace of 15.4 million. Thats a big improvement from sales of only 10.4 million in 2009. Its still short of the pre-recession peak of 17 million in 2005. Auto makers are expected to have boosted output last month to keep up with the sales.Manufacturers also stepped up hiring last month, adding 14,000 jobs. The industry has added 39,000 in just the past three months.Increasing factory output is contributing to an improved outlook for the economy this year. Americans are spending more, despite higher Social Security taxes and a sharp increase in gas prices. Retail sales rose in February at a healthy pace.The job market is also gaining steam. Employers have added more than 200,000 jobs per month in the past four months, nearly double the average last spring. Thats pushed the unemployment rate down to a four-year low of 7.7 percent.As a result many economists are more optimistic about growth in the January-March quarter. Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, raised his forecast for first quarter growth to an annual rate of 3 percent, up from only 1.5 percent.	2013-03-15
1176	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/14/growth-in-us-canadian-oil-production-reducing-imports-pushing-middle-eastern/	Growth in US, Canadian oil production reducing imports, pushing Middle Eastern oil to Asia	NEW YORK –  The surge in oil production in the U.S. and Canada and shrinking oil consumption in the developed world is transforming the global oil market.The threat of chronic oil shortages is all but gone, U.S. dependence on Middle Eastern oil will continue to dwindle, and oil will increasingly flow to the developing economies of Asia, according to a five-year outlook published Tuesday by the International Energy Agency.ADVERTISEMENTThe changes will have "significant consequences for the global economy and oil security," the IEA said.The report paints a picture of a world with plenty of oil to meet modestly growing demand. Where the oil is coming from, and where it is going, is changing dramatically, according to the IEA, an energy security and research organization based in Paris that serves 28 oil-importing countries, including the U.S.The report does not address oil prices directly, but analysts do not expect the changing oil market dynamics to lead to sharply lower oil or gasoline prices. The abundance of oil does, however, greatly reduce the risk of sustained price surges that curtail economic growth.The chief impetus for the changing world oil picture is the increase in production in the U.S. The U.S. created the world oil market more than a century ago and is the worlds biggest consumer, but domestic production was thought to be in permanent decline. Then drillers, inspired by high prices and armed with improving technology, learned how to produce oil from previously inaccessible rock under several U.S. states.U.S. production reached 7.4 million barrels per day early this month, 48 percent higher than the average production in 2008 and the highest its been since February of 1992. The IEA expects U.S. production to reach 9.1 million barrels per day by 2018. The U.S. last produced that much oil in 1972.Production is also projected to rise in Canada and elsewhere in the Americas, such as Brazil and Columbia. At the same time, oil demand in the U.S. and other developed nations is expected to fall slightly, a result of improved vehicle efficiency and weak economic growth. That means the U.S. will be able to satisfy most of its own needs with domestic production and oil from neighbors — and that could have geopolitical implications."It will affect relationships between countries. Most leaders believe they have to be nice to whoever they buy their oil from," says Michael Levi, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of a recent book on the U.S. energy boom called The Power Surge.U.S. petroleum imports have fallen by 22 percent since hitting a record in the middle of the last decade.With lower demand in the West and higher production in the Americas, much less oil will flow from the Middle East to Europe and the United States. Instead, Middle Eastern oil will head to Asia and likely strengthen economic and political ties between the two regions.Levi warns against overestimating the political and economic benefits of lower U.S. imports, however. Because the oil market is global, a supply disruption in the Middle East would send prices higher everywhere — including for U.S. consumers — even if the U.S. imports no oil from the Middle East. For that reason, the U.S. will still need to help maintain stability in the region.Supplies in the Middle East will also change. Iraqs production capacity is expected to grow quickly, by 1.6 million barrels per day to 4.8 million barrels per day by 2018. Meanwhile, Irans capacity is expected to decline by 1 million barrels per day, to 2.4 million barrels per day, as a result of Western sanctions imposed on the countrys oil and financial markets. Saudi Arabia will continue to dominate production in the region.Other members of the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries, such as Venezuela and African nations, will struggle to keep up, because of political instability and difficulty attracting investment in new oil fields.OPEC may soon face some difficult decisions if new supplies from non-OPEC countries push prices lower. The group restricts production by its members in order to keep global oil prices high. In recent years, prices have been so high that member countries have been able to produce all they want. If prices fall, however, members could be asked to cut production at a time when those countries desperately need oil revenue to fund domestic programs."Pressure on OPEC is going to crank up," says Judith Dwarkin, Chief Economist at ITG Investment Research.It is unclear whether, or how far, prices will fall. The new oil in the Americas is expensive to produce because it is found in difficult locations — deep offshore, trapped in oil sands, or in tightly-packed rock. Lower prices would force drillers to quickly pull back, or risk losing money. That would reduce supplies, and send prices back up. Analysts say that if prices fall below $70 per barrel for a sustained period, investment in the most expensive new projects will slow.Average oil prices have been remarkably flat over the last three years. The price of oil averaged $95 per barrel in 2011, $94 in 2012 and $94 so far this year. That has kept average U.S. gasoline prices relatively stable too — averaging between $3.51 and $3.63 per gallon over the last three years. Tuesdays report had little effect on daily oil markets — oil closed down less than one percent to just over $94 per barrel.Dwarkin expects oil prices to average near $90 a barrel for at least the next two years.Oil demand is shifting as much as oil supply. Developing countries will soon, as a group, consume more oil than developed countries for the first time, according to the IEA.The Middle East and Asia will need more oil as their economies grow. At the same time, the historically big oil consumers — the U.S., Europe and Japan — will use less. Overall, global demand is expected to rise 1.2 percent per year over the next five years.While the IEA report doesnt address the oil market after 2018, it does suggest that the technology that helped lead to a boom in oil production in the U.S. will eventually help other countries produce more oil."It is impossible to ignore the possibility that current non-conventional technologies, as they spread and get both perfected and mainstreamed, could lead to a wholesale reassessment of global reserves," the report says.Follow Jonathan Fahey on Twitter at http://twitter.com/JonathanFahey .	2013-05-14

The combined company would be based in Fort Worth.ADVERTISEMENT"By any stretch of the imagination, having what the press refers to as the Worlds Largest Airline based in Texas, makes our state more competitive," James Oberwetter of Dallas and Bill Thornton of Fort Worth wrote Monday in an open letter to Abbott.The pressure on Abbott from the business community comes just weeks after the Republican announced his candidacy for governor in the 2014 election.Separately, the Allied Pilots Association said in an advertisement in Mondays Dallas Morning News that American is "a powerful economic engine" in Texas but needs the merger to compete with bigger United and Delta.The union asked Abbott, "Are you opposed to having a leading global carrier in Fort Worth? Considering everything at stake — including the large number of jobs and the tax revenues they generate — that doesnt make any sense."Abbotts office didnt respond immediately. Last week, Abbott wrote in a column for the same newspaper arguing that the merger was designed to eliminate competition and raise prices.Abbott and AGs in five other states joined a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit that seeks to block the merger on antitrust grounds. The airlines vowed to fight back in court, and they left open the possibility of negotiating a settlement that would allow the deal to go ahead.	2013-08-19

A growing number of buyers are bidding on a tight supply of homes, driving prices higher and helping the housing market recover.The Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller home price index released Tuesday also showed that all 20 cities measured by the report posted annual gains for the third straight month.ADVERTISEMENTAnd prices rose in 15 cities in March from February. Thats up from only 11 in the previous month. The monthly figures arent seasonally adjusted and may reflect the beginning of the spring buying season.Annual prices rose in Phoenix by 22.5 percent, the biggest gain among cities. It was followed by San Francisco (22.2 percent) and Las Vegas (20.6 percent).New York City had the smallest annual increase at 2.6 percent, followed by Cleveland at 4.8 percent.The index covers roughly half of U.S. homes. It measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The March figures are the latest available.The U.S. housing market is steadily recovering, buoyed by solid job gains and near-record low mortgage rates. Sales of new homes rose in April to nearly a five-year high. And sales of previously occupied homes ticked up in April to the highest level in three and a half years.Despite the gains, a limited number of homeowners are putting their houses on the market. Thats helped lift home prices. And its made builders more willing to ramp up construction. Applications for building permits rose in April to the highest level in nearly five years.The recovery is creating more construction jobs and bolstering the economy in other ways.

The Commerce Department reports on U.S. factory orders in December on Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2014. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  U.S. manufacturers saw orders for their products decline in December by the largest amount in five months although the setback for a key category that tracks business investment was not as large as first reported.Orders to U.S. factories fell 1.5 percent in December, the biggest drop since July, with much of the weakness coming from a plunge in aircraft orders, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Orders had risen 1.5 percent in November after a 0.5 percent October decrease.ADVERTISEMENTOrders in a closely watched category that serves as a proxy for business investment declined 0.6 percent, a smaller fall than the 1.3 percent drop estimated in a preliminary report last week. The decrease followed a sizable 3 percent jump in November, an increase spurred by an expiring tax break.Demand for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, fell 4.2 percent, slightly less than the 4.3 percent preliminary estimate. Orders for nondurable goods such as chemicals, paper and food rose 1.1 percent in December following a 0.4 percent November gain.Analysts say part of the weakness in December reflected a temporary slowdown following a rush to purchase capital goods in November to take advantage of expiring federal tax breaks.Orders for all of 2013 totaled $5.82 trillion, up 2.5 percent from 2012, as manufacturing continued to recover from the Great Recession.For December, demand for commercial aircraft, a volatile category, fell 17.5 percent after having risen 21.1 percent in November. While the drop in airplane orders led the declines, there was weakness in a number of categories. Orders for iron and steel fell 10 percent while demand for construction machinery was down 2.9 percent and demand for computers and other electronic products fell 6.3 percent.The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, said Monday that its index of manufacturing activity fell to 51.3 in January from 56.5 in December. It was the lowest reading since May although any reading above 50 signals growth in manufacturing.The January performance of the ISM index suggests that U.S. manufacturing slowed at the beginning of this year.Auto sales have decelerated and businesses are spending cautiously on machinery and other large factory goods.The slowdown could mean that economic growth in the first three months of this year will get less support from manufacturing.But some economists said that the weak ISM reading may reflect unusually bad weather in January.The Federal Reserve reported that factory output in December rose for a fifth straight month. Manufacturers produced more cars, trucks and appliances in December.	2014-02-04

But orders that signal business confidence in the economy fell.The Commerce Department says factory orders increased 1.7 percent in September from August. The gain was driven by a 57.7 percent jump in demand for aircraft.ADVERTISEMENTBut so-called core capital goods, which include machinery and electronics and are good measure of business investment plans, fell 1.3 percent in September.

The gains raise hopes for a stronger economy in the second half of 2013.The Labor Department says the economy added 70,000 more jobs in May and April than initially reported.ADVERTISEMENTThe unemployment rate stayed at 7.6 percent because more people started looking for work. The government counts people as unemployed only if they are looking for work.The economy has added an average of 202,000 jobs a month for the past six months, up from 180,000 in the previous six. That suggests businesses are growing more confident in the economy.If the gains continue, the Federal Reserve might start to scale back its bond purchases before the year ends.	2013-07-05

Imports fell 2.8 percent to $223.1 billion, led by a 4.4 percent drop in foreign petroleum. Crude oil imports averaged just 7 million barrels per day, the lowest since March 1996.A smaller trade gap can boost overall economic growth as American companies earn more from overseas sales while U.S. consumers and businesses spend less on foreign products.	2013-05-02

Prices are rising in part because more buyers are bidding on a limited supply of homes for sale.ADVERTISEMENTPrices increased in 46 states over the past year — 11 of them posting double-digit gains. And when excluding distressed sales, which include foreclosures and short sales, prices rose in every state. A short sale is when a home sells for less than what is owed on the mortgage.Nevada led all states with a 22.2 percent annual gain. It was followed by California (17.2 percent), Arizona (16.8 percent), Idaho (14.5 percent) and Oregon (14.3 percent).Home prices also rose 1.9 percent in March from February, signaling a solid start to the spring buying season. And 88 of the 100 largest cities reported price gains compared with a year earlier, down slightly from 92 in February.Prices in Phoenix rose 18.8 percent in March from a year earlier, the largest gain of any city. Los Angeles, Riverside, Calif., Atlanta and Houston posted the next largest gains.Steady job creation and record-low mortgage rates have boosted home sales and construction in the past year. More demand, along with a limited supply of homes for sale, has pushed prices higher.The number of homes for sale fell nearly 17 percent in March compared with a year ago. That supply would be exhausted in about 4.7 months at the current sales pace. Thats below the 6 months of supply that is typical in a healthy market.Rising home prices can help sustain the housing rebound and lift the economy. More potential homebuyers may seek to purchase a house before prices rise further. And homeowners are more likely to put their houses on the market once they expect a good price.Higher home values also boost Americans overall net worth. That can encourage consumers to spend more, driving more economic growth. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of economic activity.	2013-05-07

It "suggests further healing in the labor markets," Sal Guatieri, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.Stronger hiring is one of the reasons economists expect growth is probably picking up in 2013 after a disappointing October-December quarter, when the economy barely grew.Weekly applications are a proxy for layoffs. When they decline, it suggests companies are cutting fewer workers and may be more willing to hire.Applications have fallen steadily in recent weeks. The four-week average has declined almost 11 percent since November. At the same time, employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs per month from November through January. Thats up from about 150,000 in the previous three months.In January, the economy added 157,000 jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent in December. Economists think the rate will slowly decline if hiring continues at last years monthly pace of 180,000. The unemployment rate fell 0.7 percentage point in 2012.The drop in applications suggests companies will add more jobs in February than in January, economists said.The hiring occurred even as growth stumbled in the final three months of the year. The economy barely expanded, growing only 0.1 percent at an annual rate, in the October-December quarter. Thats a sharp slowdown from the third quarter, when the economy grew 3.1 percent.Still, the outlook for the U.S. economy brightened this week after reports showed that Americans are more confident and are buying more new homes. Home prices are also rising steadily, and banks are lending more. Such improvements suggest that the economy is resilient enough to withstand automatic spending cuts that are scheduled to kick in Friday.The spending cuts could slow economic growth and cost 700,000 jobs, according to the Congressional Budget Office. They could also reduce unemployment benefit checks for those out of work for more than six months by about 11 percent, according to the National Employment Law Project. Benefits average about $320 per week nationwide.Growth will likely pick up a bit in the January-March quarter to an annual rate of close to 2 percent percent, analysts forecast. Thats better than the fourth quarter but below last years expansion of 2.2 percent.Meanwhile, a total of nearly 5.8 million people received unemployment aid in the week ended Feb. 9, the latest data available. Thats up about 180,000 from the previous week. That figure has fallen from nearly 7.5 million a year ago, partly because some of aid recipients have gotten jobs, while others have used up all the benefits available.__Follow Chris Rugaber on Twitter at https://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber	2013-02-28

Exports rose, businesses stocked up, home construction increased and state and local governments spent at the fastest pace in four years.The Commerce Department says growth increased from a 2.5 percent annual rate in the April-June period to the fastest pace in a year.ADVERTISEMENTConsumers stepped up spending on goods. But overall spending weakened from the second quarter because service spending was essentially flat, in part because of a cooler summer that lowered utility spending.The third-quarter outcome was nearly a full percentage point stronger than most economists had predicted.

The annual gain was the biggest since March 2006. Prices have now increased on an annual basis for 12 straight months, underscoring the recoverys steady momentum.ADVERTISEMENTThe gains were broad-based. Prices rose in 47 of 50 states and in all but four of the nations 100 largest metro areas. Delaware, Alabama and Illinois were the only states to report price declines.CoreLogics measure of national prices also rose 0.5 percent in February from January. Thats a solid increase during the winter months, when sales typically slow.An increase in home sales has helped lift prices. In February, sales of previously owned homes reached the highest level in more than three years. Still, much of the demand has come from investors. Sales to first-time buyers remain below healthy levels.Another reason prices are rising is the supply of available homes for sale remains extremely low. In January, it reached a 13-year low.The supply of homes for sale did rise in February for the first time in 10 months. That suggests more people are gaining confidence in the housing recovery, which could help ease supply concerns and drive sales higher in the coming months.The price gains were concentrated in the West, according to CoreLogic. The states with the biggest price gains were Nevada, where prices rose 19.3 percent, followed by Arizona, with 18.6 percent, and California, with 15.3 percent.Hawaii and Idaho rose 14.6 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively.The cities with the biggest gains were Phoenix, Los Angeles, Riverside, Calif., Atlanta and New York.Nationwide, home values were still down more than 26 percent from their peak in April 2006 through February, CoreLogic said.Steady increases in prices help fuel the housing recovery. They encourage some homeowners to sell homes and entice some would-be buyers to purchase homes before prices rise further.Higher prices can also make homeowners feel wealthier. That can encourage more consumer spending, which drives 70 percent of economic activity.	2013-04-03

Caterpillar lowered its expectations for full year sales and profits because its mining business is slowing. Sales of Caterpillar-branded mining machines will drop by half this year, the company said on Monday.ADVERTISEMENTCaterpillar said mining customers placed big orders for gear last year, just as mining profits fell, so now those customers are cutting back. Dealers who would normally be stocking up on Caterpillar gear to get ready for a busy summer instead cut inventory during the first quarter.Caterpillar has already started cutting costs. On April 5 it said it would lay off more than 460 employees at a mining truck plant in Decatur, Ill. Caterpillar also announced mining-related layoffs in Milwaukee and plans to cut 1,300 of 3,400 jobs at a plant near Brussels that makes excavators, loading vehicles, and engine parts. This years capital spending — which covers big-ticket items like factories and computer systems — will fall below $3 billion, down from $3.4 billion last year.Net income dropped to $882 million, or $1.31 per share. Revenue fell 17 percent to $13.21 billion, from $15.98 billion a year ago. Both missed analyst expectations. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting a profit of $1.36 per share on revenue of $13.79 billion.It also cut its 2013 guidance. Caterpillar now expects to earn $7 per share, down from $7 to $9 previously. It forecast revenue of $57 billion to $61 billion, down from $60 billion to $68 billion. Analysts were expecting a 2013 profit of $7.67 per share on revenue of $62.48 billion.There were some bright spots. Sales in China rose compared to a year ago.

Steady gains in productivity could dissuade companies from ramping up hiring.The Labor Department says productivity increased at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, up slightly from a 1.8 percent rate in the previous quarter. The second quarter figure was lower than the 2.3 percent rate previously estimated.ADVERTISEMENTProductivity measures the amount of output per hour worked. Greater productivity raises living standards because it enables companies to pay workers more without spurring inflation.

Many of those homes wound their way through the often lengthy process and ended up becoming bank-owned properties. Home repossessions, however, were down 29 percent from May last year, reflecting the long-term downward trend.Banks also started the foreclosure process on more homes last month. Foreclosure starts rose 4 percent from April, but were down 33 percent versus May last year, the firm said.The increases come as the U.S. housing market continues to gain strength, propelled in part by growing demand for homes at a time when theres a thin supply of available homes for sale in many markets.That dynamic has helped push home prices higher. They climbed nationally on an annual basis by 12.1 percent in April, the biggest gain since February 2006, according to data provider CoreLogic.The combination of a tight inventory of homes for sale and rising prices makes for an opportune market for banks."Home prices are rising and demand is stronger, so they can recoup more of their losses when selling a bank-owned home, and in most cases should be able to sell relatively quickly," said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac.The prospect of more bank-owned homes hitting the market also is good news for homebuyers struggling with the short supply of available homes. But not so great for homeowners, Blomquist said."For homeowners who are current or own their homes outright, this could slow down the recent rapid rise in home price appreciation, which could mean the value of their home does not go up as quickly in the short term," he said.Thats an unwelcome development, particularly for homeowners who are underwater on their mortgage, or owe more than their home is worth.As of the end of March, 19.8 percent of all U.S. homes with a mortgage were underwater, according to data provider CoreLogic.Rising home prices have helped drive that number down from 21.7 percent at the end of last year, and returned roughly 850,000 homes to a state of positive equity in the first three months of this year.All told, 38,946 homes were taken back by lenders last month. Repossessions increased on a monthly basis in 33 states, including North Carolina, Oregon and Wisconsin.At the current pace, the nation is on track to finish the year with about a half million completed foreclosures, down from 670,000 last year, Blomquist said.Foreclosure starts totaled 72,698 homes. They increased on a monthly basis in 26 states and rose on an annual basis in 14 states, including Maryland, Connecticut, Hawaii and Arkansas.Florida led the nation last month with an overall foreclosure rate nearly three times the national average. Rounding out the top three were Nevada and Ohio.	2013-06-13

Meanwhile, more homeowners are keeping up with their mortgage payments.Thats led to fewer homes entering the foreclosure pipeline.Foreclosure starts totaled 747,728 last year. Thats down 33 percent from a year earlier and the lowest annual level since 2006, before the housing bubble burst.All told, foreclosure starts fell in 37 states, including California, Arizona, Colorado and Georgia, but posted annual increases in 13 states, including Maryland, Arkansas, New Jersey, Connecticut and New York, the firm said."Foreclosure starts are a leading indicator that were getting back to normal, and those are back to normal, back to 2006 levels," said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac.While also down sharply, completed foreclosures — when a home ends up repossessed by a lender — have further to go before returning to normal levels, Blomquist added.Banks took back 462,970 U.S. homes last year, down 31 percent from 2012 and the lowest level since 2007, RealtyTrac said. Foreclosures peaked in 2010 at 1.05 million and have been declining ever since.Completed foreclosures declined on an annual basis in 38 states, including California, Texas, Arizona, Georgia and Michigan. They increased in a dozen states, including Maryland, Arkansas, Washington, New York and Oklahoma.As of December, more than 1.2 million properties nationwide were in some stage of the foreclosure process or owned by banks, but not yet sold. Thats a decline of 19 percent from a year earlier and 44 percent below their peak of more than 2.2 million homes in December 2010, the firm said.Most of the homes in some stage of foreclosure are tied to mortgages that were taken out between 2004 and 2008.As 2013 drew to a close, Florida remained the nations foreclosure hotbed. The state had 306,018 homes in some stage of foreclosure or owned by banks in December. That amounts to a quarter of the national total.	2014-01-16

Low mortgage rates have helped support the slowly recovering housing market.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on the 30-year loan increased to 3.56 percent from 3.53 percent last week. Thats still near the 3.31 percent reached in November, which was the lowest on record dating to 1971.ADVERTISEMENTThe average rate on the 15-year fixed mortgage stayed at 2.77 percent for a third straight week. The record low is 2.63 percent.The cheap mortgages that are encouraging more people to buy or refinance could also help sustain the economys recovery this year. Increased sales are helping lift home prices, which tend to make consumers feel wealthier and more likely to spend. And when homeowners refinance, it typically leads to lower loan payments and more spending. Consumer spending drives nearly 70 percent of economic activity.Sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. rose in January to the second-highest level in three years, the National Association of Realtors reported Thursday.Analysts say the pace of purchases would be higher still if more homes were available. The supply of homes for sale dropped to nearly an eight-year low in January. The limited supply has boosted demand for construction, which has made builders more confident.Still, the housing market has a long way to go to a full recovery. And many people are unable to take advantage of the low rates, either because they cant qualify for stricter lending rules or they lack the money for larger down payment requirements.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country on Monday through Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for 30-year loans was unchanged at 0.8 point. The fee for 15-year loans also remained at 0.8 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage increased to 2.65 percent from 2.61 percent last week. The fee for one-year adjustable-rate loans rose to 0.4 point from 0.3.The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage was steady at 2.64 percent.

WASHINGTON –  Ben Bernanke is intensifying speculation that this year will be his last as Federal Reserve chairman by deciding to skip the Feds annual August conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo.Jackson Hole has long been a high-profile platform for speeches by Fed chairmen. Since taking over the Fed in 2006, Bernanke has been the marquee speaker each year. In 2010, he used his speech to signal that the Fed could launch another bond-buying program. Stock prices jumped in response to his remarks.ADVERTISEMENTHis second four-year term will end in January, and neither he nor President Barack Obama has signaled whether Bernanke will serve a third term.The Jackson Hole retreat, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, will be held Aug. 22-24. A Fed spokesman said Monday that Bernanke wont attend because of a "personal scheduling conflict." The spokesman didnt elaborate.Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon and author of the FedWatch blog, said Bernankes decision suggests that hell leave the Fed in January."I wonder if that indicates what we all believe," Duy said.All eyes at the conference will likely instead focus on the Feds vice chair, Janet Yellen, who is widely considered the front-runner to succeed Bernanke. Yellen, who previously led the San Francisco Fed, was appointed vice chair by Obama. Yellen has been a vocal supporter of Bernankes low interest rate policies, and her selection would suggest that the Fed would continue those policies.And if Yellen is the keynote speaker at Jackson Hole this year, "that would just confirm her front-runner status," said Zach Pandl, an economist at Columbia Management, an asset management firm.Pandl said its even possible Bernanke could inform the White House of his intention to leave, and Obama could publicly tap Yellen to succeed him, before Jackson Hole.About 140 central bankers, economists, academics and government officials attend the annual conference, which is in its 37th year. In 2010, Bernanke used his speech to list the Feds options for stimulating a weak economy, including a second round of Fed bond purchases to try to keep borrowing costs low. That was the approach Bernanke eventually announced two months later.Several of Bernankes comments this year have caused observers to speculate that he is ready to leave after eight grueling years, which included the financial crisis and Great Recession, and likely resume teaching at Princeton University.Asked at a news conference last month about his plans, Bernanke said, "I dont think that Im the only person in the world who can manage the exit" from the Feds record-low-rate policies and $3 trillion in bond holdings. The Fed has vastly expanded its portfolio through bond purchases intended to keep rates low to encourage borrowing, spending and investing.In congressional testimony in February, the normally circumspect Bernanke flashed impatience over criticism that the Fed under his leadership has escalated the risk of high inflation. Responding to a question from Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, Bernanke said, "None of the things you said are accurate.""He didnt sound like someone who wanted to stick around in the job much longer," Duy said.This years Jackson Hole conference will occur as even some members of the Feds policy committee are pushing to end its $85 billion-a-month in bond purchases, which began last year. That pressure could intensify by the time of the Jackson Hole conference, particularly if the economy has strengthened.Bernanke said in December that the Fed would continue buying Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds until substantial progress was made in reducing unemployment. The unemployment rate remains a still-high 7.6 percent.Assuming he does leave in January, Bernankes absence from Jackson Hole would contrast with the 2005 conference, the last one before Alan Greenspan ended his 18-year tenure as Fed chief. That conference featured numerous encomiums to Greenspans achievements at the Fed. Two years later, the financial crisis pushed the country into the worst recession since the Great Depression."In hindsight, it looks like the participants at the 2005 Jackson Hole conference missed the elephant in the room, which was the growing credit bubble and instability in the financial system," Pandl said.__Follow Chris Rugaber on Twitter at https://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber	2013-04-22

The opening of Postal Service retail centers in dozens of Staples stores around the country is being met with threats of protests and boycotts by the agencys unions. The new outlets are staffed by Staples employees, not postal workers, and labor officials say that move replaces good-paying union jobs with low-wage, nonunion workers.AP/FileWASHINGTON –  The opening of Postal Service retail centers in dozens of Staples stores around the country is being met with threats of protests and boycotts by the agencys unions.The new outlets are staffed by Staples employees, not postal workers, and labor officials say that move replaces good-paying union jobs with low-wage, nonunion workers.ADVERTISEMENT"Its a direct assault on our jobs and on public postal services," said Mark Dimondstein, president of the 200,000-member American Postal Workers Union.The dispute comes as the financially struggling Postal Service continues to form partnerships with private companies, and looks to cut costs and boost revenues. The deal with Staples began as a pilot program in November at 84 stores in California, Georgia, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania as a way make it easier for customers to buy stamps, send packages or use Priority and certified mail.Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said the program has nothing to do with privatization and everything to do with customer service and driving up demand for the agencys products."The privatization discussion is a ruse," Donahoe said in an interview. "We have no interest in privatizing the Postal Service. We are looking to grow our business to provide customer convenience to postal products."Staples spokeswoman Carrie McElwee referred questions about union concerns to the Postal Service. She said the company "continually tests new products and services to better meet the needs of our customers."Union leaders fear that if the Staples program is successful, the Postal Service will want to expand it to more than 1,500 of the companys other stores. That could siphon work and customers away from nearby brick-and-mortar post offices, taking jobs from postal workers and even leading traditional post offices to close.Union leaders have been visiting Staples stores to meet with managers, asking them to share the unions displeasure with upper management.Dimondstein asked to meet with the Staples CEO Ronald Sargent, who has declined.The union plans to hold "sustained" protests this month at Staples stores in the San Francisco and San Jose, Calif., area that would be expanded elsewhere. Union officials also are considering how they can exert pressure on Staples shareholders."If Staples insists on continuing to refuse to staff those stores with postal workers, were going to urge people to take their business elsewhere," Dimondstein said.The union says its not asking to shut down the program. It wants the counters to be run by postal employees, not workers hired by Staples. The average postal clerk earns about $25 an hour, according to the union, plus a generous package of health and retirement benefits. The Staples post office counters are run by nonunion workers often making little more than the minimum wage.The Postal Service increasingly has looked to work with the private sector to help increase business. In November, it announced a lucrative deal with Amazon to begin package delivery on Sunday.The agency has struggled for years with declining mail volume, but the lions share of its financial plight stems from a 2006 congressional requirement that it make annual $5.6 billion payments to cover expected health care costs for future retirees. It has defaulted on three of those payments. The Postal Service lost $5 billion over the past year, though operating revenue rose 1.2 percent.So far, the Postal Service has rebuffed the unions demands.As far as who will staff the counters, "thats Staples business. They make their own business decisions and it has nothing to do with us," Donahoe said.Donahoe said hed like to see post office counters in every Staples store "as soon as possible." But he doesnt see them as replacing any of the 33,000 traditional post offices. He said he sees the program as an opportunity "to grow the business."James ORourke, a professor of management at the University of Notre Dame, said the Postal Service is simply following the trend of other businesses such as banks and medical clinics opening in grocery and drug stores to get more customers and save overhead costs."You cant blame the union for looking suspiciously at this move, but from the perspective of postal management and postal customers, this is all good," ORourke said.Donahoe acknowledged that it could save money in employee costs, but insisted that is not the agencys motivating force. Since 2008, the Postal Service has reduced its employees by more than 200,000, mainly through attrition."Keeping our expenses down is no different than what any other business would do," he said.Back in 1988, the Postal Service tried a similar plan to put retail units in Sears stores in Chicago and Madison, Wis. APWU members picketed Sears headquarters in Chicago, mailed thousands of letters of protest to then Sears Chairman Ed Brennan and even cut up their Sears credit cards.The pressure worked and a year later the program ended, with Sears saying it did not want to be at the center of a dispute between the Postal Service and the union. But the APWUs membership now is almost half of what it was 25 years ago, and unions dont carry the same clout they once did.Dimondstein, who took the helm of his union in November and pledges a more activist approach, insists his members will bring considerable pressure on Staples."I think we have a lot of clout," he said. "Were in every hamlet, town, city and state in the country."	2014-01-19

Thats up from 29 percent in the January-March survey. And 78 percent expect their sales to increase. Thats up from 72 percent from the previous survey.ADVERTISEMENTConsumers have kept spending this year, despite an increase in Social Security taxes. Thats helped the economy grow at a modest pace.Still, most of the CEOs dont expect growth to accelerate. They forecast growth of 2.2 percent this year, only slightly better than the 2.1 percent forecast in the first-quarter survey."CEOs see the U.S. economy still on a slow road to recovery," said Jim McNerney, chief executive of Boeing and the chairman of the Business Roundtable.The better sales outlook reflects modest growth in the United States and "continued high growth in Asia" and other emerging markets, McNerney said, offset by continuing recession in Europe.Small business owners are also a bit more optimistic, according to a separate survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, released Tuesday. The NFIBs small business optimism index rose for the second straight month to 94.4. Thats the second-highest level since the recession began in December 2007. Greater confidence in future sales and economic growth drove the increase.Employers added 175,000 jobs in May, the government said last week, nearly matching the average job gains of the past year. The unemployment rate ticked up to 7.6 percent, but for a good reason: More Americans were confident they could find work and began searching for a job.The economy grew at a solid annual rate of 2.4 percent in the first three months of the year. Consumer spending rose at the fastest pace in more than two years.Economists worry that the federal spending cuts and higher Social Security taxes, which started Jan. 1, might be slowing growth in the April-June quarter to an annual rate of 2 percent or less.

That is the biggest annual gain since May 2006. Prices rose last year in 46 of 50 states.ADVERTISEMENTHome prices also increased 0.4 percent in December from the previous month. Thats a healthy increase given that sales usually slow over the winter months.Steady increases in prices are helping fuel the housing recovery. Theyre encouraging some people to sell homes and enticing would-be buyers to purchase homes before prices rise further.Higher prices can also make homeowners feel wealthier. That can encourage more consumer spending.Most economists expect prices to keep rising this year. Sales of previously occupied homes reached their highest level in five years in 2012 and will likely keep growing. Homebuilders, encouraged by rising interest from customers, broke ground on the most new homes and apartments in four years last year.Ultra-low mortgage rates and steady job gains have fueled more demand for houses and apartments. More people are moving out into their own homes after doubling up with friends and relatives in the recession.At the same time, the number of previously occupied homes for sale has fallen to the lowest level in 11 years."All signals point to a continued improvement in the fundamentals underpinning the U.S. housing market recovery," said Anand Nallathambi, CEO of CoreLogic.The states with the biggest price gains were Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, California and Hawaii. The four states where prices fell were Delaware, Illinois, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.The housing recovery is also boosting job creation. Construction companies have added 98,000 jobs in the past four months, the best hiring spree since the bubble burst in 2006. Economists forecast even more could be added this year.Housing has been a leading driver of past recoveries. But the bursting of the housing bubble pushed a flood of foreclosed homes on the market at low prices. That made it hard for builders to compete.And a collapse in home prices left millions of homeowners owing more on their mortgages than their houses were worth. That made it difficult to sell.Now, six years after the bubble burst, those barriers are fading. Some economists forecast that housing could add a point or more to economic growth this year.	2013-02-05

Some visitors initially ignored road blocks and signs to sightsee — particularly at outlooks along a state highway through the Grand Canyon. Officials responded by closing the road and letting the public know law enforcement would be on the lookout.The impact isnt just ruining vacations. It also has brought local economies to a near standstill.	2013-10-04

The $8 socks featuring the god worshipped by many Hindu sects were described by the Philadelphia-based firm as “awesome” and an exclusive design, Philly.com reports.ADVERTISEMENTThe socks, however, caught the attention of Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, who characterized them on his blog as highly inappropriate. Zed suggested that corporations send senior executives for training in religious and cultural sensitivity before launching new advertising campaigns.Crystal Carroll, public relations manager of Urban Outfitters, apologized in response to Zed’s complaint and said the socks would be removed from the clothier’s website immediately.“We sincerely apologize if we offended the Hindu community and our customers,” Carroll said in a statement. “We appreciate Rajan Zed and the Universal Society of Hinduism for bringing this matter to our attention and for helping us understand the cultural and religious sensitivities this product carries.”Urban Outfitters is no stranger to controversial products. Earlier this year, political leaders in Kentucky called on the retailer to stop selling flasks, shot glasses and pint glasses that look like prescription pill bottles. The company was also accused by the Navajo Nation in 2012 of trademark infringement for using the tribe’s geometric prints and names without licensing. The two parties have since failed to reach a settlement in federal court.	2013-12-17

More than 20,000 boxes of Twinkies and roughly 5,000 boxes of Ding Dongs, Zingers and Orange Cupcakes — were flying off the shelves late Monday and early Tuesday.ADVERTISEMENT“The best way to compare it is this: You have your Black Friday sales and this is Twinkie Tuesday,” said Mike Siemenas, a spokesman for Jewel-Osco parent company Supervalu. “Once we received a call from Hostess asking if we would take the products, we told them we would take 100 percent of what they had. And based on the demand that the Chicago market had for Hostess products, we knew that that was the best place for them.”- Mike Siemenas, spokesman, SupervaluThe confections will be sold at regular price with no limits on how many customers can buy until the shelves are barren, Siemenas said.“Most of them have already run out of Hostess products,” he said. “The phones have been ringing steadily at our stores.”Some stores have received calls from shoppers looking to buy Twinkies or other Hostess products for relatives living as far away as Arizona, Siemenas said.Click here for a list of locations.“This will be a good Christmas present for some,” he continued. “This has definitely gotten around the country.”As of early Tuesday, the Twinkie craze continued online, with more than 1,800 items on eBay containing the word “Twinkie,” including a listing seeking $2 million for rights to the Internet domain “I like a Twinkie” and $120,000 for an unopened box of 10 Twinkies.“GET THIS ORIGINAL BOX 10 COUNT INDIVIDUALLY WRAP CAKES NOW FACTORY SEALED,” the listing reads. “YOU WONT BE ABLE TO GET IT ANYWHERE ELSE AGAIN -- ALSO GOING TO GOOD CAUSE.”On the other side of the price spectrum, other listings offered homemade Twinkie recipes for as a little as 75 cents and even shelf tags listing Twinkies for sale for $1.49. Twin packs of Twinkies, meanwhile, could be had with bids as little as $2.24.“I have for bid a Twinkie twin pack that is fresh and sell date is Dec 15th!” the listing reads. “Free shipping!”Earlier this month, a suburban Chicago restaurant gave away about 10,000 Twinkies along with more than 2,000 chocolate cupcakes as part of a promotion following Hostess’ closure announcement last month.Andres DeLeon of Babys Cheesesteak and Lemonade in Orland Park and Country Club Hills said workers piled the treats in two minivans during two trips to a Hostess outlet.

The dynamic drove mortgage delinquencies higher, peaking at nearly 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.The rate of late payments on home loans has been steadily declining over the past five quarters. At the same time, U.S. home sales and prices have been rebounding over the past two years, while foreclosures have been declining.Moderate but stable job gains, still-low mortgage interest rates, and tight supply of homes for sale have helped fuel the housing rebound. Thats also made it easier for homeowners to refinance, catch up on payments or sell their home, avoiding foreclosure.Even so, the mortgage delinquency rate is still above the 1 to 2 percent average historical range. That suggests that many homeowners still are struggling to make their payments. It also reflects that many home loans made during the housing boom remain unpaid but have yet to work their way through the foreclosure process.Loans made in the years after the housing boom are generally being paid on time, so as more of the older loans listed on banks books as unpaid get resolved, the overall mortgage delinquency rate should continue to decline, said Tim Martin, group vice president of U.S Housing for TransUnions financial services business unit."The new mortgages are still performing very well, at very low delinquency rates," Martin said. "Thats why were expecting more improvement to come."TransUnion forecasts that the national mortgage delinquency rate will drop to just under 4 percent by the end of year.All the states posted an annual drop in late-payment rates during the third quarter, with California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado and Utah registering declines of more than 30 percent.TransUnion draws its data from 52 million installment-based mortgages in the U.S.	2013-11-12

Although the report is just a snapshot, it does suggest that Cancun remains a popular tourist destination, despite headlines about violence elsewhere in Mexico. The pricing data also suggests that economically, tourism is still recovering from the recession but is on an upward swing.STRs data for the Acapulco-Morelia area, which draws on information from 13.6 percent of 29,000 rooms in 268 local properties, showed a 53 percent occupancy rate for the first quarter of 2013, up from last years 43 percent occupancy rate. That was still well below a 69 percent occupancy rate in 2007, before the recession and violence began to mar tourism in the region.

Sixty-three times this year at least one U.S. metro area has seen such a change. Like the 24-cent increase Decatur, Ill. drivers saw on Jan. 26, or the 24-cent increase in Superior, Wis. on April 30, and the 28-cent increase in Henderson, Ky. on Sept. 19.ADVERTISEMENTNot since 2008 have there been so many 20-cent changes. Last year those happened 58 times. In 2011 they happened just 21 times, and in 2010 just 7 times."Theres more and more feast or famine," says Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service and GasBuddy.com.The problem, analysts say, is a fuel system increasingly vulnerable to short-term shocks. Thats because refiners try to keep stocks of gasoline low to save money, just as other manufacturers aim to operate on a "just-in-time" inventory schedule. The nation has about 26 days worth of gasoline demand in storage, compared with 30 to 40 days worth during much of the 1980s and 1990s, according to the Energy Department. Also, there are 143 operating refineries, about half the total from 1980, so, if one has a problem, supplies quickly drop.That price whiplash has a cost. Spikes in gasoline prices are more damaging to the economy than a slow rise in prices because they undermine consumer confidence, economists say. Drivers may be pleasantly surprised when prices slide lower, like they have recently -- the national average is at $3.28, its lowest level of the year. But they dont know when the price might bounce back up, and increases are almost always sharper than decreases.  That makes it harder to budget for the daily commute, or know whether dinner out or a new appliance will be affordable.These dramatic local price swings are happening despite relatively stable oil prices and a national average gasoline price that has hovered around $3.50 per gallon for three years. In 2008, the last time local prices were this volatile, oil spiked to $145 a barrel in July, then plunged below $40 in late December as the global financial crisis sent energy markets reeling. The national average gasoline price ranged from $1.62 to $4.11 a gallon.Nowhere is it more frustrating to buy gas than in Kokomo, Ind., a flat, unassuming blue collar city surrounded by farmland 45 miles north of Indianapolis that regularly sees 10-cent or 20-cent price changes in a single day. On average, the price changes 5 cents there every day and 16 cents every week, the highest in the nation, according to GasBuddy.com.Jim Brooks, who works at a Chrysler transmission plant in town, does his best to fill up elsewhere. "If I dont have to buy gas in Kokomo, I dont," he said recently at Manjas Marathon station in Kokomo during a lunch break. He bought a soda and some chips, but not gasoline.Gas station owners set their prices based on how much it cost to buy the last shipment of wholesale gasoline, how much the next shipment will cost, and what competitors are doing. Stations typically make very little on gasoline, because they set the price as low as possible to attract people into their more profitable convenience stores.The price they pay for wholesale gasoline is determined by deals between refiners and distributors that are usually based on benchmarks set on exchanges, such as the New York Mercantile Exchange.When supplies are quick to rise or fall, it means more of what frustrates drivers: Gasoline prices that seem to jump around a few cents every time they fill up, for no rhyme or reason. This year 57 U.S. metro areas have averaged price changes of at least a dime over a week. Last year just 38 cities did, and in 2011 it was just 29 cities.Volatility is most pronounced in the four neighboring states of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Of the biggest 50 one-day swings in gasoline prices over the past three years, 41 were in those four states. Michigan is also plagued by especially high volatility. Flint, Michigan is second only to Kokomo in average daily price changes this year.Analysts say a major upgrade underway at BPs enormous Whiting Refinery in Northwest Indiana that processes 413,000 barrels of oil per day and serves much of the region is partly to blame. Construction has kept output lower, especially during the first half of 2013.When output at a local refinery falls, fuel terminals must be filled with gasoline from refineries further away. That raises shipping costs, and it lowers supplies throughout the region.California was a trouble spot in 2012. Prices spiked there last fall to a record $4.67 per gallon after an Exxon refinery in Southern California briefly lost power at a time when a Chevron refinery in Richmond, Calif. was operating at a lower rate following a fire.Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy policy expert at the University of California, Davis, suggests that refiners should be required by regulators to keep a minimum level of refined fuel in inventory, as is done in Europe, to help protect against sharp price spikes.That might help people like Mike Barnett, who spends about $250 a day on fuel for his small business in Kokomo installing underground lines for telecom companies. He puts just a quarter or half a tank of gas in his vans and trucks when the price gets high and then waits for a better deal."You just cant come and get gas like you used to," he said.	2013-11-02

(AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  U.S. home prices rose in August from a year earlier at the pace since February 2006. But the price gains slowed in many cities from July, a sign that the spike in prices over the past year may have peaked.The Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 12.8 percent over the 12 months ending in August. Thats up from 12.4 percent in July from a year earlier. All 20 cities showed year-over-year gains.ADVERTISEMENTHowever, a measure of month-over month prices for the 20 cities rose just 1.3 percent in August. Thats down from a 1.8 percent month-over-month gain in July. And 16 of the 20 cities reported more modest price increases in August than in July.Greater demand and a tighter supply of homes for sale have helped drive prices higher over the past year. But over the summer, mortgage rates jumped from their record lows. And weaker job growth is also discouraging potential home buyers.Prices in Las Vegas rose 29.2 percent from a year earlier, the fastest pace in the nation. But they are still 47 percent lower than they were before the housing market collapsed.Prices in Denver and Dallas hit record levels in August. None of the other cities have returned to where they were before the real estate collapse. Average home prices are only back to mid-2004 levels and 22 percent below their April 2006 peak.And many of the cities are seeing their gains slow.Prices in San Francisco increased 0.9 percent in August, down from a 2.2 percent monthly increase in July.Despite rising for 26 straight months, prices in Detroit are still lower than they were in January 2000.Ellen Haberle, an economist with the national real estate brokerage Redfin, said that prices have been driven higher by a limited supply of houses on the market. She expects home sales to fall in September and October partly because the federal government shutdown likely scared off potential home buyers.Contingent Macro Advisors economists Maninder Sibia and Steven Wood said housing inventory was only 83 percent of normal levels. They expect the supply to increase as rising prices encourage home owners to put their houses on the market.The Case-Shiller 20-city index covers roughly half of U.S. homes. It measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The August figures are the latest available. They are not adjusted for seasonal variations, so the monthly gains reflect more buying activity over the summer.	2013-10-29

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  U.S. businesses increased their stockpiles in September by the largest amount in eight months while sales posted a modest gain.Business inventories rose 0.6 percent in September compared with August, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. Sales rose 0.2 percent.ADVERTISEMENTA big jump in restocking helped drive faster economic growth from July through September. But there is concern that a pullback in inventory rebuilding will dampen growth in the current quarter. Rising stockpiles boost growth because they mean more factory production.The September rise in inventories was the largest since a 1 percent increase in January. It pushed total inventories to $1.68 trillion, up 3.1 percent from a year ago.Inventories had increased 0.4 percent in August, while sales were up 0.3 percent that month.The rise in September inventories was led by a 0.9 percent increase in stockpiles held by retailers. Inventories held by manufacturers and wholesalers both increased 0.4 percent.The strength in sales in September came from a 0.6 percent rise in sales at the wholesale level.The overall economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, faster than a 2.5 percent growth rate in the April-June period. And 0.8 percentage point of that gain came from growth in stockpiles.But the gains may not last. Consumers and businesses have been spending at a cautious pace. If that continues, companies will not need to keep building stockpiles at the same rapid pace as they did in the third quarter.That prospect of a slowdown in stockpiling is a key reason many of them have said they expect the economy to slow to an annual growth rate below 2 percent in the final three months of the year.But in an encouraging sign for demand, the government reported Wednesday that retail sales rose 0.4 percent in October after sales had been flat in September. Because of that strength, some economists said they may boost their forecast for growth in the fourth quarter.	2013-11-20

How much time Americans spend watching TV, getting exercise, cleaning and playing sports depends on whether they are men or women, 15 or 64, married or single. While the economy and technology have changed dramatically in the past decade, how Americans spend their time on average has remained largely unchanged.The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has released its 2012 American Time Use Survey. The survey measures the average amount of time Americans spend on different activities in a given day. Personal care, which is mostly taken up by sleep, accounts for the most amount of time each day, followed by leisure activities, including watching TV and playing sports, and work.ADVERTISEMENTClick here to see what Americans do when they are not at work.Men allocate their time differently than women. On an average day, men spent one hour and 17 minutes on household activities, which include housework, food preparation and lawn care. Meanwhile, women spent two hours and 10 minutes on those activities. Men also spent 36 minutes on a given day purchasing goods or services, while women spent about 50 minutes. Women spent just over 14 minutes a day on recreation, sports and exercise, compared to 24.6 minutes for men. In most of these cases, the difference was primarily because one sex participated more in a given activity.Time was allocated differently based on age as well. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of the time devoted to educational activities was by Americans between the ages of 15 and 24. People over the age of 75 spent more than an hour and a half eating and drinking, while people between the ages of 15 and 24 spent just an hour on that activity. While Americans over the age of 75 spent two hours and 25 minutes on household activities, people between 15 and 19 spent just 40 minutes on them.Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ annual American Time Use Survey, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the ways the average person 15 and older spends an average day each week. Weekends are factored into the calculation as well. We also reviewed numbers from the survey by gender, age and those who reported engaging in the activity in a given day.This is how Americans spend their time when not at work.8. Organizational, Civic and Religious Activities\n> Average time spent: 0.32 hours\n> Pct. Americans engage on a given day: 13.8%Americans spent an average of 19.2 minutes participating in organizational, civic and religious activities on a given day. However, only 13.8% of people engaged in these activities on an average day, and those people spent an average of two hours and 20 minutes participating. This is despite the fact that 79% of Americans are affiliated with a religious group of some sort, according to Pew Research Centers. In addition, the BLS noted that 26.5% of people engaged in volunteering activities between September 2011 and September 2012.Also Read: The Most Competitive Cities of the Future7. Educational Activities\n> Average time spent: 0.5 hours\n> Pct. Americans engage on a given day: 8.5%Younger people accounted for the vast majority of time devoted to educational activities. The average person between 15 and 24 spent far more time than anyone else on these activities, with the majority of that time spent during the weekday. Those taking part on any given day spent an average of five hours and 52 minutes doing so. People who actually attended class spent five hours and 10 minutes there, while people who reported doing research and homework spent on average two hours and 45 minutes on their tasks.6. Caring For and Helping Household Members\n> Average time spent: 0.51 hours\n> Pct. Americans engage on a given day: 24.5%More than 80% of the time Americans spent helping members of the household involved taking care of children. Those who cared for children — more than 20% of the adult population — spent an average of almost two hours performing that task. Nearly 25% of women cared for children during an average day, compared to just 15.6% of men. In addition, the women who engaged in this activity spent more time — two hours and eight minutes — on it than men, who spent one hour and 43 minutes caring for children.5. Purchasing Goods and Services\n> Average time spent: 0.72 hours\n> Pct. Americans engage on a given day: 41.4%The average American spent more than 43 minutes buying goods and services, with women spending considerably more time than men on this activity. The time spent purchasing goods and services actually has fallen from 48.6 minutes back in 2003. This could decrease further with the rise in e-commerce, which will reduce visits to brick-and-mortar stores. E-commerce sales alone are expected to rise 13% in 2013 to $262 billion. By 2017, e-commerce is expected to generate $370 billion in sales, or 10% of all retail purchases, up from 8% currently.Click for more from 247wallst.com.	2013-07-05
1206	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/10/30/detroit-bankruptcy-proposal-would-leave-pensioners-with-16-cents-on-dollar/	Detroit bankruptcy proposal would leave pensioners with 16 cents on the dollar	Sept. 19, 2013: Detroit resident Olivia Gillon addresses the media outside federal court in Detroit after attending a Detroit bankruptcy hearing.(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)It was the politicians, and not longtime city workers like Olivia Gillon, who brought Detroit to the brink of insolvency, but now Gillon can only watch as lawyers negotiating the Motor Citys bankruptcy bid place a new value on her hard-earned pension: 16 cents on the dollar.The beleaguered city, facing debt of as much as $20 billion and led by a state-appointed manager, tried nearly a year ago to renegotiate with creditors. When those talks broke down, the city filed for bankruptcy last July, but the filing was ruled unconstitutional by a judge. A series of state and federal rulings followed, culminating in a trial that began last week in which the city must show it is eligible to enter bankruptcy. Thats when the frightening magnitude of the "haircut" being sought for some 21,000 retirees emerged.ADVERTISEMENT“It’s wrong on every possible level,” Gillon, 68, told FoxNews.com. “I earned my pension. I retired expecting it and I feel that I should have it.”- Olivia Gillon, retired Detroit city workerThe retirees include police officers, firefighters and other municipal workers, but not teachers, who are covered by a state-administered system. The affected workers have been promised some $3.5 billion in pension payments and another $6 billion in health care benefits, money most agree the city cant pay. But for a retiree counting on a modest annual pension of, say $30,000, the proposed cut would leave him or her with $4,800. Of all the once-proud citys creditors, including banks, vendors and bondholders, retired workers are the least able to take the hit, said Gillon. “Some people are going to be hit hard,” Gillon told FoxNews.com. “I’ll have to change the way I live.”Gillon is a member of the Detroit Retired City Employees Association, which, together with the Retired Detroit Police & Fire Fighters Association, represent about 70 percent of the city’s approximately 21,000 retirees. Along with the Michigan chapter of the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, they are fighting the bid by claiming the city of Detroit has not proven it is insolvent, has not negotiated in good faith with its creditors and that the bankruptcy filing violates the state constitution protecting retirement benefits for public workers.Bob Gordon, who represents the two pension funds, argued in court last week that the city can restructure without cutting pensions, which are protected by the state in a manner that he said is “binding” and “impermeable.” The Michigan state constitution does contain a provision that bans any action that threatens to cut the pension benefits of public employees, but several experts have said the federal bankruptcy code would trump the state statute, especially if the city can demonstrate it has no way of making an estimated 100,000 creditors whole.The Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy, which sounded a warning about Detroits fiscal problems more than a decade ago, said the old-style defined benefits pensions that have long been a centerpiece of civil service leave pensioners at the mercy of politicians.“It’s just another example of the flaws of a defined pension system,” said Ted O’Neil, a Mackinac analyst. “The problem with putting trust in government to invest and save your money is that they don’t always make the best choices.“People who worked hard for their pension many end up being scapegoats,” he added.Indeed, the Mackinac 2000 study looks prophetic now: "If Detroits future expenditures were relatively stable, this financial snapshot still would be cause for concern. But the city is looking at two new outlays of monstrous proportions: funding the pension obligations of current and future city employees, which could cost up to $3 billion, and fulfilling requirements under several federal environmental acts, which will cost billions more," read the report.The 16 cents on the dollar estimate could be a message to unions, which previously refused to negotiate cuts. But now, Gillon seems resigned to the fact that her retirement will be far less comfortable than she ever thought, no matter how things shake out. Perhaps ironically, she knows shell have to conduct some negotiations with her own creditors."Hopefully, Ill be able to get some refinancing,” she said.	2013-10-30

That prompted harsh words from both the company and from Teamsters officials.ADVERTISEMENT"We deeply regret the necessity of todays decision, but we do not have the financial resources to weather an extended nationwide strike," Chief Executive Gregory Rayburn said in a statement. "Hostess Brands will move promptly to lay off most of its 18,500-member workforce and focus on selling its assets to the highest bidders."The company said it will continue to ship out its well-known products until inventory runs out.The national strike by members of the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM) that began last week decimated the 82-year-old company’s ability to produce and deliver products at roughly 12 of its 33 plants. The company announced earlier in the week that the ax would fall on Friday if the strikers didn’t get back to work, but the union didn’t blink. BCTGM President Frank Hurt said Thursday that the crisis was the "result of nearly a decade of financial and operational mismanagement" and charged management was scapegoating workers to allow the Wall Street investors who own Hostess to sell.Calls seeking comment from Hurt were not returned early Friday.Marty Zimmerman, secretary-treasurer for BCTGM Local 85, told Fox40 from a Sacramento picket line early Friday that workers had been at “wits end” with Hostess brass.“Well, the mindset is we’re standing strong, absolutely,” Zimmerman told the station. “I mean, they’ve taken our pensions away, we’ve had seven CEOs in the last 10 years; this company has been so mismanaged. Really, we’re at our wits end and enough is enough”The Irving, Texas-based company had already reached an agreement on pay and benefit cuts with its largest union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. On Thursday, Teamsters officials blasted the smaller union for not seeking a “solution” in the process or to engage in negotiations.“The BCTGM chose a different path, as is their prerogative, to not substantively look for a solution or engage in the process,” the statement read. “BCTGM members were told there were better solutions than the final offer, although Judge Drain stated in his decision in bankruptcy court that no such solutions exist. Without complete information, BCTGM members voted by voice votes in union halls. The BCTGM reported that over 90 percent rejected the final offer and three of its units ratified the final offer.”In a letter to employees posted on the company’s website, Rayburn said all employees would eventually lose their jobs, some sooner than others."Many people have worked incredibly long and hard to keep this from happening, but now Hostess Brands has no other alternative than to begin the process of winding down and preparing for the sale of our iconic brands," Rayburn’s letter read. “As you know, for many months the Company has been working with our unions, lenders and other stakeholders to reach a consensual resolution to legacy costs and labor contracts. Despite everyone’s considerable efforts to move Hostess out of its restructuring, when we began implementing the Company’s last, best and final offer, the Bakers Union chose to stage a crippling strike.”Because the company is privately held, its financials were not available. But has struggled for several years, with some blaming America’s increasing appetite for healthier fare. The company sought concessions from employees, but instead got a costly strike that further crippled it, according to officials, who told a federal bankruptcy court it would lose up to $9.5 million from Nov. 9 to Nov. 19 in lost sales and increased costs. The company has cancelled all orders in process and said any baked goods currently in transit would be returned to shippers.“These losses and other factors, including increased vendor payment terms contraction, have resulted in a significant weakening of the debtors’ cash position and, if continued, would soon result in the debtors completely running out of cash,” the filing read.Hostess will now sell its popular brands like Ding Dongs, Ho Ho’s and Sno Balls, along with the closure of 565 distribution centers, 570 bakery outlet stores and roughly 5,550 delivery routes.Lenders have agreed to allow Hostess to continue to access $75 million in financing put in place at the start of the bankruptcy cases to fund the sale and wind-down process, subject to U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval.BCTGM workers began striking at some Hostess production facilities without notifying Teamsters officials on Nov. 9, the Teamsters said.“This unannounced action put Teamster members in the difficult position of facing picket lines without knowing their right to honor such a line without being disciplined,” the statement continued.	2012-11-16

Economic output has rebounded. And the Dow Jones industrial average is in record territory.ADVERTISEMENTSo is the economy back to full health? Not quite.Not with unemployment at 7.7 percent and with 3 million fewer jobs than when the recession began. And while the housing market is improving, that engine of economic growth and job creation still has far to go before it can be declared healthy.Perhaps the best way to think about the U.S. economy is this: After five painful years, its nearly back to where it started when the recession began. Whats different now is that the trends are much healthier. Gone are the fears that the economy could fall into another recession."Weve made a lot of progress," says Michael Gapen, senior U.S. economist at Barclays Capital.The recession officially began in December 2007. It ended in June 2009. Heres a look at ways in which the economy has returned to pre-recession levels and ways it hasnt:WHATS BACK:— HOUSEHOLD WEALTH: Americans lost $16 trillion in wealth during the recession, mainly because home values and stock prices sank. Those losses have now been reversed. Household "net worth" reached $66.1 trillion in the final three months of 2012, according to the Federal Reserve. That was just 2 percent below the peak reached in the fall of 2007. And steady increases in stock prices and home values so far this year have allowed Americans as a whole to regain all their lost wealth, though many individual families have yet to recover. Increased net worth is vital to the economy because it typically drives more spending. Net worth equals the value of homes, investments, bank accounts and other assets, minus debts such as mortgages, student loans and credit card balances.— RETAIL SALES. Just as household wealth has recovered, so has consumers willingness to spend more to shop, eat out or go on vacation. That trend has spurred job growth at retailers and restaurants. Retail sales totaled $421.4 billion in February. Adjusted for inflation, that was nearly 18 percent above the recession low and just 0.7 percent below the record level in November 2007.— LAYOFFS. The job market remains weak by some measures. But consider this: If you have a job, youre less likely to lose it than at any other point in at least 12 years. That marks a sharp turnaround from the depths of the recession, when layoffs soared — from 1.8 million in December 2007 to 2.6 million in January 2009. In January this year, employers cut 1.5 million jobs — the lowest monthly total in the 12 years the government has tracked such data. That explains why the number of people seeking first-time unemployment benefits each week has plummeted. That number reached 667,000 one week in March 2009, the most in nearly 25 years. Last month, weekly applications averaged 343,000, about the same as in November 2007, just before the recession began.— FORECLOSURES. Among the most visible signs of the recession were the "Foreclosure" and "Bank Owned" signs that dotted housing developments around the country. But home prices have been rising steadily. Foreclosures have sunk back to pre-recession levels. Banks repossessed 45,000 homes in February 2013, according to RealtyTrac, a foreclosure listing firm. That was the fewest since September 2007 and was down from a peak of 102,000 in March 2010.— STOCK MARKET. Last month, the stock market finally regained the painful losses investors suffered during the recession. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at an all-time high of 14,253.77 on March 6. That topped its previous peak of 14,164.53 in October 2007. The Dow had plunged all the way to 6,547.05 in March 2009. It closed even higher on Tuesday at 14,662. 01. And the Standard & Poors 500 stock index, a broader measure of the market, reached a record 1,570.25.— GDP. Americas economy is producing more goods and services than before the recession began. In the final three months of 2007, it produced an annual rate of $13.3 trillion in goods and services, a record high. That figure had shrunk to $12.7 trillion when the recession ended. It then began to recover. The U.S. gross domestic product, the broadest gauge of production, regained its previous peak by the end of 2011. And in the final three months of 2012, GDP was $13.7 trillion. Still, that gain comes with an asterisk, because the population has grown. Viewed on a per capita basis, GDP at the end of 2012 remained 1.5 percent below its pre-recession peak.WHATS NOT BACK:— TOTAL JOBS. The United States still has many fewer jobs than in December 2007. The recession eliminated 8.7 million. Since then, 5.7 million jobs have come back, leaving the economy 3 million short. And the population of Americans 16 and older has grown by 13 million since then. As a result, a much smaller proportion of people are either working or looking for work than before the recession. The labor force participation rate — the percentage of adults with a job or seeking one — has sunk from its pre-recession level of 66 percent to 63.5 percent in February. That matches a 30-year low.— UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. When the recession began, unemployment was 5 percent. Now, its 7.7 percent. Probably no figure better illustrates the downturns lingering damage. The unemployment rate is well below the recessions peak of 10 percent in October 2009 but far above the 5 percent to 6 percent range associated with a healthy economy. Twelve million people are unemployed. Yet that figure doesnt include 2.6 million people without jobs who have stopped looking for one. An additional 8 million work part time but want full-time work. Combining all those groups, 22.6 million people are either unemployed or "underemployed." They represent an underemployment rate of 14.3 percent, down from a peak of 17.1 percent in April 2010.— HOUSING. The housing market has been recovering for about a year but still hasnt reached normal levels. Previously occupied homes were sold in February at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 4.98 million. An annual rate of about 5.5 million would be healthy. In the recession, sales had bottomed at 3.8 million. And last month, builders began work on a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 917,000 homes. Thats way up from a recession low of 478,000. But its still far from a healthy annual rate of roughly 1.5 million. Prices have risen nearly 9 percent since bottoming in March 2012, according to the Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller index, but they remain 29 percent below their pre-recession peak. Still, housing differs from other sectors: Its peaks occurred during a housing bubble that eventually burst. Few expect or even want prices to return to those levels soon. Most economists welcome the steady but modest growth housing has achieved in recent months.— AUTO SALES. Auto sales have nearly returned to where they were. Americans bought cars at an annual rate of nearly 16 million in December 2007. Sales plunged to 10.4 million in 2009. In March this year, the annual sales pace was 15.3 million. The rebound has stimulated hiring and restored the once-bankrupt General Motors and Chrysler to health.— INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT. U.S. factories arent back to their pre-recession peak of output. But theyre getting closer. Production was about 5 percent lower in February than in December 2007, according to the Federal Reserve. The Fed also tracks industrial output, a broader measure that includes mining and utilities. That figure is just 1.8 percent below its pre-recession peak.	2013-04-04

It reports figures for overall hiring, as well as the number of quits and layoffs. The monthly jobs figures are a net total of job gains or losses.Some details of the report werent as encouraging. Employers have been slow to fill their open jobs, which suggests they are having trouble finding workers with the right skills.Total hiring actually slipped in May, to 4.72 million from 4.77 million in the previous month.But the number of people quitting their jobs rose 60,000 to 2.5 million, the highest level since June 2008. More quits indicate workers are confident about their job prospects.Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has said she is tracking the overall hiring and quits figures as indicators of the job markets health and dynamism.Both quits and hiring remain below their pre-recession levels, evidence that the job market isnt yet back to full health.In the past year, job openings have increased nearly 20 percent. But total hiring has risen just 4 percent.Some economists say that is a sign that many of those out of work dont have the skills needed for the available jobs. Former construction workers or factory employees, for example, may not be able to fill new jobs in health care or other growing fields.Others argue that companies will have to offer higher pay to attract the workers they need. That could boost overall wages, which have barely kept up with inflation since the recession ended five years ago.There are other signs pay could rise soon. There are now 2.1 unemployed workers, on average, for every job opening. That is the ratio that typically exists in a healthy economy and indicates employers may have to try harder to fill jobs, perhaps by boosting salaries."We think the result is going to be a pickup in wage growth," said Cooper Howes, U.S. economist at Barclays Capital.	2014-07-08

Total business sales rose 0.6 percent in July, up from just 0.2 percent in June.ADVERTISEMENTRising stockpiles can be a good sign for the economy because they suggest companies expect greater sales. Greater inventory building also means businesses likely ordered more goods, boosting factory production and economic growth. And higher sales mean that companies are less likely to be stuck with excess goods.Business stockpiles in July stood at a seasonally adjusted $1.66 trillion, 3.2 percent higher than a year ago.	2013-09-13

Payroll processor ADP issues its report Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2013, on job growth among private companies in November. (AP Photo/David Goldman, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  A private survey shows U.S. businesses last month added the most jobs in a year, powered by big gains in manufacturing and construction.Payroll processor ADP said Wednesday that companies and small businesses added 215,000 jobs in November. And ADP said private employers added 184,000 jobs in October, much stronger than its initial estimate of 130,000.ADVERTISEMENTThe ADP numbers cover only private businesses and often diverge from the governments more comprehensive report. Last month, the Labor Department said private businesses added 212,000 jobs in October. The Labor Department will report on November job growth Friday.Still, the figure suggests that hiring remained healthy in November after picking up in the prior three months. Manufacturing and construction firms each added 18,000 jobs. That was the biggest gain for manufacturers since early this year.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodys Analytics, said the figures show that employers shook off the partial government shutdown in October and kept hiring, despite a drop in consumer confidence. Moodys helps compile the ADP data."Thats very encouraging as we make our way into next year," Zandi said.Other economists also said the hiring boost was a good sign, but noted that the ADP figures are not always a reliable guide to the governments figure."Take this with a grain of salt, but if the direction is right, it is good news," said Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets.Employers of all sizes added jobs, the report found. And services firms added 176,000 jobs, the most in a year.The government says public and private employers have added an average of 202,000 jobs a month from August through October. That was up from an average of 146,000 from May through June.At the same time, growth picked up. The economy expanded at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter. But analysts expect growth to slow in the current quarter to about a 2 percent rate.	2013-12-04

One caught fire at Bostons Logan airport.The planes were cleared to resume flying in April after Boeing redesigned the battery system and got approval for the changes from global aviation regulators. Ethiopian was the first airline to resume using the 787.Boeing shares fell $5.60, or 5.3 percent, to $101.25 in afternoon trading. The shares earlier dropped as low as $98.99.Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said in an email to The Associated Press that the company has personnel looking into the event at Heathrow.Shares of Boeing suppliers also fell. Precision Castparts fell $3.49, or 1.5 percent, to $233.78. Spirit Aerosystems, which also makes parts for the 787, fell 48 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $22.65.Citi analyst Jason Gursky said the cause of the fire may not be known until later Friday or over the weekend. So, the ultimate outcome for Boeings stock might wait until Monday. He said a fire related to the planes electrical system, even if it is not tied to the lithium-ion battery, would be a concern for investors."If the fire is related to a burned coffee pot or a mistake in the crew rest area.the stock should recover quickly to $106-$107," Gursky wrote in a note to clients.	2013-07-12

Airlines, hotels and campgrounds are expecting to see more customers in 2013 than in the previous few summers. (AP Photo/Mike Groll, File)The Associated PressNEW YORK –  This summer, high rollers are flying to lavish vacation hot spots for their vacations. The rest of us are headed to places like nearby campgrounds.The good news: At some U.S. campgrounds these days you get live bands, air guitar contests and chocolate pudding slip n slides.ADVERTISEMENTAmericans plans for summer travel mirror the current state of the economy. Rising home prices and a soaring stock market are encouraging those at the top of the income ladder to take more extravagant trips. But large segments of the population are staying close to home because wages are stagnant, rents are high and the end of the payroll tax holiday has shrunk their take-home pay.For a travel industry still stinging from the Great Recession, that likely means another summer of steady, but slow, recovery.AAA, one of the nations largest leisure travel agencies, isnt expecting a resounding start to vacation season this Memorial Day. Citing the "up and down economy," AAA expects 31.2 million Americans to hit the road this weekend, virtually the same number as last year. Throw in planes, trains and buses, and the number of travelers will drop about 1 percent, AAA says.As vacationers set out this summer, heres what they can expect:— Gas prices about the same as last year. The national average price of gasoline was $3.65 a gallon Friday, 1 cent higher than during last years Memorial Day weekend. Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at GasBuddy.com, expects prices to drift lower after the holiday and fall close to last summers low of $3.33 per gallon before hurricane season starts to drag them up again.— More expensive hotel rooms. The average hotel will cost $112.21, before taxes and any other add-on such as resort fees. Thats up 4.4 percent from last years $107.52, according to hotel research firm STR. Hotels are also expected to be slightly fuller, with occupancy rates climbing from 69.3 percent last summer to 70 percent this year.— Packed planes, steady airfare. Airlines for America, the industrys lobby group, expects 208.7 million people to fly, up 1 percent from last year. About 87 percent of airplane seats will be filled with paying passengers. Domestic fliers will pay $421 on average for a round trip ticket, down $6 from last summer. International fliers will pay $1,087, up $8, according to the Airlines Reporting Corp.— Amtrak expects to meet or exceed the 8.3 million passengers it carried last summer. But the taxpayer-backed railroad wouldnt disclose how fares compare with last summers average one-way ticket of $66.39.Mike Klopp, a commercial insurance salesman in Irvine, Calif., is starting to feel better about the economy. He and his wife plan to take their three kids on a vacation up the coast to Monterey in August — a trip they skipped last year.But Klopp says local trips are the limit because theyre cheaper. Like many others, hes not yet willing to splurge on a dream vacation."The kids would love to go to Hawaii, but theres no way Im going to do that. Weve been hunkering down, money is tight right now," he says."Im not sold that things are better," he says.Other Americans likely agree. Although the unemployment rate has dropped to 7.5 percent, compared with a post-recession high of 10 percent, the Federal Reserve doesnt see it falling below 7.3 percent this year. And economic growth still isnt as strong as it has been after previous recessions. The economy grew at an annual pace of 2.5 percent from January to March. Economists expect the rate to slow to 2 percent from April through June, partly because of the federal budget cuts that started taking effect March 1.Those with higher incomes never stopped traveling, but thanks to new highs in the stock market they now feel secure enough to take longer vacations.Patrick Veling, the owner of a California real estate data analysis and consulting business, says hes taking his "most expensive vacation ever" this year. Instead of the normal one-week vacation, he and his wife Susan are taking their two adult kids on a three-week vacation through northern Europe that will include a 12-day cruise. Theyll see Denmark, Norway, the Shetland Islands, Ireland and the Netherlands."My confidence in the economy and my business is now strong enough that my wife and I have pretty much insisted we make this trip," says Veling.Others are benefiting from rising home prices and low interest rates. Their homes are finally worth more than they owe on their mortgage, and they are finding it easier to refinance. That leaves them more money to spend."The improvement in confidence is all in the upper income brackets," says Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial.During the worst days of the recession, travelers mostly stayed home. Hotels desperate to fill rooms started marketing "staycations" to families who couldnt afford to drive or fly somewhere. Summer air travel fell by nearly 8 percent in two years, from 217.6 million passengers in 2007 to 200.3 million in 2009. Luxury hotels saw their occupancy levels plummet during that period from 72.5 percent to 59.3 percent. More than half the rooms at economy and midscale hotels sat vacant.There has been a slow and steady climb back, but not all parts of the recovery have been equal.Luxury hotels such as Four Seasons, Park Hyatt, Ritz-Carlton and Mandarin Oriental are filling 73 percent of their rooms on average, surpassing their pre-recession peak, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from hotel research firm STR.But budget hotels like Days Inn, Econo Lodge and Motel 6 are still below their 10-year occupancy average and more than 3 percentage points below their peak.The same pattern holds for fliers.Domestic traffic is projected to grow 0.7 percent this summer, while the number of people buying more expensive international tickets will climb 2.6 percent, according to Airlines for America."Expect luxury travel to continue to rebound — consistent with luxury across all industries — while the rest of summer travel will be flat" as the economy still weighs heavily on middle-income families, says Adam Weissenberg, who heads the travel and hospitality consulting group at Deloitte.But some less-expensive destinations are seeing a recovery.Campgrounds fared well during the downturn because they are relatively affordable. Some are now doing better business than ever because the operators have retooled their facilities to entice visitors beyond the typical outdoor types.Steve Stafford, general manager of North Texas Jellystone Park Camp-Resort in Burleson, Texas, has attracted a broader swath of people with "homesteads." These are recreational vehicles that look like cottages. Now the camp can accommodate campers with tents who only have to pay $32 a night for an empty patch of ground and those who want to stay in the comfort of the largest homesteads for $209 a night.The 37 existing homesteads were booked solid last year. So Stafford is adding a dozen new ones. Those are already booked, even though they are still being installed.In recent years, the campground has added activities such as arts and crafts, live bands, laser tag, outdoor big-screen movies and theme weekends to try to lure people back. On the schedule for Memorial Day weekend: A chocolate pudding slip n slide.The moves appear to be working."The way its looking so far, we are going to be way up," Stafford says. "No matter how bad things get, people are going to take a vacation."The hunt for inexpensive vacations is helping companies that recreational vehicles, too. Traveling by RV means families dont need to pay for hotels and can cook most of their meals. Families may not be ready to buy one — sales are only up slightly — but more are choosing to rent one this summer for as little as $100 a day, or $300 during peak weeks.At El Monte RV, one of the countrys largest RV rental companies, summer bookings from domestic customers are up 20 to 25 percent compared with last year."It has stunned us," says marketing director Joe Laing. "Were looking forward to this year. We think its going to be a good one."Businessmen and state officials on the Gulf Coast of Florida, Alabama and Mississippi are also hoping for a good summer. The tourism industry there was devastated by the BP oil spill of 2010. As part of a settlement, BP has been financing large advertising campaigns to get tourists back to the region."This is going to be the best summer season weve ever had," predicts Tish Williams, executive director of the Hancock County Chamber of Commerce in Mississippi.Williams has spent $962,000 in BP grants to market her county and a new science center there to tourists in northern Mississippi and neighboring Louisiana.In Florida, the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau says lodging tax revenue is up 7.5 percent this year. The tourism industry has spent BP money as far north as Chicago — a 14-hour drive away — to lure new visitors.But the most pampered vacationers this summer might not even be human.The Barkley Pet Hotel & Spa in Westlake Village, Calif., is booked solid this Memorial Day. After a recent 18,000-square-foot expansion — another doggie day camp area for small dogs, another grooming salon and spa and another wing of luxury suites — there is now room for 250 pets.This summer, they can attend ice cream socials, surf in a beach-like pool or play in the day camps, which are shaded by cabanas and cooled by misters.Some might say the pets have it better off than their traveling owners.__With reports from Melissa Nelson-Gabriel in Pensacola, Sue Manning in Los Angeles and Paul Wiseman in Washington.__Scott Mayerowitz can be reached at http://twitter.com/GlobeTrotScott .

U.S. employers advertised about the same number of jobs in November as in October, suggesting hiring will stay modest over the next few months. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  U.S. employers advertised about the same number of jobs in November as in October, suggesting hiring will stay modest over the next few months.Job openings ticked up 11,000 last month to 3.67 million, the Labor Department said Thursday. Thats about 12 percent more than were advertised in the same month a year ago.ADVERTISEMENTThe number of available jobs is slowly climbing back to the roughly 4 million that were advertised each month before the recession began in December 2007.More than 12 million people were unemployed in November. That means there were 3.3 unemployed people, on average, competing for each open job. Thats the lowest ratio since November 2008. Still, in a healthy economy, the ratio is roughly 2 to 1.Separately, the Labor Department said the number of people seeking unemployment aid slightly increased last week, ticking up 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 371,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose after falling to a four-year low the previous week.Overall, the two reports suggest that the job market is improving at the start of 2013 at roughly the same slow but steady pace as last year.Overall hiring was largely unchanged in November, according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. Companies hired 4.3 million people, just 3,000 more than in October. Layoffs ticked down to nearly 1.7 million, 10,000 below Octobers number.The number of people who quit their jobs rose, but was little changed compared to this summer. More quits can be a good sign for the job market. Most people quit when they move to another job.Job openings rose in retail and hotels and restaurants, which likely reflect holiday-related gains. Openings ticked down in construction and manufacturing.Employers added 161,000 jobs in November and 155,000 in December, according to the government employment report released Friday. The unemployment rate fell stayed at 7.8 percent in December. It fell to that level in November from 7.9 percent in October.The gain in hiring nearly matched the average of 153,000 jobs per month in 2011 and 2012. Thats been just enough to slowly push down the unemployment rate, which fell 0.7 percentage points in 2012.Thursdays JOLTS report looks at total hiring, layoffs and quits. The report released Friday measured net hiring and unemployment.The JOLTs report suggests that employers didnt step up layoffs or cut back on hiring in the midst of the debate over the tax and spending changes known as the fiscal cliff. Many economists feared that the prospect of higher taxes and steep cuts in federal spending would drag on job gains.Thats a good sign, since more budget showdowns are expected. Congress must vote to raise the governments $16.4 trillion borrowing limit by around late February. If not, the government risks defaulting on its debt. Republicans will likely demand deep spending cuts as the price of raising the debt limit.	2013-01-10

The average on the 30-year fixed mortgage fell last week to 3.40 percent. . (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  The average U.S. rate on the 15-year fixed mortgage fell to a new record low last week, and the rate on the 30-year fixed loan declined. Cheaper mortgages have encouraged more home-buying and refinancing.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate for the 15-year fixed mortgage slipped to 2.56 percent. Thats the lowest on records dating to 1991. It fell from 2.61 percent last week, the previous record.ADVERTISEMENTThe rate on the 30-year loan declined to 3.35 percent from 3.40 percent last week. Thats near the average rate of 3.31 percent reached in November, the lowest on records dating back to 1971.Low mortgage rates have helped sustain a housing recovery that began last year. Home sales and construction are up from a year ago, and prices are rising in most markets.The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes rose in March to the highest level in three years, the National Association of Realtors said earlier this week.And home prices rose 9.3 percent in February compared with a year earlier, according to the Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index. Thats the biggest annual gain in nearly seven years.Still, prices are surging because more buyers have fewer homes to bid on. And sales are rising in some markets hit hardest by the housing crisis because investors are scooping up homes before prices rise further.Mortgage rates are falling because they tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The yield fell to 1.63 percent on Thursday — the lowest this year.The yield declines when demand for Treasurys increases. The Federal Reserve has been buying Treasury bonds since the fall. And in recent weeks, concerns that economic growth is slowing in the U.S. and abroad has led investors to shift money into safer assets, like Treasurys, and away from stocks.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country on Monday through Wednesday each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for 30-year mortgages edged down to 0.7 point from 0.8 point last week. The fee for 15-year loans was unchanged at 0.7 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage fell to 2.56 percent from 2.62 percent last week. The fee for one-year adjustable-rate loans held steady at 0.3 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage declined to 2.56 percent from 2.58 percent. The fee was stable at 0.5 point.	2013-05-02

In November, Colorado voters will be asked to approve a 15 percent excise tax plus a 10 percent statewide sales tax on all retail pot purchases.Hancock said the city should have the flexibility to increase the tax to up to 10 percent.Click for more from the Denver Post.	2013-07-09

Once they fell behind a third time, it was simply too late for another chance.Trevor Crowe hit an RBI single in the bottom of the ninth inning that lifted the Astros over the Twins 6-5.ADVERTISEMENT"We kind of hung in here, kind of got back in the game, and they came up with the big one at the end, and we didnt," Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said.Jonathan Villar singled to start the ninth and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Jose Altuve. Crowes line drive to left field off Brian Duensing (6-2) allowed the speedy Villar to score easily, giving Houston its first win in six tries against Minnesota this season."I just didnt execute right there at the end, and they did what they were supposed to," Duensing said.Ryan Doumits leadoff home run in the ninth against Astros reliever Erik Bedard (4-10) tied it at 5.Minnesota was down 3-0 after a three-run first inning by the Astros before tying it on a three-run shot by Alex Presley in the third. It was Presleys first homer since being acquired from Pittsburgh in the trade for Justin Morneau.Pedro Florimon doubled to open the eighth and scored on a groundout by Darin Mastroianni as the Twins closed to 5-4.Before tying it, Minnesota squandered a chance in the seventh when Chris Herrmann grounded into an inning-ending double play with the bases loaded."We had chances, but there at the end, they just got it done," Gardenhire said.Brandon Barnes had two RBIs, and Chris Carter and Brett Wallace added two hits apiece for Houston.Minnesota starter Liam Hendriks yielded eight hits and five runs in 4 1-3 innings, leaving him with just one win in six starts this season."It was embarrassing," said Hendriks. "I got lackadaisical out there, and I just wasnt myself. I have to get back to getting ahead early, and keeping the ball down."Houston starter Jordan Lyles allowed four hits and three runs in 6 1-3 innings.An RBI double by Wallace put Houston up 1-0 in the first inning. Carter walked before Wallace barely scored on a single by Marc Krauss to make it 2-0, and Barnes added a sacrifice fly.Presley came out on top of a 13-pitch at-bat in the third, coming back from an 0-2 count before hitting a tying home run to right field."He has had some really good at-bats, in particular the one today with the three-run homer," Gardenhire said. "Presley is doing fine. We are just having fun watching these kids play."Jose Altuve doubled with two outs in the fourth and scored on Crowes single for a 4-3 lead.Carter led off the fifth with a single, then the 6-foot-4, 245-pound slugger took second on his second steal this season. Barnes single off reliever Ryan Pressly pushed Houstons lead to 5-3.NOTES: Krauss was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City on Wednesday and was Houstons designated hitter. ... The Twins are off on Thursday before opening a 10-game homestand with a three-game series against Toronto. ... The Astros open a four-game series with Oakland on Thursday when Houstons Brad Peacock opposes Sonny Gray. ...

As defaults and losses mounted in the housing market, especially among subprime loans, the value of bonds backed by the bad debt plummeted.As the mortgage market collapsed, the ratings agencies sharply lowered their ratings on the investments.With the value of such investments declining, funds that purchased the bonds filed for bankruptcy. King County and Abu Dhabi sued the ratings agencies and Morgan Stanley claiming the banks misled them about the safety of some investments that were part of a structured investment vehicle.A structured investment vehicle is a fund that borrows money by issuing short-term securities at a low interest rate and then lends that money by purchasing long-term securities at higher interest. That process can make a profit for its investors from the difference.	2013-04-27

The company had pegged its initial public offering price – in a tweet, naturally - at $26 per share, which would make the company worth about 18 billion. That figure was well above earlier estimates and driven by a deafening buzz not seen since Facebook stock hit the open market. Some investors think the sky is the limit for the latest web mega-property to go public.ADVERTISEMENT“Just as Google, Amazon and Facebook have become Internet Utilities, so too may Twitter,” Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Royal Bank of Canada’s  RBC Capital Market, wrote in an upbeat research note on Wednesday. “We think that current valuation does not fully reflect Twitter’s enormous opportunity.”- Vivek Wadhwa, Stanford UniversityIPOs are typically expected to drive stock prices higher that the initial target on the first day of trading, and the buzz surrounding Twitter prompted major oversubscription of shares. The opening price of $45.10 makes the company worth more than $30 billion. In early trading, it edged up to $48.25.But if Facebook is to be a guide, the stock story of Twitter, which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TWTR, could take some twists and turns. Facebook’s May, 2012, initial public offering raised $18.4 billion, which made it the second-biggest U.S. IPO ever behind Visa’s 2008 offering of $19.65 billion.Facebook targeted its IPO price at $38 per share, but frenzied initial trading saw it rise to $45 before closing the day just 23 cents above the target price. In subsequent weeks, it fell to as low as $20 per share, but it now hovers near the lofty $50 mark.The decision to trade on the New York Stock Exchange instead of the tech-heavy Nasdaq was seen as a coup for the older exchange. Facebooks debut on the Nasdaq was marred by computer glitches, which may have prompted Twitters decision.Some experts are urging caution, and noting that despite all the eyeballs that view Twitter, the company still loses money. The company has lost  $133.85 million through the first three-quarters of 2013, following a 2012 that saw the company $71 million in the red.“We are back at the dotcom days,” Vivek Wadhwa, a fellow at Stanford University, told Fox Business. “Twitter is a good company but nothing like these ridiculous predictions we’re hearing about… These analysts are smoking something.”But Twitter enthusiasts note the company generated $317 million in revenue in 2012, up nearly 200 percent from the year. Revenue growth is projected at 101 percent for this year, and some investors believe the company can get its margins into the black.The company is starting off with an offering of 70 million shares – considered a relatively small allotment. The sale will leave the company with more than 500 million shares of common stock.Reuters and Fox Business contributed to this report	2013-11-07

But while the NLRB considers the request, the worlds largest retailer called this years Black Friday a success even though union-backed protests broke out at some locations over worker conditions and wages. ADVERTISEMENTDave Tovar, a company spokesman, said the discounter learned from shoppers that they want to start shopping right after Thanksgiving dinner. Then they want time to sleep before they wake up and head back to the stores.The move appeared to be paying off. Walmart said in a statement Friday that stores saw larger crowds then last year. The company also downplayed the number of protests and called it a "union-funded publicity stunt.""Only 26 protests occurred at stores last night and many of them did not include any Walmart associates," the store said in a statement. It estimated that less than 50 associates participated in the protests.The exact number of associates in the protests at the stores is difficult to independently verify.A union-backed group called OUR Walmart, which is comprised of former and current workers, used Black Friday as a chance to stage demonstrations and walkouts at hundreds of stores nationwide to bring attention to what they consider unfair wages and job conditions at the world’s largest retailer.Walmart has been one of the biggest targets of protests against holiday hours. Many of the companys stores are open 24 hours, but the company was offering early bird specials that once were reserved for Black Friday at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving instead.The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which helped organize the protests, said on its website that the protests are aimed at the company’s attempts to silence workers who speak out for better jobs.Employees like Josue Mata, 28, an immigrant from Mexico who is divorced and a father of four, voiced his dissatisfaction with the new hours. He told WFAA.com, a Dallas station, that he makes $8.70 an hour cleaning floors."The holiday is time you need to spend with your family," he said, while taking part in a small protest near Fort Worth. "You have 365 other days to have a sale. Its really pointless. Its all about money."The protests appeared to be small and peaceful. One protester was arrested at a Portland, Ore., location, but police did not give further details, Oregonlive.com reported.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that about two dozen union protesters formed a picket-line near an Atlanta store and there was an encounter with an SUV driver who apparently nudged several protesters.The protesters at the Atlanta location were distributing flyers demanding an increase in pay to $13 per hour, better health care and freedom to unionize without retaliation, the report said.Some protesters at a Maryland location held signs that read No justice, no peace and Respect Our Associates. The amount of protesters who actually still work at these locations depended upon who you asked. In some cases, protest organizers said there were dozens of associates, but store managers put the number at zero.

The increase shows the housing recovery is strengthening.The Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index released Tuesday also surged 2.4 percent in May from April. The month-over-month gain nearly matched the 2.6 percent increase in April from March — the highest on record.ADVERTISEMENTThe price increases were widespread. All 20 cities showed gains in May from April and compared with a year ago.Prices in Dallas and Denver reached the highest level on records dating back to 2000. That marks the first time since the housing bust that any city has reached an all-time high.Home values are rising as more people are bidding on a scarce supply of houses for sale. Steady price increases, along with stable job gains and historically low mortgage rates, have in turn encouraged more Americans to buy homes.Higher home prices help the economy in several ways. They encourage more sellers to put their homes on the market, boosting supply and sustaining the housing recovery. And they make homeowners feel wealthier, encouraging consumers to spend more.The index covers roughly half of U.S. homes. It measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The May figures are the latest available. They are not adjusted for seasonal variations, so the monthly gains reflect more buying activity over the summer.Mortgage rates have surged since early May, though the increase would have had little impact on the current report. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has jumped a full percentage point since early May and reached a two-year high of 4.51 percent in late June.Rates jumped after Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Federal Reserve could slow its bond-buying program later this year if the economy continues to improve. The Feds bond purchases have kept long-term interest rates low, encouraging more borrowing and spending.In recent weeks, Bernanke and other Fed members have stressed that any change in the bond-buying program will depend on the economys health, not a set calendar date.Since those comments, interest rates have declined. The average on the 30-year mortgage was 4.31 percent last week.	2013-07-30

Commerce Department reports on business orders for durable goods in September Friday Oct. 25, 2013. (AP Photo/Toby Talbot)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  A jump in demand for commercial airplanes boosted orders for long-lasting U.S. factory goods last month. But orders for most other goods fell as businesses cut spending, a possible sign of concern about the partial government shutdown that began Oct. 1.The Commerce Department said Friday orders for durable goods rose 3.7 percent in September, above the 0.2 percent gain in August. But a 57.5 percent jump in aircraft orders accounted for nearly all the gain. Durable goods are meant to last at least three years.ADVERTISEMENTOrders for core capital goods, which include industrial machinery and electrical equipment, fell 1.1 percent. Augusts 1.5 percent gain was revised sharply lower to 0.4 percent. Economists pay particular attention to core capital goods, which exclude aircraft, because they are a sign of business confidence.The figures echo other economic data that suggest companies were reluctant to expand or invest in new equipment or hiring in September. Hiring also slowed last month.Commercial aircraft is a volatile category that can swing widely from month to month. Boeing says it received orders for 127 planes in September, up from just 16 in August.In September, demand fell for machinery, fabricated metals, electrical equipment and autos. Orders rose for computers and communications equipment and defense-related goods.Excluding aircraft, autos and other transportation goods, orders fell for the third straight month.The report contrasts with other recent data that pointed to a healthier factory sector.The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group, said factory activity expanded in September at the fastest pace in 2 ½ years. Production rose and manufacturers stepped up hiring, while new orders jumped, though not as quickly as the previous month.And the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said last week that an index of regional manufacturing activity declined only slightly this month.

But the extra pennies shell earn in 2013 will add up over the coming weeks and months.ADVERTISEMENT"Its not much, but its something," said Olson, 16, who works at Wagners European Bakery and Cafe in Olympia. "Every bit helps."Many workers around the country wont be as lucky as the ones in Washington state, which is raising its salary minimum even though it already has the highest state baseline in the country.Workers one state over -- in Idaho -- will make nearly $2 per hour less in 2013.Automatic minimum wage increases designed to compensate for inflation have steadily pushed up salaries in some states, even through the recession, expanding the pay gap between areas that make annual adjustments and those that dont. Of the 10 states that will increase the minimum wage Tuesday, nine did so automatically to adjust for inflation.Rhode Island lawmakers approved that states wage increase this past year.Paul Sonn, legal co-director at the National Employment Law Project, said he hopes more states will start looking at automatic adjustments as the economy recovers. He said the model -- which Washington state first adopted in 1998 -- helps avoid sudden jolts as states try to catch up to their peers."We think theres a case that its better for everyone, including the business community, to have predictable, regular, small increases every year," Sonn said.The automatic adjustments arent much. Washingtons bump of 15 cents will mean those who work 40-hour weeks will earn an extra $6 per week -- enough for a couple lattes -- or about $300 per year.Hundreds of thousands of workers are expected to get a pay increase with the wage adjustments that begin New Years Day. Along with Washington and Rhode Island, the changes will also occur in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, and Vermont.Between the nine states with automatic adjustments happening this year, the average minimum wage is $8.12 per hour, up from a little under $8. States that do not have automatic changes operate with an average minimum wage of about $7.40 -- a difference of about $1,500 per year for a full-time worker.Many states, including Idaho, follow the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, either because theyve tied their minimum wage to that threshold or because the state-enacted minimum is lower than that.San Francisco has set the highest local minimum wage and will have workers paid at least $10.55 an hour in 2013.Groups like the National Restaurant Association oppose further increases in federal or state minimum wages, arguing that its an ineffective way to reduce poverty and forces business owners to cut hours, raise prices or lay off workers.At Toms 1st Avenue Bento, a downtown Portland lunch spot, owner Tom Hume said he boosted pay for minimum-wage workers before the end of the year in order to get ahead of the game. He also raised prices on one-third of his menu items by 25 cents.Natasha Baker, 22, who works at Humes restaurant, recently moved back in with her mother but hopes to move to another apartment in January. She said the extra $5 or $6 shes earning every week with the salary boost is OK but wont make a huge difference."I dont usually look at what I get paid," she said. "Im more directed on whats being taken out, which is more discouraging than anything."  	2013-01-01

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File)The Associated PressWASHINGTON –  U.S. service sector firms grew in November at the weakest pace since June, evidence that cautious spending by consumers and businesses may be slowing growth.The Institute for Supply Management says its service-sector index fell to 53.9 in November, from 55.4 in October. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion. The index hit an eight-year high of 58.6 in August.ADVERTISEMENTA measure of sales fell sharply last month, a sign that consumers were reluctant to spend. And a gauge of hiring fell to the lowest level since May. That suggests job gains could slow when the government reports last months hiring figures on Friday.	2013-12-04

The Feds latest forecasts for stronger economic growth next year and slightly lower unemployment assume that happens.ADVERTISEMENTStill, Bernanke said the uncertainty surrounding the resolution is already affecting consumer and business confidence.

Thats more than Novembers total of 148,000, which was revised higher.ADVERTISEMENTThe survey showed companies added 39,000 construction jobs last month. That was partly in response to the storm but also an indication of the housing recovery under way.The increase in hiring took place before Congress and President Barack Obama reached a deal to avoid sharp tax increases from hitting most Americans, a sign that uncertainty surrounding the fiscal cliff did little to slow the job market."The job market held firm in December despite the intensifying fiscal cliff negotiations," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodys Analytics, which is working with ADP to create the employment report. "Businesses even became somewhat more aggressive in their hiring at year end."The ADP survey covers hiring only in the private sector. ADPs figures have diverged at times from the governments more comprehensive jobs report, which will be released Friday. Most economists predict that report will show employers added roughly 150,000 jobs last month.Even with the strong month of job growth, the ADP survey offered a reminder of a key area of the economy remains weak: Manufacturers cut 11,000 jobs.And Congress approved a budget deal this week that delayed crucial decisions about spending cuts for another two months. That assures more confrontation and uncertainty, especially because Congress must reach agreement later this winter to raise the governments debt limit.	2013-01-03

(Courtesy: Drakes Bay Oyster Company)A California family that has operated an oyster farm on the bucolic Northern California coast is fighting back after the federal government moved to kick it off of the National Park Service property where the shellfish have been legally harvested for nearly 80 years.The Drakes Bay Oyster Company faces closure and its 30 employees will be out of work if the National Park Service reclaims some 1,100 acres of an estuary as part of a plan to create a larger marine wilderness preserve at Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County. Owner Kevin Lunny said federal officials told him on Thursday — one day before his companys 40-year lease was set to expire — that he had three months to clear out. On Tuesday, he announced hes suing.ADVERTISEMENT"Were not going to walk away," Lunny told reporters during a conference call. "Were fighting for our community."Lunny said the company currently has roughly 10 million immature oysters worth up to $5 million awaiting harvest.Lunny has an ally in Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who had tried to get the lease extended for another decade. But even her clout failed to sway U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar.“I am extremely disappointed that Secretary Salazar chose not to renew the operating permit for the Drakes Bay Oyster Company,” Feinstein said in a statement. “The National Park Service’s review process has been flawed from the beginning with false and misleading science, which was also used in the Environmental Impact Statement. The secretary’s decision effectively puts this historic California oyster farm out of business. As a result, the farm will be forced to cease operations and 30 Californians will lose their jobs.”The National Park Service bought the land from Lunnys predecessor in 1972, but granted then-owner Johnson Oyster Company a 40-year lease to continue harvesting oysters. Salazar said in a department memo that it was made clear at the time of the leases signing that it would not be renewed, and that the information was conveyed to Lunny in 2004 when he bought the business.Salazars move will effectively end the company’s operations within the national park estuary, which includes an onshore oyster processing plant and offshore oyster harvesting on more than 1,000 acres of coastal waters.- Statement on DrakesBayOyster.com“I’ve taken this matter very seriously,” Salazar said in a statement. “We’ve undertaken a robust public process to review the matter from all sides, and I have personally visited the park to meet with the company and members of the community … I believe it is the right decision for Point Reyes National Seashore and for future generations who will enjoy this treasured landscape.”Amber Abbasi, an attorney for Cause of Action, which is representing Lunney, said the federal government did not comply with the National Environmental Policy Act and violated the Data Quality Act when determining to deny the renewal. National Park Service employees also provided false and misleading information, she said."A permit could have been granted and it was not granted," Abbasi told reporters Tuesday. "And the process by which it was not granted was deficient in many, many respects.”A motion seeking a preliminary injunction in the case will be filed later this week, she said.The estuary, according to federal officials, supports one of the largest harbor seal colonies in the state and is within the Point Reyes National Seashore, which attracts more than 2 million visitors annually and provides $85 million in economic activity to the region. Salazar said the displaced workers will get federal job training to find new work.Salazar also moved to convert the entire area to a federally-protected marine wilderness once the oyster operation has shuttered. The move follows through on a 1976 congressional designation of the expansive estuary locally known as the Estero as a potential marine wilderness area, the only such area on the West Coast of the continental United States.“Carrying out steps set in motion by the United States Congress over three decades ago, we are taking the final step to recognize this pristine area as wilderness,” said Salazar. “The Estero is one of our nation’s crown jewels, and today we are fulfilling the vision to protect this special place for generations to come.”But critics say responsible oyster harvesting poses no threat to the environment, and accuse Salazar of gunning for the commercial fishing industry.“At a time when we are struggling to solve our national fiscal problems, throwing 30 more Americans out of work and removing an estimated 40 percent of Californias oyster production — which will undoubtedly be replaced by imported oysters — makes no sense,” Rod Moore of the West Coast Seafood Processors Association told FoxNews.com in a statement.Moore said the National Park Service has a long-standing policy of trying to remove commercial fisheries from within existing or expanded national park boundaries, even while allowing other commercial concessionaires to continue. The service has made similar moves regarding federal parkland in Alaska’s Glacier Bay National Park and Everglades National Park in Florida, he said.Greenpeace Ocean Campaign Director John Hocevar said reclaiming the oyster farm and designating the wider area for federal protection preserves it for both tourism and environmental safety.“Protecting the estuary at Point Reyes National Seashore will pay dividends for the health of the areas economy as well as its ecosystem,” Hocevar wrote FoxNews.com in a statement. “Estuaries are vital nurseries for fish, crab, and other marine life. Over 2 million people visit Point Reyes each year, injecting $85 million into the local economy. Protecting coastal habitat is good business."But Lunny, whose lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Monday, said peoples livelihoods are being thrown away for no good reason.“It’s actually hard to believe this decision was made," Lunny said. "The Bay Area was ignored in this decision apparently and this is a public resource … Our family is just the current steward of this farm, it has existed for decades.”	2012-12-10

The tax has risen back up to 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent, costing someone making $50,000 annually about $1,000 per year and a household with two high-paid workers up to $4,500.ADVERTISEMENT“As a newly-graduated person, someone coming straight out of college, I don’t like the idea of having less money coming to me due to the selfish interests of people in Congress who don’t have any interest in reducing our financial problems,” Hoffman told FoxNews.com. “This is an impediment for future economic growth. It’s going to make it harder for young people like myself to get married, find a better job, you name it.”Hoffman admits the hike won’t completely alter her spending, but the University of California-San Diego graduate said she will definitely have it in mind when it comes to leisure activities and entertainment.“Although it’s a small quantity on a monthly basis, just having less money going into my paycheck will prevent me from doing things and force me to be more frugal,” she said. “I’ll be more cautious with my spending.”- Gabriella HoffmanThe looming hit to Americans’ paychecks has been a hot topic around water coolers nationwide, as well as online, where several forums have been created for taxpayers to commiserate with their lighter wallets. On Twitter, #WhyIsMyPaycheckLessThisWeek has been a trending topic as most U.S. workers have either already seen less green or are preparing to do so.“Well, looks like were starting to pay back all of the money weve spent, without cutting back spending,” one posting read.Another user cited the need for the U.S. government to “refill the Social Security ‘lockbox’” before stealing from it again as the reason paychecks are smaller.Other postings chose to politicize the end of the tax cut that was part of the fiscal pact passed by Congress last week.“Seems to me that anybody who is paid a check for working is considered ‘the rich’ in Obamas world,” Jeff Hobbs of Texas wrote Wednesday.Another posting read: “Hey Liberals, #YourPaycheckIsLowerThisWeek because you voted for the job KILLER, not the job SAVER!”So, what exactly does $40 mean?  That’s what the White House asked Americans last year when President Obama signed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, which extended the payroll tax cut and emergency jobless benefits through the end of the year and prevented the typical family earning $50,000 a year from losing roughly $40 from each paycheck.“$40 is 10 gallons of heating oil when the temperatures in winter hover in the negative numbers for months,” Pamela from Fairbanks, Alaska, posted on www.whitehouse.gov/40dollars.“Forty dollars is a tank of gas, a nicer Sunday family meal instead of hot dogs, the ability to leave lights on instead of turning them off earlier in the evening,” Rita from New Britain, Conn., wrote. “Forty dollars is being able to go to the movies, or having a night out at an inexpensive restaurant, its also paying co-pays for my meds that I need to live on.”Priscilla of Kailua, Hawaii, said $40 is the amount “sometimes between paying the electric” bill or not.“We cannot pay more,” she wrote. “We do not have it.”Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told The Associated Press that the higher Social Security tax will slow growth by 0.6 percentage point in 2013. But for the average American worker who earns $41,000 – and will receive $32 less on every biweekly paycheck moving forward – the change will not be an “insubstantial hit,” analysts told FoxNews.com.“And I think a lot of people don’t even realize this is happening,” said  Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at Cato Institute, a Washington-based think tank. “This kind of just slid by the wayside with all the talk of the fiscal cliff.”Simply put, less money “definitely will be” a shock for many Americans toiling in an uncertain economy, Tanner said, adding that many will restrict impulse purchases rather than alter long-term financial planning.“People will have less money in their pockets, so by definition, they’re going to have to make do with less,” he said. “How they change their behavior remains to be seen.”For Ryan Ellis, tax policy director at Americans for Tax Reform, the hike represents a chance for young Americans to take a hard look at Social Security as a whole.“My hope is that people under the age of 40 will start asking serious questions as to why they’re paying more into a Social Security system that they are increasing unlikely to get the full benefit of,” Ellis told FoxNews.com. “I hope everybody does. It’s not a Republican or Democrat thing.”Hoffman, meanwhile, said she already has all the answers she needs.“Any tax increase is not good for young people,” she said. “What it does is diminish your hard work and you’re slapped on the wrist. This administration is punishing people who are making money. They don’t like the concept of free enterprise. They think these problems will be solved in Washington by taking away more of people’s incomes.”	2013-01-11

Revenue rose 14 percent to $9.79 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been expecting earnings of $1.88 per share. A year ago, Deeres net income was $669.6 million, or $1.62 per share.ADVERTISEMENTDeere revenue got a boost from a 4 percent increase in prices, although some of that gain was offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange that hurt sales by 3 percent.Equipment sales rose to $9.05 billion, topping analyst forecasts of $8.93 billion. Sales were strong in the U.S. and Canada, rising 26 percent for the quarter. Elsewhere, sales fell 2 percent. Sales of agriculture and turf equipment rose 16 percent, while construction and forestry equipment sales rose 7 percent.Deere predicted that equipment sales would rise about 5 percent for the fiscal year that began this month, and would increase 10 percent in the first quarter. It expects full-year 2013 net income of about $3.2 billion. Thats a little more than analysts are expecting.Deere is in a good position to carry out its growth plans, but "present global economic and fiscal concerns warrant continued caution," Chairman and CEO Samuel R. Allen said.Moline, Ill.-based Deere is the worlds largest maker of agricultural equipment. It also makes construction and forestry equipment, including backhoes, excavators, riding mowers and leaf blowers. Since it touches so many important manufacturing markets, it has a unique look into the state of the economy, in the U.S. and abroad.Deere expects worldwide sales of agriculture and turf equipment to rise 4 percent in the upcoming year, boosted by high crop prices. However, sales are expected to be flat in the U.S. as livestock and dairy farmers remain cautious. It expects full-year sales in Europe to be flat to down 5 percent. It predicted 10 percent growth in South America. Deere expects worldwide growth of 8 percent for construction equipment, "due in part to modest improvement in U.S. economic conditions."Deere shares fell $2.24, or 2.6 percent, to $83.75 in premarket trading.For the full fiscal year, Deere earned $3.07 billion, or $7.63 per share, up from $2.8 billion, or $6.63 per share, during the prior year. Revenue rose 13 percent to $36.16 billion for the year.	2012-11-21

Rates were unchanged in 33 and rose in 124.ADVERTISEMENTRates dropped below 7 percent in 192 cities. Thats the first time since the recession ended that more than half of large cities had rates below that threshold. And 52 had rates below 5 percent.Major metropolitan areas with low unemployment rates in November included: Oklahoma City, 4.5 percent; New Orleans, 4.7 percent; Washington, 5 percent; and Phoenix, 6.5 percent.Nationwide, the unemployment rate ticked down to 7.8 percent in November from 7.9 percent the previous month. That occurred mostly because more Americans out of work gave up looking for jobs and were not counted as unemployed.Employers added jobs in nearly three-quarters of metro areas in November compared with the same month a year ago. The job gains are compiled from a survey of company payrolls, while the unemployment rates come from a second survey of households.The drop in unemployment rates will probably be reversed in the coming months because temporary workers hired by retailers, shipping companies and other employers are likely to be laid off. Unlike the national data, the metro unemployment rates are not adjusted for seasonal trends. So they tend to be more volatile from month to month.There are still pockets of high unemployment, but they are dwindling. In November, 29 cities reported unemployment rates of 10 percent or higher. Thats down from 35 in October and much lower than 68 cities a year ago.Bismarck, N.D. recorded the lowest unemployment rate, at 2.6 percent. The area is benefiting from an oil and gas drilling boom.The boom has benefited other cities in the region. Fargo, N.D. has the second-lowest rate, at 3 percent.Yuma, Ariz. and El Centro, Calif. reported the highest rates, at 27.5 percent and 26.6 percent, respectively. The two cities have high concentrations of migrant farm workers.	2013-01-08

Thats near the 3.31 percent rate reached in November, the lowest on records dating to 1971.ADVERTISEMENTThe average on the 15-year fixed mortgage ticked down to 2.64 percent from 2.65 percent last week. The record low is 2.63 percent.The 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 3.66 percent in 2012, the lowest annual average in 65 years, according to Freddie Mac.Cheaper mortgages are a key reason the housing market began to come back last year and many economists predict the recovery will strengthen in 2013.In November, sales of previously occupied homes rose to their highest level in three years, while new-home sales reached a 2½ year high. Home prices are steadily increasing, which makes consumers feel wealthier and more likely to spend.Another reason for the recovery: the nation doesnt have enough houses for sale. The number of new homes available for sale at the end of November was just slightly above the lowest on records dating to 1963. And the supply of previously occupied homes for sale was at an 11-year low that month.A limited supply has created demand for new construction, which has made builders more confident.Lower mortgage rates also have persuaded more people to refinance. That typically leads to lower monthly mortgage payments and more spending. Consumer spending drives nearly 70 percent of economic activity.Still, the housing market has a long way to a full recovery. And many people are unable to take advantage of the low rates, either because they cant qualify for stricter lending rules or they lack the money to meet larger down payment requirements.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country on Monday through Wednesday of each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for 30-year loans was 0.7 point, unchanged from last week. The fee for 15-year loans edged down to 0.6 from 0.7 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage rose to 2.57 percent from 2.56 percent. The fee for one-year adjustable-rate loans dipped to 0.4 from 0.5 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage ticked up to 2.71 percent from 2.70 percent last week. The fee declined to 0.6 point from 0.7.	2013-01-03

Probably not, yet millions buy tickets in hopes of record fortune	CHICAGO –  A GOOD BET: SOMEONE WILL WINIts the gamblers mantra: Somebodys gotta win, so why not me?ADVERTISEMENTThe first part is true; somebody will win the Powerball jackpot.Chuck Strutt, executive director of Multi-State Lottery Association, predicts theres about a 60 percent chance itll happen Wednesday — maybe better if theres a flurry of last-minute ticket purchasers picking unique numbers.The jackpot already has defied long odds by rolling over 16 consecutive times without anyone hitting the big prize, which now stands at $425 million ($278.3 million cash value). Strutt puts the odds at around 5 percent there would be no winner in the entire run, including Wednesday.As the drought increases, so too will the chances of it ending on the next draw, because ticket sales spike with a growing jackpot.Someone will win. Eventually.A BAD BET: ITLL BE YOUIts true to say that you have a better chance of being struck by lightning than winning the Powerball. But that woefully understates the danger of lightning.Tim Norfolk, a University of Akron mathematics professor who teaches a course on gambling, puts the odds of a lightning strike in a persons lifetime at 1 in 5,000 (or 1 in 9 million on one particular day). The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot: 1 in 175 million — with no assurances that you wont have to split the prize with others.While weather is the go-to analogy for such astronomical odds, Norfolk suggests there are better ones.For example, youd have a slightly better chance of randomly picking the name of one specific female in the United States: 1 in 157 million, according to the latest census.VICTORY LOVES COMPANYShould you win the jackpot, theres a good chance youll have to share — and not just with family, friends and Uncle Sam.The odds of someone winning increase as the ticket sales do. So, too, do the odds of duplicate tickets, especially for people who choose their own numbers rather than letting the computers pick.Prefer the lucky numbers of 7 or 11? Youre not alone. How about a loved ones birthday? Its 31 or lower — digits more frequently duplicated than 32 and up. (There are 59 white balls and 35 red balls in the draw).Norfolk predicts that if there is a winner, there will be multiple ones because mathematical theory shows that numbers have a way of clustering, even at much smaller sample sizes.If you take 23 random people, theres about a 50-50 chance that at least two will have the same birthday, Norfolk said. Throw choice into the equation — about 20 percent of players typically select their own numbers — and the clusters could be even more defined.That played out in March, when three tickets from Kansas, Maryland and Illinois split the world-record $656 million Mega Millions jackpot.A single ticket holds Powerballs current record of $365 million in 2006, shared by several ConAgra Foods Workers in Lincoln, Neb.FEELING LUCKY IN A BAD ECONOMYGambling experts say a majority of Americans will play some lottery game at least once in a given year.Clyde Barrow, professor director of the Center for Policy Analysis at UMass-Dartmouth, says addicted gamblers are less likely to turn to massive jackpot ticket games like Powerball than scratch-off games."Scratch-off players are looking for instant gratification and an instant win," Barrow said. "A lot of those people dont like playing lotto because you have to wait. You have to sit on it for a few days."While it may seem counterintuitive, Barrow says gambling activity often increases as the economy gets worse and people have less disposable income. However, his research — which focused mainly on New England — found the trend reversed in the latest downturn."The Great Recession has been so deep and so long, its suppressed any kind of discretionary spending across the board," said Barrow, who added about the same percentage of people are playing the lottery — theyre just buying fewer tickets.Strutt, Powerballs executive director, said sales largely stayed flat during the peak of the recession in 2008 and 2009, but picked up since."Our biggest factor is gas prices," he said. "If people go to a gas station and put 80 bucks of gas in their car, theyre not feeling happy to buy a lottery ticket."RIG-PROOF LOTTERY?Its conceivable you could win Wednesday nights drawing, just not the right one.In addition to the official one televised nationally from Tallahassee, Fla., there are four practice runs.The reason, Strutt says, is to make sure the machines are running properly and the numbers are being distributed properly. The balls used in the game are regularly measured, weighed and X-rayed. Then theyre locked up in a room thats under 24/7 surveillance. Only the organizers and their auditors have a key.IS IT A GOOD INVESTMENT?You already know the answer to that. Yet people play anyway.Strutt is estimating that there will be $214 million in sales for Wednesdays drawing (up from $107 million from Saturdays drawing).Half the proceeds go to the prize pool — about a third of that to the big jackpot, with the rest to lower ones, including a new $1 million second prize. The other half goes to the lottery operations on the state level, which funds charitable efforts such as education, in addition to paying for overhead and compensating winning stores.Barrow says its no secret that its not a prudent investment to regularly buy lottery tickets, but contends its a little more defensible as the amount skyrockets.If the jackpot amount approached $600 million, and if you had the means to buy enough tickets until you won, AND if you could guarantee you wouldnt have to share with anyone, then it might be a wise investment.Thats a lot of ifs, Barrow says. But hell likely join the throngs of ticket buyers."For 2 bucks, its worth a chance," he said. "What else am I going to do with that $2? Ill just waste it on something else."	2012-11-26

Theyre helping support an economy slowed by high unemployment, flat pay, sluggish manufacturing and anxious consumers.This year, the number of bank failures has trickled to 51. Thats still well above the roughly five banks that close annually in healthier economies. But its down from 92 failures last year, 157 in 2010 and 140 in 2009.ADVERTISEMENTAs the economy heals from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, more people and businesses are taking out — and repaying — loans.And for the first time since 2009, banks earnings growth is being driven by higher revenue — a healthy trend.	2012-12-28

Thats down from 3.34 percent last week, the previous record low.ADVERTISEMENTThe average on the 15-year fixed mortgage also dropped to 2.63 percent. Thats down from 2.65 percent last week and also a new record.The average rate on the 30-year loan has been below 4 percent all year. It has fallen further since the Federal Reserve started buying mortgage bonds in September to encourage more borrowing and spending.Home sales and construction are rising, providing a much-needed boost to the economy. Home prices are also increasing, which makes consumers feel wealthier and more likely to spend.Lower rates have also persuaded more people to refinance. That usually leads to lower monthly mortgage payments and more spending. Consumer spending drives nearly 70 percent of economic activity.Still, the housing market has a long way to a full recovery. And many people are unable to take advantage of the low rates, either because they cant qualify for stricter lending rules or they cant afford the larger down payments that many banks require.To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country on Monday through Wednesday of each week. The average doesnt include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.The average fee for 30-year loans was 0.7 point, unchanged from last week. The fee for 15-year loans also remained at 0.7 point.The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage ticked up to 2.56 percent from 2.55 percent. The fee for one-year adjustable-rate loans rose two-tenths to 0.5 point.The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage 2.74 percent, the same as the previous week. The fee was unchanged at 0.6 point.	2012-11-21

Both are the best readings since February 2008.ADVERTISEMENTThe index is still below the level of 90 that is consistent with a healthy economy. It last reached that point in December 2007, the first month of the Great Recession. But the index has increased from the all-time low of 25.3 touched in February 2009.Higher consumer confidence could translate into a more robust holiday shopping season and stronger economic growth. Consumer spending drives nearly 70 percent of economic activity.The report also supported the findings of a separate survey from the University of Michigan released last week, which showed consumer sentiment at a five-year high. Still, both surveys increased at slower rates than the previous month.Americans are growing more optimistic because they see the job market getting improving, the Conference Board said. Employers added 171,000 jobs in October and more jobs were created in August and September than first thought.The Conference Board surveyed approximately 5,000 households in the first two weeks of the month. Those surveyed were asked how they felt about the economy and job market now, as well as where they see both going in six months.The survey found that most people viewed current conditions the same as in October. But the percentage of Americans who expect more jobs to be available in the next six months rose to 20.3 percent, from 19.7 percent in October.More Americans said they plan to buy a home, an appliance or take a vacation, the survey found. But the percentage expecting to buy a car fell.Many of the participants in the Michigan survey said they expect the unemployment rate to drop over the next six months. Still, some expressed concerns about the "fiscal cliff," a package of sharp tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect next year unless Congress and the White House can replace them. The tax increases would leave consumers with much less money to spend.A better housing market may also be contributing to consumers better mood.Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller reported Tuesday that its 20-city index of home prices rose 3 percent in September compared with the same month last year. Prices also gained 3.6 percent in the July-September quarter compared with the same quarter in 2011.Across the nation, prices increased in 18 of 20 cities over the 12-month period.	2012-11-27

Others adjusted their travel schedules to try to save money, flying on less popular days or to airports that were a bit farther from their destination.ADVERTISEMENTThe weather, along with the economy, handed setbacks to some. Heavy fog shrouded Chicago, causing more than 1,600 delays or cancellations in and out of its two airports and sending ripples around the nation.And at New York Citys Penn Station, a power failure in a switching system halted all trains for more than an hour at the height of the evening commute. It caused delays of 90 minutes or more on Amtrak and two of the nations busiest commuter railroads.The effects of Superstorm Sandy added to the hassle for travelers on the East Coast.Chris McLaughlin, a 22-year-old senior at Boston College from West Chester, Penn., had hoped to combine his trip home for Thanksgiving with a medical school interview in Philadelphia, but the storm delayed his interview, so hell have to make an extra trip home next month. He figured that would cost him another $200."It killed me," McLaughlin said of the financial impact of the storm, which also left his parents without power for eight days. "I think we were feeling we could loosen up a little bit (financially), but with Sandy and everything that happened, (people) feel like they cant."And its not just family finances that are tighter. Airlines struggling to save on jet fuel and other expenses have cut the number of flights, leading to a jump in airfares. Those hitting the roads face high gas prices and rising tolls.After a couple of years of healthy post-recession growth, Thanksgiving travel this year was expected to be up only slightly, 0.7 percent, from last year, according to AAAs yearly Thanksgiving travel analysis. Among the 43.6 million Americans expected to journey 50 miles or more between Wednesday and Sunday, more were driving and fewer were flying. Their planned trips were shorter too, by about 120 miles on average, the travel organization said.As car ownership declines among younger Americans, many of those hitting the road were jumping onto buses. Intercity bus service has grown in recent years with curbside companies like Megabus.At a Greyhound terminal in downtown Denver, Eileen Lindbuchler, a 32-year-old massage therapist, hauled her bulky massage table through the line to board a bus. She had used her iPhone to coordinate bus schedules and connecting routes for the 65-mile journey to visit family in Colorado Springs and expected the effort to save her money."I think its going to be a lot cheaper," she said. "I want to see how it works. Ive always had to travel by car."Aided by smartphone apps, social media and other technology, consumers are getting better at sniffing out deals and realize they need to be flexible with dates and even the airports they chose when booking, said Courtney Scott, a senior editor at Travelocity."I think people are really becoming smarter, more creative travelers and shoppers," Scott said.Sometimes, though, no amount of creativity with an airline booking can avoid breaking the bank for those with large families.So, Linne Katz and her five children hit the road, leaving their home in Haledon, N.J., at 1 a.m. Wednesday in hopes of getting to her fathers home in Tennessee while the sun was still up. Driving has downsides, she said."My oldest keeps having to go the bathroom. ... I think hes getting carsick," Katz said, as she stopped to take pictures of her children under the "Virginia Welcomes You" sign at an I-66 rest stop near the Manassas National Battlefield.And even with all the alternatives to flying, some still said they couldnt afford the journey.Lisa Appleton, 42, of Sandy Springs, Ga., said she lost her job as an accounting manager during the holidays last year. Her new job at an ice skating rink pays less, and she said that forced her to skip her usual Thanksgiving road trip to visit family in northeast Ohio."This is the first year that I have not gone in like five years," she said. "It seems weird to me."She planned to spend the holiday at home with her 23-year-old son, eating and watching football. After checking airline prices, she decided theyll also stay in Georgia for Christmas."It breaks my heart, but its something youve got to do," she said. "If you dont have the money, you just — you cant do it."___Associated Press writers Maryclaire Dale in Philadelphia, P.

Rents and airline fares also rose. Gasoline prices fell a seasonally adjusted 2.3 percent.ADVERTISEMENTThe flat reading of the December consumer price index ends a year when inflation slowed. Consumer prices rose only 1.7 percent in 2012, down from 3 percent in 2011. Food prices increased 1.8 percent, down from 4.7 percent in 2011. Energy prices rose slightly.Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices ticked up just 0.1 percent in December compared with November. And core prices rose only 1.9 percent in 2012. Thats below the Federal Reserves inflation target of 2 percent and its lower than 2011s increase of 2.2 percent.Mild inflation leaves consumers with more money to spend, which is good for the economy. Lower inflation also makes it easier for the Fed to continue with its efforts to accelerate the economy. If the Fed were worried that prices are rising too fast, it might have to raise interest rates.With job gains and economic growth steady but modest, many businesses are reluctant to raise prices for fear of losing customers. Thats helped keep inflation tame. Workers also arent able to demand higher wages when growth is weak. That limits their ability to pay more.Gas prices have fallen sharply in recent months after spiking this summer. Prices at the pump averaged $3.29 a gallon nationwide on Wednesday. Thats about the same as a month ago and well below summer prices that nearly touched $4 a gallon.Prices are likely to stay low in the early months of 2013, based on a measure of wholesale prices reported Tuesday.The producer price index, which measures price changes before they reach the consumer, fell for the third straight month in December. Wholesale food prices dropped by the most in 19 months, largely because of a sharp drop in beef and veal costs. Vegetable and cheese prices also declined.Not everything was cheaper at the wholesale level. The cost of womens and girls clothes jumped by the most in nine years. Fresh fruit prices also rose.With inflation tame, the Fed has ramped up its efforts to boost growth. It decided last month to keep buying $85 billion a month in Treasurys and mortgage bonds in an effort to lower borrowing costs and encourage more spending.The Fed also said last month that it planned to keep its key short-term interest rate at a record low even after unemployment falls to 6.5 percent — which it said might take three more years. Unemployment remains high at 7.8 percent.	2013-01-16

The modest gain suggests the economy entered the new year with some momentum.The Institute for Supply Management said Wednesday that its index of manufacturing activity rose to 50.7 in December from 49.5 in the previous month. Novembers reading was the lowest reading since July 2009, one month after the recession ended.ADVERTISEMENTA reading above 50 signals expansion.A measure of employment rose to the highest level in three months, suggesting that factories are adding jobs.The closely watched survey was completed before Congress reached a deal to avoid the "fiscal cliff."The last-minute deal passed Tuesday averts widespread tax increases and delays deep spending cuts that had threatened to push the country back into recession. Still, most Americans will see some increase in taxes this year, which will likely slow consumer spending.There have been some positive signs for factory output. In November, companies substantially increased their orders for a category of large equipment that reflects their investment plans. That followed a big increase in the same category in October.The economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, much better than the 1.3 percent pace in the April-June quarter. But economists expect growth will slow in the current quarter, partly because of the uncertainties surrounding the fiscal cliff, to below a 2 percent pace.	2013-01-02

But the government said employers added 49,000 fewer jobs in October and September than initially estimated. And the unemployment rate fell from 7.9 percent in October mostly because more people stopped looking for work and werent counted as unemployed.Still, there were signs that the storm disrupted economic activity.

But some workers could be rehired, it said, and the one-of-a-kind awards will still be produced on Chicagos north side.R.S. Owens & Co. Inc. said in a notice this week to the Illinois Department of Commerce that it will lay off 95 of its roughly 250 workers on Dec. 17, the day it will be taken over by St. Regis Crystal. St. Regis has been an Owens competitor with home offices in Markham, Ontario, and Indianapolis.ADVERTISEMENTOwens has made the statues for about 30 years and will continue to manufacture both the Oscars and the Emmy Awards statues, company President Scott Siegel said Friday. Most of the laid-off employees have applied for jobs with St. Regis, he said, though not all will be rehired.Siegel, whose grandfather, Owen Siegel, started the company in 1938, said the company has struggled for several years. He blames its troubles on Americas economic slowdown and competition from Chinese companies that have lower production costs."Theres definitely some bittersweetness in that a third-generation, almost 75-year-old company is in a position where, due to the economy and due to China, we were forced to look to another company to partner with," Siegel said. "Im hopeful however with the investment of capital in our company by St. Regis that well be perhaps able to automate more in the future and compete."The 64-year-old Owens has worked for the company full-time since 1980, but said he worked there often even as a child.Becoming the Oscar manufacturer in the early 80s, he said, "was a huge deal."About 50 of the 13 1/2-inch-tall, half-pound statues are manufactured every year for the Academy Awards. The statues are made of a metal called brittanium, whose makeup is proprietary, and coated in gold.Siegel said R.S. Owens will start work on the Oscar statues soon in advance of the Feb. 24 show. But right now, the factory is producing, among other things, trophies for this years Cotton Bowl.Part of the labor cost problem, Siegel said, is the time spent polishing the statues by hand."Just on the statuette, theres over an hour of polishing," he said, "and on the base theres probably 45 minutes of polishing."St. Regis President Richard Firkser said that labor-intensive process is part of the reason his company is buying R.S. Owens."Its really the workmanship of the artisans in Chicago that make it happen," he said. "Unfortunately, it doesnt make economic sense to hire back each and every employee."Firkser said he doesnt know yet how many will be rehired, and he declined to say how much St. Regis is paying for R.S. Owens.The Owens name will continue to be used for the Oscars and other products made in Chicago.An email request for comment sent by The Associated Press to The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was not returned.	2012-12-07

The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased 6,750 to 365,750, after falling to a four-year low the previous week.ADVERTISEMENTA department spokesman says all states reported data and none were estimated. In the previous two weeks, many states were estimated because they werent able to report data over the holidays.Weekly applications are a proxy for layoffs. They have fluctuated for most of the past 12 months between 360,000 and 390,000. At the same time, job growth has been modest but steady.Employers added 155,000 jobs in December, the department said last week, while the unemployment rate remained 7.8 percent. The gain in hiring nearly matched the average of 153,000 jobs per month in 2011 and 2012. Thats just been enough to slowly push down the unemployment rate, which fell 0.7 percentage points in 2012.Decembers steady job gain suggests employers didnt cut back on hiring in the midst of the debate over the tax and spending changes known as the fiscal cliff. Many economists feared that the prospect of higher taxes and steep cuts in federal spending would cause a slowdown in job gains.Thats a good sign, since more budget showdowns are expected. Congress must vote to raise the governments $16.4 trillion borrowing limit by around late February. If not, the government risks defaulting on its debt. Republicans will likely demand deep spending cuts as the price of raising the debt limit.Still, hiring is too weak to rapidly reduce the number of unemployed, which stands at 12.2 million. Thats far higher than the 7.6 million who were out of work when the Great Recession began in December 2007.There are signs the economy is improving. The once-battered housing market is recovering, which should lead to more construction jobs in the coming months. A gauge of U.S. service firms business activity expanded in December by the most in nearly a year. Auto sales for 2012 were the best in five years.

A greater number of owners in storm-battered states said they planned to cut their payrolls — not surprising considering that many businesses hit hard by the Oct. 29 storm are still unable to open.Dunkelberg said the survey points to the election results as the biggest factor in owners darker mood.	2012-12-11

But fire officials say it involved one of the planes lithium ion batteries. The 787 is Boeings first plane to use those batteries. In 2007 federal officials issued special rules for them because of concerns about the risk of fire.ADVERTISEMENTInvestors are eager for Boeing to profit from its big investment in the plane, and theyre nervous about potential setbacks.Boeing shares fell 3.3 percent to $73.64 in afternoon trading. Theyve fallen 5.2 percent since their Friday close, erasing more than $3 billion of market value.The Monday fire was on a Japan Airlines 787.	2013-01-08

The NFIBs small-business-optimism index rose half a point from its level in November to 88. The index remains near its lowest readings on record.ADVERTISEMENTThe survey was completed on Dec. 28, four days before the House voted for a bill that spared tax increases on the middle class and postponed steep budget cuts.The NFIB says its January survey may more accurately reflect how owners feel. With year-end political and tax issues resolved, they can focus on the economy.The December index reading was lifted in part by owners slightly higher expectations that their sales would rise in 2013. Employment in the sector was virtually unchanged.And it was clear that they were waiting to see the outcome of the talks in Washington before making plans to invest in equipment or expand. More than half — 52 percent — said they did not want to take out a loan. Companies often borrow when theyre getting ready to expand — or hire.The NFIB questioned 648 of its members selected at random for the survey.	2013-01-08

FedEx has said previously that the buyouts should reduce "fixed head count by several thousand people."Those eligible will be notified in February, and have until April to apply. Theyll find out in May if they are accepted. The first wave of employees will leave on May 31, the last day of FedExs fiscal year. The next wave will leave six months later and the final tranche will depart on May 31, 2014.Founder and CEO Fred Smith said in August that most of the cuts will come in the companys Express and Services units, which have been hurt the most by the global economic conditions. A majority of those employees are in the U.S.The Express unit is where FedEx got its start in 1971, and it is still the companys biggest segment by far. The division moves 3.5 million packages on an average day, mostly by air. Its been hit hard as customers shift to slower delivery methods such as ground delivery and ocean shipping to conserve cash. Also, as technology products get lighter, FedEx charges less to ship them. Apple Inc.s iPhone 5, for example, is 17 percent lighter than the first generation model.Express has more than 146,000 employees worldwide — roughly two-thirds of those are in the U.S.FedEx Services is FedExs behind-the-scenes logistics division, but it also includes FedEx Office, formerly Kinkos. It is one of FedExs smallest units, with 13,000 employees, all based in the U.S.FedEx, which is based in Memphis, Tenn., also plans to shed aircraft and underused assets to cut costs.FedExs larger rival United Parcel Service Inc., which is based Atlanta, has also said its reducing costs to make up for slow growth in the global economy.Shares of FedEx rose 65 cents to $88.78 in afternoon trading Tuesday. UPS shares rose 84 cents to $73.11._____Samantha Bomkamp can be reached at www.twitter.com/SamWillTravel	2012-12-04
1291	http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/11/19/judge-puts-hostess-liquidation-on-hold-orders-talks/	Judge puts Hostess liquidation on hold, orders talks	The liquidation of Hostess has been put on hold after a federal judge ordered the company and union officials to come back to the table for more talks, Fox Business Network reported.The union that brought the 85-year-old baker of Twinkies and Wonder Bread to its knees was holding out hope that a buyer will salvage chunks of the company and send the unions members back to work, even as Hostess Brands Inc. had geared up for a fire sale.ADVERTISEMENTHostess, the company behind treats snacked on for generations, presented to a federal bankruptcy judge a plan to shut down 36 plants and sell off the companys business. Their liquidation plan was sparked by a nationwide strike orchestrated by the snack makers second-largest union, the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers.The Wall Street Journal reports that while Hostess has said the shutdown would result in the loss of more than 18,000 jobs and place the fate of more than 30 American brands in jeopardy, union President Frank Hurt said he believed there was "more than a good chance" that a buyer quickly would swoop in to buy the profitable parts of the company and give his unions members their jobs back."Im not in a position to promise anybody anything, but Im in a position to be hopeful," he said Sunday to the Journal.Hurt, whose union counts 5,600 Hostess employees as members, said he was comforted by the recent frenzy over Hostess products, as consumers rushed to stock up after Fridays announcement of the shutdown. "People are going crazy because they think theyre not going to be able to get any Twinkies or Ho Hos or Wonder Bread," he also said in the interview. "Theyll be produced somewhere, some time and by our members."Hostess Chief Executive Gregory Rayburn had a different vision of how the bankruptcy auction process would play out."Nobody wants to have anything to do with these old plants or these unions or these contracts," Rayburn said in an interview. The company had hunted for buyers for the last several years as it tried to avoid a second trip into bankruptcy, but no buyer came forward.   	2012-11-19
